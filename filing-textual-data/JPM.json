Other factors that could affect our financial condition and operations are discussed in the Forward-looking statements section on page 135. However, factors besides those discussed below, in MDA or elsewhere in this or other reports that we filed or furnished with the SEC, also could adversely affect us. You should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect us. Our results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by U.S. and international financial market and economic conditions. Our businesses have been, and in the future will continue to be, materially affected by economic and market conditions, including factors such as the liquidity of the global financial markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates and currency and commodities prices; investor sentiment; corporate or other scandals that reduce confidence in the financial markets; inflation; the availability and cost of capital and credit; the occurrence of natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism; and the degree to which U.S. or international economies are expanding or experiencing recessionary pressures. These factors can affect, among other things, the activity levels of clients with respect to the size, number and timing of transactions involving our investment and commercial banking businesses, including our underwriting and advisory businesses; the realization of cash returns from our private equity and principal investments businesses; the volume of transactions that we execute for our customers and, therefore, the revenue we receive from commissions and spreads; the number and size of underwritings we manage on behalf of clients; and the willingness of financial sponsors or other investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by us.We generally maintain large trading portfolios in the fixed income, currency, commodity and equity markets and we may have from time to time significant positions, including positions in securities in markets that lack pricing transparency or liquidity. The revenue derived from mark-to-market values of our businesses are affected by many factors, including our credit standing; our success in effectively hedging our market and other risks; volatility in interest rates and equity, debt and commodities markets; credit spreads and availability of liquidity in the capital markets; and other economic and business factors. We anticipate that revenue relating to our trading and principal investment businesses will continue to experience volatility and there can be no assurance that such volatility relating to the above factors or other conditions that may affect pricing or our ability to realize returns from such investments could not materially adversely affect our earnings. The fees we earn for managing third-party assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in trading markets could affect the valuations of the third-party assets we manage or hold in custody, which, in turn, could affect our revenue. Moreover, even in the absence of a market downturn, below-market or sub-par performance by our investment management businesses could result in outflows of assets under management and supervision and, therefore, reduce the fees that we receive. During 2008, U.S. and global financial markets were extremely volatile and were materially and adversely affected by a significant lack of liquidity, loss of confidence in the financial sector, disruptions in the credit markets, reduced business activity, rising unemployment, declining home prices, and erosion of consumer confidence. These factors contributed to adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations in 2008 and into early 2009. While the business environment stabilized during the latter half of 2009, the current economic environment remains weak, which affects our businesses profitability. Our consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions. Such conditions include U.S. interest rates; the rate of unemployment; housing prices; the level of consumer confidence; changes in consumer spending; and the number of personal bankruptcies, among others. The deterioration of these conditions can diminish demand for the consumer businesses products and services, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. In addition, adverse economic conditions, such as declines in home prices, could lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can adversely affect our earnings. During 2008 and continuing in 2009, higher levels of bank failures have dramatically increased resolution costs of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and depleted the deposit insurance fund. In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC has increased assessment rates of insured institutions and adopted a rule in November 2009 requiring banks to prepay three years worth of premiums to replenish the depleted insurance fund. If there are additional bank or financial institutions failures, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. Any future increases of FDIC insurance premiums may adversely impact our earnings. In connection with the sale and securitization of loans (whether with or without recourse), the originator is generally required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding both the originator and the loans being sold or securitized. We and certain of our subsidiaries, as well as entities acquired by us as part of the Bear Stearns merger, and the Washington Mutual and other transactions, have made such representations and warranties in connection with the sale and securitization of loans, and we will continue to do so in the ordinary course of our lending business. If a loan does not comply with such representations or warranties is sold or securitized, we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such losses. In 2009, the costs of repurchasing mortgage loans that had been sold to government agencies such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae increased substantially, and could continue to increase substantially further. Accordingly, repurchase and/or indemnity obligations to government-sponsored enterprises or to private third-party purchasers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and earnings in the future. We cannot provide assurance that any of the above-mentioned conditions, or further continued deterioration in economic, market or business conditions, will not have a material negative effect on the Firm in the future. If we do not effectively manage our liquidity, our business could be negatively affected. Our liquidity is critical to our ability to operate our businesses, grow and be profitable. Some potential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include illiquid or volatile markets, diminished access to capital markets, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including, among others, commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities (SPEs) or other entities), difficulty or inability to sell assets, unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, and lack of market or customer confidence in us or our prospects. These conditions may be caused by events over which we have little or no control. For example, the liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased our cost of funding and limited our access to some of our traditional sources of liquidity such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, loans, credit card receivables and other assets. These or other conditions detrimental to our liquidity may occur in the future.The credit ratings of JPMorgan Chase  Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. are important in order to maintain our liquidity. A reduction in their credit ratings could have an adverse effect on our access to liquidity sources, increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us, thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing our profitability. Reduction in the ratings of certain SPEs or other entities to which we have a funding or other commitment could also negatively affect our liquidity where such ratings changes lead, directly or indirectly, to us being required to purchase assets or otherwise provide funding. Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, diverse funding sources, and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. Our cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads (the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities (or other benchmark securities) of the same maturity that we need to pay to our debt investors). Increases in our credit spreads can significantly increase the cost of this funding. Changes in credit spreads are continuous and market-driven, and influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness. As such, our credit spreads may be unpredictable and highly volatile. Part I As a holding company, we rely on the earnings of our subsidiaries for our cash flow and consequent ability to pay dividends and satisfy our obligations. These payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, loans or other payments. Several of our principal subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy requirements or other regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments. Limitations in the payments we receive from our subsidiaries could negatively affect our liquidity position.The financial condition of our customers, clients and counterparties, including other financial institutions, could adversely affect us .A number of our products expose us to credit risk, including loans, leases and lending commitments, derivatives, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale. As one of the nations largest lenders, we have exposures to many different products and counterparties, and the credit quality of our exposures can have a significant impact on our earnings. We estimate and establish reserves for credit risks and potential credit losses inherent in our credit exposure (including unfunded lending commitments). This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the chance that we will fail to identify the proper factors or that we will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that we identify. Any such failure could result in increases in delinquencies and default rates.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by the counterparty or client, which can be exacerbated during periods of market illiquidity, such as experienced in 2008 and early 2009. During such periods, our credit risk also may be further increased when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. In addition, disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral significantly increases in times of market stress and illiquidity. We cannot provide assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.An example of the risks associated with our relationships with other financial institutions is the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LBHI). On September 15, 2008, LBHI filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, and thereafter several of its subsidiaries also filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (LBHI and such subsidiaries collectively, Lehman). On September 19, 2008, a liquidation case under the Securities Investor Protection Act (SIPA) was commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for Lehman Brothers Inc. (LBI), LBHIs U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary, and that court now presides over the LBI SIPA liquidation case. We were LBIs clearing bank and,among other actions, made collateral calls totaling approximately $8 billion in September 2008 and liquidated approximately $18 billion of securities subsequent to Lehmans bankruptcy filing. We are the largest secured creditor in the Lehman and LBI cases, according to Lehmans schedules. It is possible that claims may be asserted against us and/or our security interests, including by the LBHI Creditors Committee, the SIPA Trustee appointed in the LBI liquidation case, the principal acquirer of LBIs assets, and others in connection with Lehman and LBI cases. We intend to defend ourself against any such claims. The LBHI examiner has filed a report with the Bankruptcy Court regarding his investigation into the collapse of Lehman. The report remains under seal.If the current weak economic environment continues for an extended period of time, or deteriorates further, there is a greater likelihood that more of our customers or counterparties could become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to us which, in turn, could result in a higher level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, or requirements that we purchase assets or provide other funding, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition. Moreover, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to concerns about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry, thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure, and increasing the losses, including mark-to-market losses, we could incur in our trading and clearing businesses.Concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses. We have exposure to increased levels of risk when a number of customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. We regularly monitor various segments of our portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks. Our efforts to diversify or hedge our credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful and any concentration of credit risk could increase the potential for significant losses in our credit portfolio. In addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell, syndicate or realize upon securities, loans or other instruments or positions held by us, thereby leading to increased concentrations of such positions. These concentrations could expose us to losses if the mark-to-market value of the securities, loans or other instruments or positions decline causing us to take write downs. Moreover, the inability to reduce our positions not only increases the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but also increases the level of risk-weighted assets on our balance sheet, thereby increasing our capital requirements and funding costs, all of which could adversely affect our businesses operations and profitability.Our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us. Our risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, marketrisk, interest rate risk, operational risk, legal and fiduciary risk, reputational risks and private equity risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. Our risk management strategies may not be effective because in a difficult or less liquid market environment other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the difficult market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for us to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants. Our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument. In addition, certain of our derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities, commodities or obligations that we do not own; if we are not able to obtain such securities, commodities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery, this could cause us to forfeit payments otherwise due to us and could result in settlement delays, which could damage our reputation and ability to transact future business. In addition, in situations where derivatives transactions are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis, we may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, we may find the contract more difficult to enforce. Further, as new and more complex derivative products are created, disputes regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of the contracts could arise, which could force us to incur unexpected costs, including transaction and legal costs, and impair our ability to manage effectively our risk exposure from these products. Many of our hedging strategies and other risk management techniques have a basis in historic market behavior, and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on managements subjective judgment. For example, many models used by us are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, such as occurred during 2008, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements. These sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited the effectiveness of our risk management strategies, causing us to incur losses. In addition, as our businesses change and grow and the markets in which they operate continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. For example, there is the risk that the credit and market risks associated with new products or new business strategies may not be appropriately identified, monitored or managed. We cannot provide assurance that our risk management framework, including our underlying assumptions or strategies, will at all times be accurate and effective. Our operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary, political, legal and other developments in the United States and around the world. Our businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the United States, non-U.S. governments and international agencies.The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments. The market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of financial assets that we hold, such as debt securities and mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). Its policies also can adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us. Changes in Federal Reserve Board policies are beyond our control and, consequently, the impact of these changes on our activities and results of operations is difficult to predict. Our businesses and revenue are also subject to the risks inherent in maintaining international operations and in investing and trading in securities of companies worldwide. These risks include, among others, risk of loss from the outbreak of hostilities or acts of terrorism and various unfavorable political, economic, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, and changes in laws and regulations. Further, various countries in which we operate or invest, or in which we may do so in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to that country or region, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, or low or negative growth, among other negative conditions. Crime, corruption, war or military actions, acts of terrorism and a lack of an established legal and regulatory framework are additional challenges in some of these countries, particularly in certain emerging markets. Revenue from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets. Also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can, and has in the past, affected our operations and investments in another country or countries, including our operations in the U.S. Any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our power generation and commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation, potential catastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose us to significant cost and liability. We engage in power generation, and in connection with the commodities activities of our Investment Bank, we engage in the storage, transportation, marketing or trading of severalPart I commodities, including metals, agricultural products, crude oil, oil products, natural gas, electric power, emission credits, coal, freight, and related products and indices. We have also invested in companies engaged in wind energy and in sourcing, developing and trading emission reduction credits. As a result of these activities, we are subject to extensive and evolving energy, commodities, environmental, and other governmental laws and regulations. We expect laws and regulations affecting our power generation and commodities activities to expand in scope and complexity. We may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations and the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. In addition, liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations for remediation of contaminations. Our power generation and commodities activities also further exposes us to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events, including natural disasters, leaks, spills, explosions, release of toxic substances, fires, accidents on land and at sea, wars, and terrorist attacks that could result in personal injuries, loss of life, property damage, damage to our reputation and suspension of operations. In addition, our power generation activities are subject to disruptions, many of which are outside of our control, from the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment, transmission lines or other equipment or processes, and the contractual failure of performance by third-party suppliers or service providers, including the failure to obtain and deliver raw materials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities. Our actions to mitigate our risks related to the abovementioned considerations may not prove adequate to address every contingency. In addition, insurance covering some of these risks may not be available, and the proceeds, if any, from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by such events.We rely on our systems, employees and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations. Our businesses are dependent on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of increasingly complex transactions. If any of our financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be materially adversely affected. We are similarly dependent on our employees. We could be materially adversely affected if one of our employees causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems. Third parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk to us, including relating to breakdowns or failures of such parties own systems or employees. Any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses, or result in potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, any of which could materially adversely affect us.If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in our possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or such information was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. We may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which may include, for example, computer viruses, electrical or telecommunications outages, or other damage to our property or assets; natural disasters; health emergencies or pandemics; or events arising from local or larger scale political events, including terrorist acts. Such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to us. In a firm as large and complex as ours, lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time, and there is no assurance that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls may not occur in the future. In addition, there is the risk that our controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems could prove to be inadequate. Any such failure could adversely affect our operations and results of operations by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as by exposing us to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance. We operate within a highly regulated industry and our business and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which we are subject. We are subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as well as the applicable laws of each of the various other jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which we do business. These laws and regulations affect the type and manner in which we do business and may limit our ability to expand our product offerings, pursue acquisitions, or restrict the scope of operations and services provided.Recent market and economic conditions have led to new legislation and numerous proposals for changes in the regulation of the financial services industry, including significant additional legislation and regulation in the United States. For example, new legislation and regulation affecting the credit card industry is expected to adversely affect our Card Services business by reducing revenue and increasing compliance costs. Recent proposals for further regulation of financial institutions, both domestically and internationally, include calls to increase their capital and liquidity requirements; limit the size and types of the activities permitted; and increase taxes on some institutions. For example, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009 recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives would, among other things, establish a Consumer Financial Protection Agency having broad authority to regulate providers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services, as well as create a structure to regulate systemically important financial companies, and provide regulators with the power to require such companies to sell or transfer assets and terminate activities if the regulators determine that the size or scope of activities of the company pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the company or the financial stability of the United States. Also proposed is more comprehensive regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market, including providing for more strict capital and margin requirements, the central clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives, and heightened supervision of all over-the-counter derivatives dealers and major market participants, including the Firm. These new (and other) legislative and regulatory changes could result in significant loss of revenue, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in, impact the value of assets that we hold, require us to change certain of our business practices, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our businesses. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that any such new legislation or regulation would not have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If we do not comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to our operations, we may be subject to fines, penalties or material restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred. In recent years, regulatory oversight and enforcement have increased substantially, imposing additional costs and increasing the potential risks associated with our operations. As this regulatory trend continues, it could adversely affect our operations and, in turn, our financial results. We face significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against us. We are named as a defendant or are otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties, as well as investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies. Actions brought against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation, or cause us serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely we will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny and investigations related to our businesses and operations.There is increasing competition in the financial services industry which may adversely affect our results of operations. We operate in a highly competitive environment and we expect competitive conditions to continue to intensify as continued merger activity in the financial services industry produces larger, better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices.We also face an increasing array of competitors. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and Internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading. Our businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of our products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for our products and services or may cause us to lose market share. Increased competition also may require us to make additional capital investment in our businesses in order to remain competitive. These investments may increase expense or may require us to extend more of our capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger, more competitive transactions. We cannot provide assurance that the significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect our future results of operations. Our acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses may not result in all of the benefits anticipated. We have in the past and may in the future seek to grow our business by acquiring other businesses. There can be no assurance that our acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results, including results relating to: the total cost of integration; the time required to complete the integration; the amount of longer-term cost savings; the overall performance of the combined entity; or an improved price for our common stock. Integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly, sometimes including combining relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls, as well as managing relevant relationships with employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners. Integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our operations or results. We cannot provide assurance that any integration efforts of acquisitions already consummated or any new acquisitions would not result in the occurrence of unanticipated costs or losses.We may continue to experience increased credit costs or need to take additional markdowns and allowances for loan losses on the assets and loans acquired in the merger (the Bear Stearns merger) by JPMorgan Chase and The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. (Bear Stearns) and in connection with the acquisition of Washington Mutual Banks (Washington Mutual) banking operations (the Washington Mutual transaction). We cannot assure you that as our integration efforts continue in connection with these transactions, other unanticipated costs or losses will not be incurred. Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause us to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from us and move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees. The loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business. Damage to our reputation could damage our businesses. Maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees. Damage to ourPart I reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, compliance failures, unethical behavior, and the activities of customers and counterparties. Further, negative publicity regarding us, whether or not true, may result in harm to our prospects.Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect our reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole. We could suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest. Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among our clients. The failure to adequately address, or the perceived failure to adequately address, conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions. Therefore, there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us. Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance. Our employees are our most important resource and, in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The imposition on us or on our employees of certain of the currently proposed restrictions or taxes on executive compensation may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees. If we are unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, our performance, including our competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.Our financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if wrong, could cause unexpected losses in the future. Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigations and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.Certain of our financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, available-for-sale securities, certain loans, MSRs, private equity investments, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, being based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B: UNRESOLVED SEC STAFF COMMENTS None. ", "2": " ITEM 2: PROPERTIES JPMorgan Chases headquarters is located in New York City at 270 Park Avenue, which is a 50-story office building owned by JPMorgan Chase. This location contains approximately 1.3 million square feet of space. The building is currently undergoing a major renovation in five stages. The design seeks to attain the highest sustainability rating for renovations of existing buildings under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System. The renovations of floors 15  50 are complete. The renovation of the exterior Plaza and the lobby began in the fourth quarter 2009. The total renovation is expected to be substantially completed by mid-year 2011. In connection with the Bear Stearns merger in 2008, JPMorgan Chase acquired 383 Madison Avenue in New York City, a 45-story, 1.1 million square-foot office building on land which is subject to a ground lease through 2096. This building serves as the U.S. headquarters of JPMorgan Chases Investment Bank. In total, JPMorgan Chase owned or leased approximately 12.9 million square feet of commercial office and retail space in New York City at December 31, 2009. JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries also own or lease significant administrative and operational facilities in Houston and Dallas, Texas (4.4 million square feet); Chicago, Illinois (3.9 million square feet); Columbus, Ohio (2.7 million square feet); Phoenix, Arizona (1.4 million square feet); Jersey City, New Jersey (1.2 million square feet); San Francisco, California (1.0 million square feet); Seattle, Washington (1.0 million square feet); Wilmington, Delaware (1.0 million square feet); and 5,154 retail branches in 23 states. At December 31, 2009, the Firm occupied approximately 72.5 million total square feet of space in the United States. At December 31, 2009, the Firm managed and occupied approximately 3.7 million total square feet of space in Europe, Middle East and Africa. In the United Kingdom, JPMorgan Chase leased approximately 2.6 million square feet of office space and owned a 360,000 square-foot operations center at December 31, 2009. In 2008, JPMorgan Chase acquired a 999-year leasehold interest in land at Canary Wharf, London, as the possible future site for construction of a new European headquarters building. Initially, the design was for a building area of 1.9 million square feet and up to five trading floors; it is now modified to 1.7 million square feet and up to four trading floors. JPMorgan Chase is currently in the design development stage and continues to identify and evaluate further opportunities to modify the design. JPMorgan Chase, by agreement with the developer (as renegotiated in 2009), has the ability to defer commencement of the main construction through at least October 2011. JPMorgan Chase is reconsidering its occupancy options in London during this deferral period. The building design will strive to achieve the highest possible environmental efficiency rating. In addition, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries occupy offices and other administrative and operational facilities in the Asia Pacific region, Latin America and Canada under various types of ownership and leasehold agreements, aggregating approximately 4.4 million total square feet of space at December 31, 2009. The properties occupied by JPMorgan Chase are used across all of the Firms business segments and for corporate purposes. JPMorgan Chase continues to evaluate its current and projected space requirements and may determine from time to time that certain of its premises and facilities are no longer necessary for its operations. There is no assurance that the Firm will be able to dispose of any such excess premises or that it will not incur charges in connection with such dispositions. Such disposition costs may be material to the Firms results of operations in a given period. ", "3": " ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Bear Stearns Shareholder Litigation and Related Matters. Various shareholders of Bear Stearns have commenced purported class actions against Bear Stearns and certain of its former officers and/or directors on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired common stock of Bear Stearns between December 14, 2006 and March 14, 2008 (the Class Period). The actions, originally commenced in several federal courts, allege that the defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding Bear Stearns business and financial results and that, as a result of those false statements, Bear Stearns common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period. In connection with these allegations, the complaints assert claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Separately, several individual shareholders of Bear Stearns have commenced or threatened to commence arbitration proceedings and lawsuits asserting claims similar to those in the putative class actions. In addition, Bear Stearns and certain of its former officers and/or directors have also been named as defendants in a number of purported class actions commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to represent the interests of participants in the Bear Stearns Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) during the time period of December 2006 to March 2008. These actions allege that defendants breached their fiduciary duties to plaintiffs and to the other participants and beneficiaries of the ESOP by (a) failing to manage prudently the ESOPs investment in Bear Stearns securities; (b) failing to communicate fully and accurately about the risks of the ESOPs investment in Bear Stearns stock; (c) failing to avoid or address alleged conflicts of interest; and (d) failing to monitor those who managed and administered the ESOP. In connection with these allegations, each plaintiff asserts claims for violations under various sections of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and seeks reimbursement to the ESOP for all losses, an unspecified amount of monetary damages and imposition of a constructive trust. Bear Stearns, former members of Bear Stearns Board of Directors and certain of Bear Stearns former executive officers have also been named as defendants in two purported shareholder derivative suits, subsequently consolidated into one action, pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs are asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, violations of federal securities laws, waste of corporate assets and gross mismanagement, unjust enrichment, abuse of control and indemnification and contribution in connection with the losses sustained by Bear Stearns as a result of its purchases of subprime loans and certain repurchases of its own common stock. Certain individual defendants are also alleged to have sold their holdings of Bear Stearns common stock while in possession of material nonpublic information. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in an unspecified amount and an order directing Bear Stearns to improve its corporate governance procedures. Plaintiffs later filed a second amended complaint asserting, for the first time, purported class action claims for violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as new allegations concerning events that took place in March 2008. All of the above-described actions filed in federal courts were ordered transferred and joined for pre-trial purposes before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Motions to dismiss have been filed in the purported securities class action, the shareholders derivative action and the ERISA action. Bear Stearns Merger Litigation. Seven putative class actions (five that were commenced in New York and two that were commenced in Delaware) were consolidated in New York State Court in Manhattan under the caption In re Bear Stearns Litigation . Bear Stearns, as well as its former directors and certain of its former executive officers, were named as defendants. JPMorgan Chase was also named as a defendant. The actions allege, among other things, that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties and obligations to Bear Stearns shareholders by agreeing to the proposed merger. The Firm was alleged to have aided and abetted the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty; breached its fiduciary duty as controlling shareholder/controlling entity; tortiously interfered with the Bear Stearns shareholders voting rights; and to have been unjustly enriched. Plaintiffs initially sought to enjoin the proposed merger and enjoin the Firm from voting certain shares acquired by the Firm in connection with the proposed merger. The plaintiffs subsequently informed the Court that they were withdrawing that motion, but amended the consolidated complaint to pursue claims, which included a claim for an unspecified amount of compensatory damages. In December 2008, the court granted summary judgment in favor of all the defendants. Plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal. Bear Stearns Hedge Fund Matters . Bear Stearns, certain current or former subsidiaries of Bear Stearns, including Bear Stearns Asset Management, Inc. (BSAM) and Bear Stearns  Co. Inc., and certain current or former Bear Stearns employees are named defendants (collectively the Bear Stearns defendants) in multiple civil actions and arbitrations relating to the failure of the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Master Fund, Ltd. (the High Grade Fund) and the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Master Fund, Ltd. Part I (the Enhanced Leverage Fund) (collectively, the Funds). BSAM served as investment manager for both of the Funds, which were organized such that there were U.S. and Cayman Islands feeder funds that invested substantially all their assets, directly or indirectly, in the Funds. The Funds are in liquidation. There are five civil actions pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to the Funds. Three of these actions involve derivative lawsuits brought on behalf of purchasers of partnership interests in the two U.S. feeder funds. Plaintiffs in these actions allege that the Bear Stearns defendants mismanaged the Funds and made material misrepresentations to and/or withheld information from investors in the funds. These actions seek, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages based on alleged investor losses. A fourth action, brought by the Joint Voluntary Liquidators of the Cayman Islands feeder funds, makes allegations similar to those asserted in the derivative lawsuits related to the U.S. feeder funds, and seeks compensatory and punitive damages. A motion to dismiss or alternatively to stay is pending in one of the derivative suits relating to one of the U.S. feeder funds. In the remaining three cases, motions to dismiss have been granted in part and denied in part, and discovery is ongoing The fifth action was brought by Bank of America and Banc of America Securities LLC (together BofA) alleging breach of contract and fraud in connection with a May 2007 $4 billion securitization, known as a CDO-squared, for which BSAM served as collateral manager. This securitization was composed of certain collateralized debt obligation (CDO) holdings that were purchased by BofA from the High Grade Fund and the Enhanced Leverage Fund. Defendants motion to dismiss in this action was largely denied; an amended complaint was filed; and discovery is ongoing in this case as well. Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin, the portfolio managers for the Funds, were tried on criminal charges of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud brought by the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York. The U.S. Attorneys Office contended, among other things, that Cioffi and Tannin made misrepresentations concerning the Funds performance, prospects and liquidity, as well as their personal investments in the Funds. On November 10, 2009, after a five-week trial, the jury found Cioffi and Tannin not guilty of all charges submitted to the jury. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission is proceeding with its action against Cioffi and Tannin. Municipal Derivatives Investigations and Antitrust Litigation. The Department of Justices Antitrust Division and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been investigating JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns for possible antitrust and securities violations in connection with the bidding or sale of guaranteed investment contracts and derivatives to municipal issuers. Although the principal focus of the investigations to date has been the period 2001 to 2005, the investigations may also include transactions beyond that period. A group of state attorneys general and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have opened investigations into the same underlying conduct. JPMorgan Chase has been cooperating with all of these investigations. The Philadelphia Office of the SEC provided notice to JPMorgan Securities Inc. (JPMSI) that it intends to recommend that the SEC bring civil charges in connection with its investigations. JPMSI has responded to that notice, as well as to a separate notice that that Philadephia Office provided to Bear, Stearns  Co. Inc. Purported class action lawsuits and individual actions (the Municipal Derivatives Actions) have been filed against JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns, as well as numerous other providers and brokers, alleging antitrust violations in the markets for financial instruments related to municipal bond offerings referred to collectively as municipal derivatives. The Municipal Derivatives Actions have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and defendants have moved to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint. The court has stayed discovery pending disposition of the motion to dismiss Certain plaintiffs asserting class and individual claims under federal and California state law declined to join in the consolidated class action complaints and have filed separate complaints, which defendants have also moved to dismiss. On November 4, 2009, JPMSI consented to the entry of an SEC administrative order finding that JPMSI violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 15B(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Rule G-17 in connection with certain Jefferson County, Alabama (the County) bond underwritings and related swap transactions in 2002 and 2003 by failing to disclose in confirmations and official deal documents descriptions of payments that had been made to mostly local Alabama businesses at the direction of representatives of the Jefferson County Commission. JPMSI entered into the settlement with the SEC without admitting or denying the SECs findings Shortly thereafter, the County filed a complaint against the Firm and several other defendants in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama. The suit alleges that the Firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for which it was chosen to underwrite warrants issued by the County and chosen as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the County. In its complaint, Jefferson County alleges that JPMSI concealed these third party payments and that, but for this concealment, the County would not have entered into the transactions. The County further alleges that the transactions increased the risks of its capital structure and that, following the downgrade of certain insurers that insured the warrants, the Countys interest obligations increased and the principal due on a portion of its outstanding warrants was accelerated. The Firm has moved to dismiss the Countys complaint. A putative class action was filed on behalf of sewer ratepayers against the Firm and numerous other defendants, based on substantially the same conduct described above (the Wilson Action). The Firm moved to dismiss the claims for lack of standing. The plaintiff in the Wilson Action recently filed a fifth amended complaint, which the Firm also moved to dismiss for lack of standing. Both motions remain pending. The Alabama Public Schools and College Authority (APSCA) brought a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama claiming that certain interest rate swaption transactions entered into with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (Chase) are void on the grounds that the APSCA purportedly did not have the authority to enter into transactions or, alternatively, are voidable at the APSCAs option because of its alleged inability to issue refunding bonds in relation to the swaption. Following the denial of its motion to dismiss the action, Chase answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim seeking the amounts due under the swaption transactions. Discovery is under way. Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants have filed a series of putativie class action complaints in several federal courts. The complaints allege that VISA and MasterCard, as well as certain other banks and their respective bank holding companies, including Chase Bank USA, N.A., and JPMorgan Chase, conspired to set the price of credit card interchange fees and enacted respective association rules in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and engaged in tying/bundling and exclusive dealing. All cases have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for pretrial proceedings. The amended consolidated class action complaint extended the claims beyond credit to debit cards. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss all claims that predated January 1, 2004. The Court granted the motion to dismiss these claims. Plaintiffs then filed a second amended consolidated class action complaint. The basic theories of the complaint remain the same, and defendants again filed motions to dismiss. The Court has not yet ruled on the motions. Fact discovery has closed, and expert discovery in the case is ongoing. The plaintiffs have filed a motion seeking class certification, and the defendants have opposed that motion. The Court has not yet ruled on the class certification motion. In addition to the consolidated class action complaint, plaintiffs filed supplemental complaints challenging the MasterCard and Visa IPOs (the IPO Complaints). With respect to MasterCard, plaintiffs allege that the offering violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 1 of the Sherman Act and that the offering was a fraudulent conveyance. With respect to the Visa IPO, plaintiffs are challenging the Visa IPO on antitrust theories parallel to those articulated in the MasterCard IPO pleading. Defendants have filed motions to dismiss the IPO Complaints. The Court has not yet ruled on the motions. Mortgage-Backed Securities Litigation. JPMC and affiliates, heritage-Bear and affiliates and heritage WaMu affiliates have been named as defendants in a number of cases relating to various roles they played in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) offerings. These cases are generally purported class action suits, actions by individual purchasers of securities, or actions by insurance companies that guaranteed payments of principal and interest for particular tranches. Although the allegations vary by lawsuit, these cases generally allege that the offering documents for the securitization trusts contained material misrepresentations and omissions, including statements regarding the underwriting standards pursuant to which the underlying mortgage loans were issued, the ratings given to the tranches by rating agencies, and the appraisal standards that were used. Purported class actions are pending against JPMorgan Chase, heritage Bear Stearns, and certain of their current and former employees in the United States District Courts for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York. Heritage Washington Mutual affiliates, WaMu Asset Acceptance Corp. and WaMu Capital Corp.; are defendants in two purported class action cases, pending in the Western District of Washington. In addition to allegations as to mortgage underwriting standards and ratings, plaintiffs in these cases also allege that defendants failed to disclose Washington Mutual Banks alleged coercion of or collusion with appraisal vendors to inflate appraisal valuations of the loans in the pools. Motions to dismiss have been filed in one of the cases. In addition to the purported class actions, JPMC affiliates and several heritage Bear Stearns entities are defendants in actions in state court in Pennsylvania and in state court in Washington brought by the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh and Seattle, respectively. These actions relate to each Federal Home Loan Banks purchases of certificates in MBS offerings. Defendants responses to the complaint brought by the FHLB of Pittsburgh are due on February 26, 2010. Defendants have removed the action brought by the FHLB of Seattle to federal court. EMC Mortgage Corporation (EMC), a subsidiary of JPMC, is a defendant in four pending actions commenced by bond insurers that guaranteed payment on certain classes of MBS offerings sponsored by EMC. Two of the actions, commenced respectively by Ambac Assurance Corporation and Syncora Guarantee, Inc., (Syncora) are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and involve five securitizations sponsored by EMC. The third action was commenced by Syncora, seeking access to certain loan files. The fourth was filed by CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. in state court in Texas, and involves one securitization sponsored by EMC. In each action, Plaintiffs claim the underlying mortgage loans had origination defects that purportedly violate certain representations and warranties given by EMC to plaintiffs and that EMC has breached the relevant agreements between the parties by failing to repurchase allegedly defective mortgage loans. Each action seeks unspecified damages and an order compelling EMC to repurchase those loans. An action is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York brought on behalf of purchasers of certificates issued by various MBS securitizations sponsored by affiliates of IndyMac Bancorp (IndyMac Trusts). JPMSI, along with numerous other underwriters and individuals, is named as a defendant, both in its own capacity and as successor to Bear Stearns  Co. The defendants have moved to dismiss. JPMC and JPMSI are defendants in an action pending in state court in Pennsylvania brought by FHLB-Pittsburgh, relating to its purchase of a certificate issued by one IndyMac Trust. Defendants responses to the complaint are due on February 26, 2010. JPMC, as successor to Bear Stearns, and other underwriters, along with certain individuals, are defendants in an action pending in state court in California brought by MBIA Insurance Corp. (MBIA) relating to certain certificates issued by three IndyMac trusts, as to two of which Bear Stearns was an underwriter, and as to which MBIA provided guaranty insurance policies. MBIA purports to be subrogated to the rights of the certificate holders, and seeks recovery of sums it has paid and will pay pursuant to those policies. Part I A heritage Bear Stearns subsidiary is a defendant in a purported class action that is pending in federal court in New Mexico against a number of financial institutions that served as depositors and/or underwriters for 10 MBS offerings issued by Thornburg Mortgage, a bankrupt mortgage originator. The Firm and certain other heritage entities have been sued in other purported class actions for their roles an underwriter or depositor of third party MBS offerings but, other than the matters described in the above two paragraphs, the Firm is indemnified in these other litigations. Auction-Rate Securities Investigations and Litigation. Beginning in March 2008, several regulatory authorities initiated investigations of a number of industry participants, including the Firm, concerning possible state and federal securities law violations in connection with the sale of auction-rate securities. The market for many such securities had frozen and a significant number of auctions for those securities began to fail in February 2008. The Firm, on behalf of itself and affiliates, agreed to a settlement in principle with the New York Attorney Generals Office which provided, among other things, that the Firm would offer to purchase at par certain auction-rate securities purchased from J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Chase Investment Services Corp. and Bear, Stearns  Co. Inc. by individual investors, charities, and small- to medium-sized businesses. The Firm also agreed to a substantively similar settlement in principle with the Office of Financial Regulation for the State of Florida and the North American Securities Administrator Association (NASAA) Task Force, which agreed to recommend approval of the settlement to all remaining states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Firm finalized the settlement agreements with the New York Attorney Generals Office and the Office of Financial Regulation for the State of Florida. The settlement agreements provide for the payment of penalties totaling $25 million to all states. The Firm is currently in the process of finalizing consent agreements with NASAAs member states. Approximately half of these consent agreements have been finalized to date. The Firm is also the subject of a putative securities class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and a number of individual arbitrations and lawsuits in various forums, brought by institutional and individual investors, relating to the Firms sales of auction-rate securities. One action is brought by an issuer of auction-rate securities. The actions generally allege that the Firm and other firms manipulated the market for auction-rate securities by placing bids at auctions that affected these securities clearing rates or otherwise supported the auctions without properly disclosing these activities. Some actions also allege that the Firm misrepresented that auction-rate securities were short-term instruments. Plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint, and defendants responses to the complaint are due on March 3, 2010. Additionally, the Firm was named in two putative antitrust class actions in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which actions allege that the Firm, in collusion with numerous other financial institution defendants, entered into an unlawful conspiracy in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Specifically, the complaints allege that defendants acted collusively to maintain and stabilize the auction-rate securities market and similarly acted collusively in withdrawing their support for the auction-rate securities market in February 2008. On January 26, 2010, the District Court dismissed both actions. The time to file an appeal has not yet expired. City of Milan Litigation and Criminal Investigation. In January 2009, the City of Milan, Italy (the City) issued civil proceedings against (among others) JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (JPMCB) and J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. (JPMSL) (together, JPM) in the District Court of Milan. The proceedings relate to a (a) a bond issue by the City in June 2005 (the Bond) and (b) an associated swap transaction, which was subsequently restructured on a number of occasions between 2005 and 2007 (the Swap). The City seeks damages and/or other remedies against JPM (among others) on the grounds of alleged fraudulent and deceitful acts and alleged breach of advisory obligations by JPM (among others) in connection with the Swap and the Bond, together with related swap transactions with other counterparties. The civil proceedings continue. No trial date has been set. In January 2009, JPMCB also received a notice from the Prosecutor at the Court of Milan placing it and certain current and former JPM personnel under investigation in connection with the above transactions. Since April 2009, JPMCB has been contesting an attachment order obtained by the Prosecutor, purportedly to freeze assets potentially subject to confiscation in the event of a conviction. The original Euro 92 million attachment has been reduced to Euro 44.9 million, and JMPCBs application for a further reduction remains pending. In November 2009, the Prosecutor filed a request to proceed to trial in respect of the above transactions against (a) four current and former JPM personnel and (b) JPMCB for administrative liability under Italian Law 231/2001 in respect of alleged crimes committed by those personnel. The preliminary hearing at which these requests will be determined began in January 2010 and continues, with further hearing dates scheduled. The sanctions that potentially could be imposed under Italian law 231/2001 include monetary penalties and restrictions on conduct of JPMCBs business in the jurisdiction. Washington Mutual Litigations. Subsequent to JPMorgan Chases acquisition from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) of substantially all of the assets and certain specified liabilities of Washington Mutual Bank, Henderson Nevada (Washington Mutual Bank), on September 26, 2008, Washington Mutual Banks parent holding company, Washington Mutual, Inc. (WMI) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, WMI Investment Corp. (together, the Debtors) both commenced voluntary cases under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Bankruptcy Case). In the Bankruptcy Case, the Debtors have asserted rights and interests in certain assets. The assets in dispute include principally the following: (a) approximately $4 billion in securities contributed by WMI to Washington Mutual Bank; (b) the right to tax refunds arising from overpayments attributable to operations of Washington Mutual Bank and its subsidiaries; (c) ownership of and other rights in approximately $4 billion that WMI contends are deposit accounts at Washington Mutual Bank and one of its subsidiaries; and (d) ownership of and rights in various other contracts and other assets (collectively, the Disputed Assets). JPMorgan Chase commenced an adversary proceeding in the Bankruptcy Case against the Debtors and (for interpleader purposes only) the FDIC seeking a declaratory judgment and other relief determining JPMorgan Chases legal title to and beneficial interest in the Disputed Assets. Discovery is underway in the JPMorgan Chase adversary proceeding. The Debtors commenced a separate adversary proceeding in the Bankruptcy Case against JPMorgan Chase, seeking turnover of the same $4 billion in purported deposit funds and recovery for alleged unjust enrichment for failure to turn over the funds. The Debtors have moved for summary judgment in the turnover proceeding. Discovery is under way in the turnover proceeding. In both JPMorgan Chases adversary proceeding and the Debtors turnover proceeding, JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC have argued that the Bankruptcy Court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate certain claims. JPMorgan Chase moved to have the adversary proceedings transferred to United States District Court for the District of Columbia and to withdraw jurisdiction from the Bankruptcy Court to the District Court. That motion is fully briefed. In addition, JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC filed papers with the United States District Court for the District of Delaware appealing the Bankruptcy Courts rulings rejecting the jurisdictional arguments, and that appeal is fully briefed. JPMorgan Chase is also appealing a separate Bankruptcy Court decision holding, in part, that the Bankruptcy Court could proceed with certain matters while the first appeal is pending. Briefing on that appeal is under way. The Debtors submitted claims substantially similar to those submitted in the Bankruptcy Court in the FDIC receivership for, among other things, ownership of certain Disputed Assets, as well as claims challenging the terms of the agreement pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of Washington Mutual Bank were sold by the FDIC to JPMorgan Chase. The FDIC, as receiver, disallowed the Debtors claims and the Debtors filed an action against the FDIC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the FDICs disallowance of the Debtors claims, claiming ownership of the Disputed Assets, and seeking money damages from the FDIC. JPMorgan Chase has intervened in the action. On January 7, 2010, the District Court stayed the action pending developments in the Bankruptcy Court and ordered the parties to submit a joint status report every 120 days. In connection with the stay, the District Court denied WMIs and the FDICs motions to dismiss without prejudice. In addition, the Debtors moved in the Bankruptcy Court to take discovery from JPMorgan Chase purportedly related to a litigation originally filed in the 122nd State District Court of Galveston County, Texas (the Texas Action). JPMorgan Chase opposed the motion, but the Bankruptcy Court ordered that the discovery proceed. Debtors are also seeking related discovery from various third parties, including several government agencies. Plaintiffs in the Texas Action are certain holders of WMI common stock and the debt of WMI and Washington Mutual Bank who have sued JPMorgan Chase for unspecified damages alleging that JPMorgan Chase acquired substantially all of the assets of Washington Mutual Bank from the FDIC at an allegedly too low price. The FDIC intervened in the Texas Action, had it removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, and then the FDIC and JPMorgan Chase moved to have the Texas Action dismissed or transferred. The Court transferred the Texas Action to the District of Columbia. Plaintiffs have moved to have the FDIC dismissed as a party and to remand the action to the state court, or, in the alternative, dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC have moved to have the entire action dismissed. The motions to dismiss are fully briefed. Other proceedings related to Washington Mutuals failure also pending before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia include a lawsuit brought by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company against the FDIC alleging breach of various mortgage securitization agreements and alleged violation of certain representations and warranties given by certain WMI subsidiaries in connection with those securitization agreements. JPMorgan Chase has not been named a party to the Deutsche Bank litigation, but the complaint includes assertions that JPMorgan Chase may have assumed certain liabilities. Securities Lending Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (JPMorgan) has been named as a defendant in four putative class actions asserting ERISA and non-ERISA claims pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York related to the Firms securities lending business. Three of the pending actions relate to losses of plaintiffs money (i.e., cash collateral for securities loan transactions) in medium-term notes of a structured investment vehicle known as Sigma Finance Inc. (Sigma). The fourth action concerns losses of money invested in Lehman Brothers medium-term notes, as well as asset-backed securities offered by nine other issuers. Investment Management Litigation. Four cases have been filed claiming that investment portfolios managed by JPMorgan Investment Management Inc. (JPMIM) were inappropriately invested in securities backed by subprime residential real estate collateral. Plaintiffs claim that JPMIM and related defendants are liable for the loss in market value of these securities. The first case was filed by NM Homes One, Inc. in federal court in New York. The second case, filed by Assured Guaranty (U.K.) in New York state court, was dismissed and Assured has appealed the courts decision. The third case was filed by Ambac Assurance UK Limited in New York state court and JPMIMs motion to dismiss the complaint is pending. The fourth case was filed by CMMF LLP in New York state court in December 2009; the Court granted JPMIMs motion to dismiss the claims, other than claims for breach of contract and misrepresentation. Both CMMF and JPMIM have filed notices of appeal. Enron Litigation. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its officers and directors are involved in several lawsuits arising out of its banking relationships with Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries (Enron). A number of actions and other proceedings against the Firm have been resolved, including a class action lawsuit captioned Newby v. Enron Corp. and adversary proceedings brought by Enrons bankruptcy estate. The remaining Enron-related actions include individual actions by Enron investors, creditors and counterparties. Part I The remaining litigation also includes a suit against JPMorgan Chase alleging, in relevant part, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty based upon the Firms role as Indenture Trustee in connection with an indenture agreement between JPMorgan Chase and Enron. The case has been dismissed, but plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal and their appeal is pending before the New York State Court of Appeals. A putative class action on behalf of JPMorgan Chase employees who participated in the Firms 401(k) plan asserted claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and negligence by JPMorgan Chase, its directors and named officers. Plaintiffs motion for class certification and the Firms motion for judgment on the pleadings are both fully briefed. IPO Allocation Litigation. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its securities subsidiaries were named, along with numerous other firms in the securities industry, as defendants in a large number of putative class action lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging improprieties in connection with the allocation of securities in various public offerings, including some offerings for which a JPMorgan Chase entity served as an underwriter. They also claim violations of securities laws arising from alleged material misstatements and omissions in registration statements and prospectuses for the initial public offerings (IPOs) and alleged market manipulation with respect to aftermarket transactions in the offered securities. Bear, Stearns  Co., Inc. is named as a defendant in a little less than a third of the pending IPO securities cases. Antitrust lawsuits based on similar allegations have been dismissed with prejudice. A settlement was reached in the securities cases, which the District Court approved; the Firms share of the settlement is approximately $62 million. Appeals and a petition for leave to appeal have been filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit seeking reversal of the decision approving the settlement. In addition to the various cases, proceedings and investigations discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or otherwise involved in a number of other legal actions and governmental proceedings arising in connection with their businesses. Additional actions, investigations or proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the cases present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of these pending matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss, fines, penalties or impact related to each pending matter may be. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves, that the outcome of the legal actions, proceedings and investigations currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firms consolidated financial condition. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, actions and investigations, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves currently accrued by the Firm; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chases operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chases income for that period.

Part II ", "5": " ITEM 5: MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES The outstanding shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. For the quarterly high and low prices of JPMorgan Chases common stock for the last two years, see the section entitled Supplementary information  Selected quarterly financial data (unaudited) on page 241. For a comparison of the cumulative total return for JPMorgan Chase common stock with the comparable total return of the SP 500 Index and the SP Financial Index over the five-year period ended December 31, 2009, see Five-year stock performance, on page 39. On February 23, 2009, the Board of Directors reduced the Firms quarterly common stock dividend from $0.38 to $0.05 per share, effective with the dividend paid on April 30, 2009, to shareholders of record on April 6, 2009. The action enabled the Firm to retain approximately $5 billion in common equity during 2009, and was taken to ensure the Firm had sufficient capital strength in the event the very weak economic conditions that existed at the beginning of the year further deteriorated. JPMorgan Chase declared quarterly cash dividends on its common stock in the amount of $0.05 per share for each quarter of 2009 and $0.38 per share for each quarter of 2008. The common dividend payout ratio, based on reported net income, was 9% for 2009, 114% for 2008, and 34% for 2007. For a discussion of restrictions on dividend payments, see Note 23 on pages 222223. At January 31, 2010, there were 231,559 holders of record of JPMorgan Chase common stock. For information regarding securities authorized for issuance under the Firms employee stock-based compensation plans, see Item 12 on page 20. In April 2007, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of the Firms common shares. In connection with the U.S. Treasurys sale of the warrants it received as part of the Capital Purchase Progam, the Board of Directors amended the Firms securities repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of warrants for its stock. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Firm did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. As of December 31, 2009, $6.2 billion of authorized repurchase capacity remained under the repurchase program with respect to repurchases of common stock, and all the authorized repurchase capacity remained with respect to the warrants. For further information regarding the Capital Purchase Program, see Capital Management  Capital Purchase Program on page 83. The authorization to repurchase common stock and warrants will be utilized at managements discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact number of shares and warrants purchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firms capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative potential investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs; and may be suspended at any time. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common stock  for example, during internal trading black-out periods. All purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a predefined plan that is established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublic information. For a discussion of restrictions on stock repurchases, see Note 23 on pages 222223. Stock repurchases under the stock-based incentive plans Participants in the Firms stock-based incentive plans may have shares withheld to cover income taxes. Shares withheld to pay income taxes are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the applicable plan and not under the Firms share repurchase program. Shares repurchased between October 28, 2008, and June 17, 2009, (the date the Series K Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury was redeemed) were repurchased in accordance with an exemption from the Capital Purchase Programs stock repurchase restrictions.

Other factors that could affect the Firms financial condition and operations are discussed in the Forward-looking statements section on page 157. However, factors besides those discussed below, in MDA or elsewhere in this or other reports that JPMorgan Chase filed or furnished with the SEC, also could adversely affect the Firm. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. JPMorgan Chases results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by U.S. and international financial market and economic conditions. JPMorgan Chases businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions, including the liquidity of the global financial markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates and currency and commodities prices;investor sentiment; events that reduce confidence in the financial markets; inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit; the occurrence of natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism; and the health of U.S. or international economies. In the Firms wholesale businesses, the above-mentioned factors can affect transactions involving the Firms underwriting and advisory businesses; the realization of cash returns from its private equity business; the volume of transactions that the Firm executes for its customers and, therefore, the revenue that the Firm receives from commissions and spreads; and the willingness of financial sponsors or other investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the Firm. The Firm generally maintains large positions in the fixed income, currency, commodity and equity markets, and from time to time the Firm may have trading positions that lack pricing transparency or liquidity. The revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors, including the Firms success in effectively hedging its market and other risks, volatility in interest rates and equity, debt and commodities, markets credit spreads, and availability of liquidity in the capital markets, all of which are affected by economic and market conditions. The Firm anticipates that revenue relating to its trading and private equity businesses will continue to experience volatility, which will affect pricing or the ability to realize returns from such investments, and that this could materially adversely affect the Firms earnings. The fees that the Firm earns for managing third-party assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in securities markets could affect the valuations of the third-party assets that the Firm manages or holds in custody, which, in turn, could affect the Firms revenue. Macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the Firms funds or accounts. Moreover, even in the absence of a market downturn, sub-par performance by the Firms investment management businesses could cause outflows of assets under management and, therefore, reduce the fees that the Firm receives. The Firms consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions, including U.S. interest rates; the rate of unemployment; housing prices; the level of consumer confidence; changes in consumer spending; and the number of personal bankruptcies. Any deterioration in these conditions can diminish demand for the products and services of the Firms consumer businesses, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. In addition, adverse economic conditions, such as declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment, could lead to an increase in mortgage, credit card and other loan delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce the Firms earnings. If JPMorgan Chase does not effectively manage its liquidity, its business could suffer. JPMorgan Chases liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses. Some potential conditions that could impair the Firms liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise disrupted, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including, among others, commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities (SPEs) or other entities), difficulty in selling orPart I inability to sell assets, unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, and lack of market or customer confidence in the Firm or financial markets in general. These conditions may be caused by events over which the Firm has little or no control. The widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the Firms cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, credit card receivables and other assets, and there is no assurance that these conditions could not occur in the future. The credit ratings of JPMorgan Chase  Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. are important to maintaining the Firms liquidity. A reduction in their credit ratings could reduce the Firms access to debt markets or materially increase the cost of issuing debt, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted, contractually or otherwise, to do business with or lend to the Firm, thereby curtailing the Firms business operations and reducing its profitability. Reduction in the ratings of certain SPEs or other entities to which the Firm has funding or other commitments could also impair the Firms liquidity where such ratings changes lead, directly or indirectly, to the Firm being required to purchase assets or otherwise provide funding. Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, diverse funding sources, and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. Although the Firm closely monitors and manages factors influencing its credit ratings, there is no assurance that such ratings will not be lowered in the future. Such downgrades may come at times of broader market instability, when the Firms options for responding to events are more limited and general investor confidence is low. As a holding company, JPMorgan Chase  Co. relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and, consequently, its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations. These payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, loans or other payments. Several of JPMorgan Chase  Co.s principal subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy requirements or other regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments. Limitations in the payments that JPMorgan Chase  Co. receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its liquidity position. Some global regulators have proposed legislation or regulations requiring large banks to incorporate a separate subsidiary in every country in which they operate, and to maintain independent capital and liquidity for such subsidiaries. If adopted, these requirements could decrease the Firms ability to manage and increase the risk of its liquidity positions. JPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated industry and the Firms business and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which it is subject, including recently-adopted legislation and regulations. JPMorgan Chase is subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the United States, as well as the applicable laws of eachof the various other jurisdictions outside the United States in which the Firm does business. These laws and regulations affect the way that the Firm does business, may restrict the scope of its existing businesses, limit its ability to expand its product offerings or pursue acquisitions, or make offering its products to clients more expensive. Extensive legislation affecting the financial services industry has recently been adopted in the United States and in other jurisdictions, and regulations are in the process of being implemented. In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was adopted in 2010 and will effect significant structural reforms to the financial services industry. This legislation provides for, among other things: the establishment of a Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection which will have broad authority to regulate the credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services that the Firm offers; the creation of a structure to regulate systemically important financial companies, and provide regulators with the power to require such companies to sell or transfer assets and terminate activities if the regulators determine that the size or scope of activities of the company pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the company or the financial stability of the United States; more comprehensive regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market, including providing for higher capital and margin requirements, the central clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives, and heightened supervision of all over-the-counter derivatives dealers and major market participants, including the Firm; so-called push out provisions that could require the Firm to significantly restructure or restrict its derivatives businesses, change the legal entities through which such businesses are conducted, or limit the Firms ability to manage collateral, margin and other risks; prohibitions on the Firm engaging in certain proprietary trading activities and restricting its ownership of, investment in or sponsorship of, hedge funds and private equity funds; restrictions on the interchange fees that the Firm earns on debit card transactions; and a requirement that bank regulators phase out the treatment of trust preferred capital debt securities as Tier 1 capital for regulatory capital purposes. The European Union (EU) has created a European Systemic Risk Board to monitor financial stability and implemented rules that will increase capital requirements for certain trading instruments or exposures and impose compensation limits on certain employees located in affected countries. In addition, the EU Commission is considering a wide array of other initiatives, including new legislation that will affect derivatives trading, impose surcharges on globally systemically important firms and possibly impose new levies on bank balance sheets. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision announced in December 2010 revisions to its Capital Accord, which will require higher capital ratio requirements for banks, narrow the definition of capital, and introduce short term liquidity and term funding standards, among other things. Also being considered is the imposition of a bank surcharge on institutions that are determined to be globally significant financial institutions. These requirements could increase the Firms funding and operational costs. These and any additional legislative or regulatory actions in the United States or other countries, and any required changes to the Firms business operations resulting from such legislation and regulations, could result in significant loss of revenue, limit the Firms ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging, affect the value of assets that the Firm holds, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, impose additional costs on the Firm, or otherwise adversely affect the Firms businesses. Accordingly, the Firm cannot provide assurance that any such new legislation or regulations would not have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition in the future. If the Firm does not comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to its operations, the Firm may be subject to fines, penalties or material restrictions on its businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred. In recent years, regulatory oversight and enforcement have increased substantially, imposing additional costs and increasing the potential risks associated with the Firms operations. As this regulatory trend continues, it could adversely affect the Firms operations and, in turn, its financial results. The financial condition of JPMorgan Chases customers, clients and counterparties, including other financial institutions, could adversely affect the Firm . If the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more of JPMorgan Chases customers may become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to the Firm which, in turn, could result in a higher level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, or in requirements that the Firm purchase assets from or provide other funding to its clients and counterparties, any of which could adversely affect the Firms financial condition. Moreover, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of the Firms counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry, thereby exacerbating the Firms credit risk exposure, and increasing the losses (including mark-to-market losses) that the Firm could incur in its trading and clearing businesses. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Firm to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client, which can be exacerbated during periods of market illiquidity. During such periods, the Firms credit risk also may be further increased when the collateral held by the Firm cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to the Firm. In addition, disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral significantly increase in times of market stress and illiquidity. Periods of illiquidity, as experienced in 2008 and early 2009, may occur again and could produce losses if the Firm is unable to realize upon collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral. Concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses. JPMorgan Chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. As a result, the Firm regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks. The Firms efforts to diversify or hedge its credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful. In addition, increased concentration within the Firms securities or loan portfolios, or in other positions that the Firm may hold, may occur for reasons outside of the Firms control. Disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the Firms inability to sell, syndicate or realize upon its positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce the Firms positions not only increases the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but also increases the level of risk-weighted assets on the Firms balance sheet, thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs, all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the Firms businesses. JPMorgan Chases framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the Firm. JPMorgan Chases risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the Firm. The Firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which the Firm is subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, legal and fiduciary risk, reputational risk and private equity risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the Firms risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that the Firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified. If the Firms risk management framework proves ineffective, the Firm could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. As the Firms businesses change and grow and the markets in which they operate continue to evolve, the Firms risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. As a result, there is the risk that the credit and market risks associated with new products or new business strategies may not be appropriately identified, monitored or managed. In addition, in a difficult or less liquid market environment, the Firms risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for the Firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants. The Firms products, including loans, leases, lending commitments, derivatives, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale, expose the Firm to credit risk. As one of the nations largest lenders, the Firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties, and the credit quality of the Firms exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings. The Firm establishes reserves for probable credit lossesPart I inherent in its credit exposure (including unfunded lending commitments). The Firm also employs stress testing and other methods to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the Firm in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to the Firms financial results and condition, and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the Firms borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the chance that the Firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the Firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies. JPMorgan Chases trading businesses may expose the Firm to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause the Firm to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a trading instrument such as a derivative. Certain of the Firms derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities, commodities or obligations that the Firm does not own; if the Firm is unable to obtain such securities, commodities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery, this could cause the Firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays, which could damage the Firms reputation and ability to transact future business. In addition, in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis, the Firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, the Firm may be exposed to market and operational losses. In particular, disputes regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivatives contracts could arise, which could force the Firm to incur unexpected costs, including transaction, legal and litigation costs, and impair the Firms ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products. Many of the Firms hedging strategies and other risk management techniques have a basis in historical market behavior, and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on managements subjective judgment. For example, many models used by the Firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements. These sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited the effectiveness of the Firms risk management strategies, causing the Firm to incur losses. The Firm cannot provide assurance that its risk management framework, including the Firms underlying assumptions or strategies, will at all times be accurate and effective. JPMorgan Chases operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary, political, legal and other developments in the United States and around the world. JPMorgan Chases businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities and agencies. The Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the United States and the return earned on those loans and investments. The market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of financial assets that the Firm holds, such as mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). Federal Reserve Board policies also can adversely affect the Firms borrowers and counterparties, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to the Firm. Changes in Federal Reserve Board policies (as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of non-U.S. central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies) are beyond the Firms control and, consequently, the impact of changes in these policies on the Firms activities and results of operations is difficult to predict. The Firms businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and trading in securities of companies worldwide. These risks include, among others, risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, and changes in laws and regulations. Crime, corruption, war or military actions, acts of terrorism and a lack of an established legal and regulatory framework are additional challenges in certain emerging markets. Revenue from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets. Also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can, and has in the past, affected the Firms operations and investments in another country or countries, including the Firms operations in the United States. As a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the Firms business and results of operations. Several of the Firms businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities. These activities can expose the Firm to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputational risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, which could adversely affect the Firms financial condition and results of operations. Further, various countries in which the Firm operates or invests, or in which the Firm may do so in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to that country or region, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, or low or negative growth, among other negative conditions. In 2010, concerns were raised about certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, regarding perceived weaknesses in their economic and fiscalcondition, and how such weaknesses might affect other economies as well as financial institutions, including the Firm, which lent funds to or did business with or in those countries. There is always the chance that economic disruptions in other countries, even in countries in which the Firm does not conduct business or have operations, will adversely affect the Firm. JPMorgan Chases results of operations may be adversely affected by loan repurchase and indemnity obligations. In connection with the sale and securitization of loans (whether with or without recourse), the originator is generally required to make a variety of representations and warranties regarding both the originator and the loans being sold or securitized. JPMorgan Chase and some of its subsidiaries, including those acquired through the Bear Stearns merger and the Washington Mutual transaction, have made such representations and warranties in connection with the sale and securitization of loans, and the Firm will continue to do so when it securitizes loans it has originated. If a loan that does not comply with such representations or warranties is sold or securitized, the Firm may be obligated to repurchase the loan and incur any associated loss directly, or the Firm may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such losses. In 2010, the costs of repurchasing mortgage loans that had been sold to government agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the GSEs) increased substantially, and there is no assurance that such costs could not continue to increase substantially in the future. Accordingly, repurchase or indemnity obligations to the GSEs or to private third-party purchasers could materially and adversely affect the Firms results of operations and earnings in the future. The repurchase liability that the Firm records with respect to its loan repurchase obligations is estimated based on several factors, including the level of current and estimated probable future repurchase demands made by purchasers, the Firms ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchases demands, and the severity of loss upon repurchase or foreclosure. While the Firm believes that its current repurchase liability reserves are adequate, the factors referred to above are subject to change in light of market developments, the economic environment and other circumstances. Accordingly, such reserves may be increased in the future. The Firm also faces litigation related to securitizations, primarily related to securitizations not sold to the GSEs. The Firm separately evaluates its exposure to such litigation in establishing its litigation reserves. While the Firm believes that its current reserves in respect of such litigation matters are adequate, there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future. JPMorgan Chase may incur additional costs and expenses in ensuring that it satisfies requirements relating to mortgage foreclosures. In late September 2010, JPMorgan Chase commenced implementation of a temporary suspension of obtaining mortgage foreclosure judgments in the states and territories that require a judicial foreclosure process. Subsequently, the Firm extended this temporary suspension to foreclosure sales in those states and territories that require a judicial foreclosure process, and to foreclosures and foreclosure sales in the majority of remainingstates where a judicial process is not required, but where an affidavit signed by Firm personnel may have been used as part of the foreclosure process. In mid-October, the Firm also temporarily suspended evictions in the states and territories in which the Firm had suspended foreclosures and foreclosure sales, as well as in certain additional states in which an affidavit signed by Firm personnel may have been used in connection with eviction proceedings. This temporary suspension arose out of questions about affidavits of indebtedness prepared by local foreclosure counsel, signed by Firm employees, and filed or used in mortgage foreclosure proceedings in certain states. Based on the Firms work to date, the Firm believes that the information in those affidavits of indebtedness about the fact of default and amount of indebtedness was materially accurate. However, the underlying review and verification of this information was performed by personnel other than the affiants, or the affidavits may not have been properly notarized. The Firm has since resumed filing new foreclosure actions in most of the states in which the Firm had previously halted such actions, using revised procedures in connection with the execution of the affidavits and other documents that may be used in the foreclosure process, and the Firm intends to resume filing new foreclosure actions in all remaining states. The Firm is also in the process of reviewing pending foreclosure matters to determine whether the remediation of previously filed affidavits or other documents is necessary, and the Firm intends to resume pending foreclosure proceedings as the review, and if necessary, remediation, of each pending matter is completed. The Firm expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its efforts to correct and enhance its mortgage foreclosure procedures. Multiple state and federal officials have announced investigations into the procedures followed by mortgage servicing companies and banks, including JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates, relating to foreclosure and loss mitigation processes. The Firm is cooperating with these investigations, and these investigations could result in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including requiring default servicing or other process changes), or other enforcement actions, as well as significant legal costs in responding to governmental investigations and additional litigation. The Firm cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters or the impact that they could have on the Firms financial results. JPMorgan Chases commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation, potential catastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose the Firm to significant cost and liability. JPMorgan Chase engages in the storage, transportation, marketing or trading of several commodities, including metals, agricultural products, crude oil, oil products, natural gas, electric power, emission credits, coal, freight, and related products and indices. The Firm is also engaged in power generation and has invested in companies engaged in wind energy and in sourcing, developing and trading emission reduction credits. As a result of all of these activities, the Firm is subject to extensive and evolving energy, commodities, environmental, and other governmental laws and regulations. The Firm expects laws and regulations affecting its commodities activities to expand in scope and complexity, and to restrict some of the Firms activities, which could result in lower revenues from the Firms commoditiesPart I activities. In addition, the Firm may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations, and the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. Furthermore, liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations for remediation of contaminations. The Firms commodities activities also further expose the Firm to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events, including natural disasters, leaks, spills, explosions, release of toxic substances, fires, accidents on land and at sea, wars, and terrorist attacks that could result in personal injuries, loss of life, property damage, damage to the Firms reputation and suspension of operations. The Firms commodities activities are also subject to disruptions, many of which are outside of the Firms control, from the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment, transmission lines or other equipment or processes, and the contractual failure of performance by third-party suppliers or service providers, including the failure to obtain and deliver raw materials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities. The Firms actions to mitigate its risks related to the above-mentioned considerations may not prove adequate to address every contingency. In addition, insurance covering some of these risks may not be available, and the proceeds, if any, from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents. As a result, the Firms financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by such events. Damage to JPMorgan Chases reputation could damage its businesses. Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to the Firms ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. Damage to the Firms reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the Firms business and prospects. Harm to the Firms reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. In addition, a failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to reputation for the Firm. Adverse publicity regarding the Firm, whether or not true, may result in harm to the Firms prospects. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the Firms reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis, including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions, has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole. Should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the Firms reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the Firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm could not adversely affect the Firms earnings and results of operations. Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the Firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations andinterests with and among the Firms clients. The failure to adequately address, or the perceived failure to adequately address, conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the Firm, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions, as well as cause serious reputational harm to the Firm. JPMorgan Chase relies on its systems, employees and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect the Firms operations. JPMorgan Chases businesses are dependent on the Firms ability to process, record and monitor a large number of complex transactions. If the Firms financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Firm could be materially adversely affected. The Firm is similarly dependent on its employees. The Firm could be materially adversely affected if one of its employees causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the Firms operations or systems. Third parties with which the Firm does business could also be sources of operational risk to the Firm, including relating to breakdowns or failures of such parties own systems or employees. Any of these occurrences could diminish the Firms ability to operate one or more of its businesses, or result in potential liability to clients, increased operating expenses, higher litigation costs (including fines and sanctions), reputational damage, regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing, any of which could materially adversely affect the Firm. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the Firms possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Firm could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of the Firms systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. The Firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the Firms control, which may include, for example, computer viruses, electrical or telecommunications outages, failures of computer servers or other damage to the Firms property or assets; natural disasters; health emergencies or pandemics; or events arising from local or larger scale political events, including terrorist acts. Such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to the Firm. In a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time, and there is no assurance that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls may not occur in the future. As processes are changed, or new products and services are introduced, the Firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. In addition, there is the risk that the Firms controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems could prove to be inadequate. Any such failure could adversely affect the Firms business and results of operations byrequiring the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as by exposing the Firm to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance. JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the Firm. JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties, as well as investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies. Actions brought against the Firm may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Firm, which could materially adversely affect the Firms business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to the Firm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that the Firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny and investigations related to its businesses and operations. The financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chases inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations. JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment and the Firm expects competitive conditions to continue to intensify as continued consolidation in the financial services industry produces larger, better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and Internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading. The Firms businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firms products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the Firms products and services or may cause the Firm to lose market share. Increased competition also may require the Firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses in order to remain competitive. These investments may increase expense or may require the Firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger, more competitive transactions. The Firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect its future results of operations. JPMorgan Chases acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses may not result in all of the benefits anticipated. JPMorgan Chase has in the past and may in the future seek to expand its business by acquiring other businesses. There can be no assurance that the Firms acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results, including results relating to: the total cost of integration; the time required to complete the integration; the amount of longer-term cost savings; the overall performance of the combined entity; or an improved price for JPMorgan Chase  Co.s common stock. Integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect the Firms operations or results. The Firm cannot provide assurance that any integration efforts in connection with acquisitions already consummated or any new acquisitions would not result in the occurrence of unanticipated costs or losses. Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause the Firm to lose customers or cause customers to move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of the Firms ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect the Firms ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and other business partners. The loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect the Firms ability to successfully conduct its business. JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business, and failure to do so may materially adversely affect the Firms performance. JPMorgan Chases employees are the Firms most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The imposition on the Firm or its employees of certain existing and proposed restrictions or taxes on executive compensation may adversely affect the Firms ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees. If the Firm is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, the Firms performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. JPMorgan Chases financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future. Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, JPMorgan Chase is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, mortgage repurchase liability and reserves related to litigations, among other items. Certain of the Firms financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, available-for-sale securities, certain loans, MSRs, private equity investments, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Firms financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, as they are based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loansPart I and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Firms financial statements are incorrect, the Firm may experience material losses.", "1B": " ITEM 1B: UNRESOLVED SEC STAFF COMMENTS None. ", "2": " ITEM 2: PROPERTIES JPMorgan Chases headquarters is located in New York City at 270 Park Avenue, a 50-story office building owned by JPMorgan Chase. This location contains approximately 1.3 million square feet of space. The building is currently undergoing a major renovation. The design seeks to attain the highest sustainability rating for renovations of existing buildings under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System. The total renovation is expected to be substantially completed in 2011. In connection with the Bear Stearns merger in 2008, JPMorgan Chase acquired 383 Madison Avenue in New York City, a 45-story, 1.1 million square-foot office building on land which is subject to a ground lease through 2096. This building serves as the U.S. headquarters of JPMorgan Chases Investment Bank. For further discussion, see Building purchase commitments in Note 30, on page 278. In total, JPMorgan Chase owned or leased approximately 12.4 million square feet of commercial office space and retail space in New York City at December 31, 2010. JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries also own or lease significant administrative and operational facilities in Chicago, Illinois (3.8 million square feet); Houston and Dallas, Texas (3.7 million square feet); Columbus, Ohio (2.7 million square feet); Phoenix, Arizona (1.4 million square feet); Jersey City, New Jersey (1.1 million square feet); and 5,268 retail branches in 23 states. At December 31, 2010, the Firm occupied approximately 68.2 million total square feet of space in the United States. At December 31, 2010, the Firm also managed and occupied approximately 5.6 million total square feet of space in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In the United Kingdom, at December 31, 2010, JPMorgan Chase owned or leased approximately 4.7 million square feet of office space and owned a 424,000 square-foot operations center. In December 2010, JPMorgan Chase acquired a 999-year leasehold interest in 25 Bank Street in Londons Canary Wharf. With 1.0 million square feet of space, 25 Bank Street will become the new European headquarters of the Investment Bank in 2012. In addition, JPMorgan Chase agreed to purchase 60 Victoria Embankment in 2011, a 518,000 square-foot office building the Firm has been leasing since 1991. For further discussion, see Building purchase commitments in Note 30, on page 278. In 2008, JPMorgan Chase acquired a 999-year leasehold interest in land at Londons Canary Wharf and entered into a building agreement to develop the site and construct a European headquarters building. However, acquisition of 25 Bank Street allows the Firm toaccelerate by four years the consolidation of its Investment Bank personnel in one location. In December 2010, JPMorgan Chase signed an amended building agreement to allow continued development of the Canary Wharf site for future use. The amended terms extend the building agreement to October 30, 2016.JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries also occupy offices and other administrative and operational facilities in the Asia Pacific region, Latin America and Canada under various types of ownership and leasehold agreements, aggregating approximately 5.3 million total square feet of space at December 31, 2010. JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries lease significant administrative and operational facilities in India (1.8 million square feet) and the Philippines (1.0 million square feet). The properties occupied by JPMorgan Chase are used across all of the Firms business segments and for corporate purposes. JPMorgan Chase continues to evaluate its current and projected space requirements and may determine from time to time that certain of its premises and facilities are no longer necessary for its operations. There is no assurance that the Firm will be able to dispose of any such excess premises or that it will not incur charges in connection with such dispositions. Such disposition costs may be material to the Firms results of operations in a given period. For a discussion of occupancy expense, see the Consolidated Results of Operations discussion on pages 5963. ", "3": " ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS As of December 31, 2010, the Firm and its subsidiaries are defendants or putative defendants in more than 10,000 legal proceedings, in the form of regulatory/government investigations as well as private, civil litigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firms lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel claims or legal theories. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $4.5 billion at December 31, 2010. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Firm is involved, taking into account the Firms best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made. For certain cases, the Firm does not believe that an estimate can currently be made. The Firms estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many of them are currently in preliminary stages), the existence of multiple defendants (including the Firm) in many of such proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims), and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings. Accordingly, the Firms estimate will change fromtime to time, and actual losses may be more than the current estimate. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. The Firm accrues for potential liability arising from such proceedings when it is probable that such liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downwards, as appropriate, based on managements best judgment after consultation with counsel. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of the currently pending matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these pending matters will be or what the eventual loss, fines, penalties or impact related to each pending matter may be. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves, that the legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firms consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves currently accrued by the Firm; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chases operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chases income for that period. For a description of the Firms material legal proceedings, see Note 32 on pages 282289. Part II ", "4": "", "5": " ITEM 5: MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market for registrants common equity The outstanding shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. For the quarterly high and low prices of JPMorgan Chases common stock for the last two years, see the section entitled Supplementary information  Selected quarterly financial data (unaudited) on pages 295296. For a comparison of the cumulative total return for JPMorgan Chase common stock with the comparable total return of the SP 500 Index and the SP Financial Index over the five-year period ended December 31, 2010, see Five-year stock performance, on page 53. On February 23, 2009, the Board of Directors reduced the Firms quarterly common stock dividend from $0.38 to $0.05 per share, effective with the dividend paid on April 30, 2009, to shareholders of record on April 6, 2009. The action enabled the Firm to retain approximately $5.5 billion in common equity in each of 2010 and 2009, and was taken to ensure the Firm had sufficient capital strength in the event the very weak economic conditions that existed at the beginning of 2009 deteriorated further. JPMorgan Chase declared quarterly cash dividends on its common stock in the amount of $0.05 per share for each quarter of 2010 and 2009. The common dividend payout ratio, based on reported net income, was 5% for 2010, 9% for 2009, and 114% for 2008. For a discussion of restrictions on dividend payments, see Note 23 on pages 267268. At January 31, 2011, there were 225,114 holders of record of JPMorgan Chase common stock. For information regarding securities authorized for issuance under the Firms employee stock-based compensation plans, see Item 12 on page 16. Stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program Under the stock repurchase program authorized by the Firms Board of Directors, the Firm is authorized to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of the Firms common stock plus the 88 million warrants sold by the U.S. Treasury in 2009. During 2009, the Firm did not repurchase any shares of its common stock or warrants. In the second quarter of 2010, the Firm resumed common stock repurchases, and during the year repurchased an aggregate of 78 million shares for $3.0 billion at an average price per share of $38.49. The Firms share repurchase activities in 2010 were intended to offset sharecount increases resulting from employee stock-based incentive awards and were consistent with the Firms goal of maintaining an appropriate sharecount. The Firm did not repurchase any of the warrants during 2010. As of December 31, 2010, $3.2 billion of authorized repurchase capacity remained with respect to the common stock, and all of the authorized repurchase capacity remained with respect to the warrants. The Firm may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate the repurchase of common stock and warrants in accordance with the repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common stock  for example during internal trading black-out periods. All purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a predefined plan established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublic information. The authorization to repurchase common stock and warrants will be utilized at managements discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact number of shares and warrants purchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firms capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative potential investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets orPart II timetables; may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of Rule 10b5-1 programs; and may be suspended at any time.For a discussion of restrictions on stock repurchases, see Note 23 on pages 267268. ##TABLE_START                        Dollar value            of remaining            authorized  Year ended  Total shares   Average price   repurchase  December 31, 2010  repurchased   paid per share (a)   (in millions) (b)   First quarter      $    $ 6,221   Second quarter   3,491,900    38.73    6,085   Third quarter   56,517,833    38.52    3,908   October  17,300,020    38.40    3,244  November  589,800    37.40    3,222  December          3,222   Fourth quarter   17,889,820    38.37    3,222   Total for 2010   77,899,553   $ 38.49   $ 3,222   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (a)  Excludes commissions cost.

", "9A": " ITEM 9A: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firms management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies  or even material weaknesses  in internal controls in the future. See page 158 for Managements report on internal control over financial reporting. There was no change in the Firms internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2010 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firms internal control over financial reporting.

Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Regulatory Risk JPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated industry, and the Firms businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which it is subject. As a global financial services firm, JPMorgan Chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under state and federal laws in the United States and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the United States in which the Firm does business. These laws and regulations significantly affect the way that the Firm does business, and can restrict the scope of its existing businesses and limit its ability to expand its product offerings or to pursue acquisitions, or can make its products and services more expensive for clients and customers. The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Firms businesses, operations and earnings remains uncertain because of the extensive rule-making still to be completed. The Dodd-Frank Act,  enacted in 2010, significantly increases the regulation of the financial services industry. For further information, see Supervision and regulation on pages 17. The U.S. Department of the Treasury, the FSOC, the SEC, the CFTC, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the CFPB and the FDIC are engaged in extensive rule-making mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, and much of the rule-making remains to be done. As a result, the complete impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Firm remains uncertain. Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and such rule-making are discussed in more detail below. Debit interchange . The Firm believes that, as a result of the Durbin Amendment, its annualized net income may be reduced by approximately $600 million per year. Although the Firm continues to consider various actions that it may take to mitigate this anticipated reduction in net income, it is unlikely that any such actions would wholly offset such reduction. Volcker Rule. Until the final regulations under the Volcker Rule are adopted, the precise definition of prohibited proprietary trading, the scope of any exceptions for market making and hedging, and the scope of permitted hedge fund and private equity fund activities remains uncertain. It is unclear under the proposed rules whether some portion of the Firms market-making and risk mitigation activities, as currently conducted, will be required to be curtailed or will be otherwise adversely affected. In addition, the rules, if enacted as proposed, would prohibit certain securitization structures and would bar U.S. banking entities from sponsoring or investing in certain non-U.S. funds. Also, with respect to certain of the Firms investments in illiquid private equity funds, should regulators not exercise their authority to permit the Firm to hold such investments beyond the minimum statutory divestment period, the Firm could incur substantial losses when it disposes of such investments, as it may be forced to sell such investments at a substantial discount in the secondary market as a result of both the constrained timing of such sales and the possibility that other financial institutions are likewise liquidating their investments at the same time. Derivatives. In addition to imposing comprehensive regulation on the Firms derivatives businesses, the Dodd-Frank Act also requires banking entities, such as JPMorgan Chase, to significantly restructure their derivatives businesses, including changing the legal entities through which such businesses are conducted. Further, the proposed margin rules for uncleared swaps may apply extraterritorially to U.S. firms doing business with clients outside of the United States. Clients of non-U.S. firms doing business outside the United States would not be required to post margin in similar transactions. If these margin rules become final as currently drafted, JPMorgan Chase could be at a significant competitive disadvantage to its non-U.S. competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on the earnings and profitability of the Firms wholesale businesses. Heightened prudential standards for systemically important financial institutions. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, JPMorgan Chase is considered a systemically important financial institution and is subject to the heightened standards and supervision prescribed by the Act. If the proposed rules that were issued on December 20, 2011 are adopted as currently proposed, they are likely to increase the Firms operational, compliance and risk management costs, and could have an adverse effect on the Firms business, results of operations or financial condition. CFPB. Although the Firm is unable to predict what specific measures the CFPB may take in applying its regulatory mandate, any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the CFPB may promulgate could require changes in JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I and result in increased compliance costs and impair the profitability of such businesses. In addition, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Acts potential expansion of the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation, the Firm could potentially be subject to additional state lawsuits and enforcement actions, thereby further increasing its legal and compliance costs. Resolution and Recovery. The FDIC and the Federal Reserve have issued a final rule that will require the Firm to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the FSOC a resolution plan under the Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress or failure (a resolution plan). In 2012, the FDIC also issued a final rule that will require the Firm to submit periodic contingency plans to the FDIC under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act outlining its resolution plan in the event of its failure. The Firms initial resolution plan submissions are due on July 1, 2012, with annual updates thereafter, and the Firm is in the process of developing its resolution plans. If the FDIC and the Federal Reserve determine that the Firms resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the Bankruptcy Code, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on the growth, activities or operations of the Firm, or require the Firm to restructure, reorganize or divest certain assets or operations in order to facilitate an orderly resolution. Any such measures, particularly those aimed at the disaggregation of the Firm, may increase the Firms systems, technology and managerial costs, reduce the Firms capital, lessen efficiencies and economies of scale and potentially impede the Firms business strategies. Elimination of Use of External Credit Ratings. In December 2011, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC issued proposed rules for risk-based capital guidelines which would eliminate the use of external credit ratings for the calculation of risk-weighted assets. If the rules become final as currently proposed, they would result in a significant increase in the calculation of the Firms risk-weighted assets, which could require the Firm to hold more capital, increase its cost of doing business and place the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to non-U.S. competitors. Concentration Limits. The Dodd-Frank Act restricts acquisitions by financial companies if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies. The Federal Reserve is expected to issue rules related to these provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2012. This concentration limit could restrict the Firms ability to make acquisitions in the future, thereby adversely affecting its growth prospects. The total impact of the Dodd-Frank Act cannot be fully assessed without taking into consideration how non-U.S. policymakers and regulators will respond to the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing regulations under the Act, and how the cumulative effects of both U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations will affect the businesses and operations of the Firm. Additional legislative or regulatory actions in the United States, the EU or in other countries could result in a significant loss of revenue for the Firm, limit the Firms ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging, affect the value of assets that the Firm holds, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, impose additional costs on the Firm, or otherwise adversely affect the Firms businesses. Accordingly, any such new or additional legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on the Firms business, results of operations or financial condition. The Basel III capital standards will impose additional capital, liquidity and other requirements on the Firm that could decrease its competitiveness and profitability. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) announced in December 2010 revisions to its Capital Accord (commonly referred to as Basel III), which will require higher capital ratio requirements for banks, narrow the definition of capital, expand the definition of risk-weighted assets, and introduce short-term liquidity and term funding standards, among other things. Capital Surcharge. In June 2011, the Basel Committee and the FSB proposed that GSIBs be required to maintain additional capital above the Basel III Tier 1 common equity minimum. See page 2 in Item 1: Business for further information on the proposed capital change. Based on the Firms current understanding of these new capital requirements, the Firm expects that it will be in compliance with all of the standards to which it will be subject as they become effective. However, compliance with these capital standards may adversely affect the Firms operational costs, reduce its return on equity, or cause the Firm to alter the types of products it offers to its customers and clients, thereby causing the Firms products to become less attractive or placing the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to financial institutions, both within and outside the United States, that are not subject to the same capital surcharge. Liquidity Coverage and Net Stable Funding Ratios. The Basel Committee has also proposed two new measures of liquidity risk: the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio, which are intended to measure, over different time spans, the amount of the liquid assets held by the Firm. If the ratios are finalized as currently proposed, the Firm may need, in order to be in compliance with such ratios, to incur additional costs to raise liquidity from sources that are more expensive than its current funding sources and may need to take certain mitigating actions, such as ceasing to offer certain products to its customers and clients or charging higher fees for extending certain lines of credit. Accordingly, compliance with these liquidity coverage standards could adversely affect the Firms funding costs or reduce its profitability in the future. ##TABLE_START 8   ##TABLE_ENDNon-U.S. regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the United States, which could create increased compliance and other costs and adversely affect the Firms businesses, operations or financial conditions. The EU has created a European Systemic Risk Board to monitor financial stability, and the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (G-20) broadened the membership and scope of the Financial Stability Forum in 2008 to form the FSB. These institutions, which are charged with developing ways to promote cross-border financial stability, are considering various proposals to address risks associated with global financial institutions. Some of the initiatives adopted include increased capital requirements for certain trading instruments or exposures and compensation limits on certain employees located in affected countries. In the U.K., regulators have increased liquidity requirements for local financial institutions, including regulated U.K. subsidiaries of non-U.K. bank holding companies and branches of non-U.K. banks located in the U.K.; adopted a Bank Tax Levy that applies to balance sheets of branches and subsidiaries of non-U.K. banks; and proposed the creation of resolution and recovery plans by U.K. regulated entities, among other initiatives. The regulatory schemes and requirements that are being proposed by various regulators around the world may be inconsistent or conflict with regulations to which the Firm is subject in the United States (as well as in other parts of the world), thereby subjecting the Firm to higher compliance and legal costs, as well as the possibility of higher operational, capital and liquidity costs, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Firms business, results of operations and profitability in the future. Expanded regulatory oversight of JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses will increase the Firms compliance costs and risks and may negatively affect the profitability of such businesses. JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to its compliance under consumer laws and regulations, including changes implemented as a part of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Firm has entered into Consent Orders with banking regulators relating to its residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities. The Consent Orders require significant changes to the Firms servicing and default business; the submission and implementation of a comprehensive action plan setting forth the steps necessary to ensure the Firms residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities are conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Consent Orders; and other remedial actions that the Firm has undertaken to ensure that it satisfies all requirements of the Consent Orders. The Firm also agreed in February 2012 to a settlement in principle with a number of federal and state government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the CFPB and the State Attorneys General, relating to the servicing and origination of mortgages. This global settlement requires the Firm to make cash payments and provide certain refinancing and other borrower relief, as well as to adhere to certain enhanced mortgage servicing standards. For further information, see Subsequent events in Note 2 on page 184, and Mortgage Foreclosure Investigations and Litigation in Note 31 on pages 295296. In addition, any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the CFPB may promulgate could require changes in the product offerings and practices of JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. Finally, as a result of increasing federal and state scrutiny of the Firms consumer practices, the Firm may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions and litigation in the future, thereby increasing its costs associated with responding to or defending such actions. In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting the Firms consumer businesses, and any required changes to the Firms business operations resulting from these developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, limit the products or services the Firm offers, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, impose additional compliance costs on the Firm, cause harm to the Firms reputation or otherwise adversely affect the Firms consumer businesses. In addition, if the Firm does not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to its consumer operations, the Firm may be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, or material regulatory restrictions on its businesses, which could adversely affect the Firms operations and, in turn, its financial results. Market Risk JPMorgan Chases results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by U.S. and international financial market and economic conditions. JPMorgan Chases businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions, including the liquidity of the global financial markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates and currency and commodities prices; investor sentiment; events that reduce confidence in the financial markets; inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit; the occurrence of natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism; and the health of U.S. or international economies. In the Firms wholesale businesses, the above-mentioned factors can affect transactions involving the Firms underwriting and advisory businesses; the realization of cash returns from its private equity business; the volume of transactions that the Firm executes for its customers and, therefore, the revenue that the Firm receives from commissions and spreads; and the willingness of financial sponsors or other investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the Firm. ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I The Firm generally maintains extensive positions in the fixed income, currency, commodities and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients. From time to time the Firm may have market-making positions that lack pricing transparency or liquidity. The revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors, including the Firms success in effectively hedging its market and other risks, volatility in interest rates and equity, debt and commodities markets, credit spreads, and availability of liquidity in the capital markets, all of which are affected by economic and market conditions. The Firm anticipates that revenue relating to its market-making and private equity businesses will continue to experience volatility, which will affect pricing or the ability to realize returns from such activities, and that this could materially adversely affect the Firms earnings. The fees that the Firm earns for managing third-party assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in securities markets could affect the valuations of the third-party assets that the Firm manages or holds in custody, which, in turn, could affect the Firms revenue. Macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the Firms funds or accounts. Changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the Firms balance sheet and the revenue the Firm earns from net interest income. A low interest rate environment or a flat or inverted yield curve may adversely affect certain of the Firms businesses by compressing net interest margins, reducing the amounts the Firm earns on its investment securities portfolio, or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights (MSR) asset, thereby reducing the Firms net interest income and other revenues. The Firms consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions, including U.S. interest rates; the rate of unemployment; housing prices; the level of consumer confidence; changes in consumer spending; and the number of personal bankruptcies. Any further deterioration in current economic conditions, or the failure of the economy to rebound in the near term, could diminish demand for the products and services of the Firms consumer businesses, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. In addition, adverse economic conditions, such as continuing declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment, could lead to an increase in mortgage, credit card and other loan delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce the Firms earnings. Widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the Firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis. Credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to Firm-specific events and circumstances, but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in the Firms credit spreads will impact, positively or negatively, the Firms earnings on liabilities that are recorded at fair value. The outcome of the EU sovereign debt crisis could have adverse effects on the Firms businesses, operations and earnings. Despite various assistance packages and facilities for Greece, Ireland and Portugal, it is not possible to predict how markets will react if one or more of these countries were to default, and such a default, if it were to occur, could lead to market contagion in other Eurozone countries and thereby adversely affect the market value of securities and other obligations held by the Firms IB, AM, TSS and CIO businesses. In addition, the departure of any Eurozone country from the Euro could lead to serious foreign exchange, operational and settlement disruptions, which, in turn, may have a negative impact on the Firms operations and businesses. Credit Risk The financial condition of JPMorgan Chases customers, clients and counterparties, including other financial institutions, could adversely affect the Firm. If the current economic environment were to deteriorate further, or not rebound in the near term, more of JPMorgan Chases customers may become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to the Firm which, in turn, could result in a higher level of charge-offs and provisions for credit losses, or in requirements that the Firm purchase assets from or provide other funding to its clients and counterparties, any of which could adversely affect the Firms financial condition. Moreover, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of the Firms counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry, thereby exacerbating the Firms credit risk exposure, and increasing the losses (including mark-to-market losses) that the Firm could incur in its market-making and clearing businesses. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of market-making, trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Firm to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client. The Firm is a market leader in providing clearing, custodial and prime brokerage services for financial services companies. When such a client of the Firm becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the Firm may become entangled in significant disputes and litigation with the clients bankruptcy estate and other creditors or involved in regulatory investigations, all of which can increase the Firms operational and litigation costs. During periods of market stress or illiquidity, the Firms credit risk also may be further increased when the Firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to the Firm. Further, disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral significantly ##TABLE_START 10   ##TABLE_ENDincrease in times of market stress and illiquidity. Periods of illiquidity, as experienced in 2008 and early 2009, may occur again and could produce losses if the Firm is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral. Concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses. JPMorgan Chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. As a result, the Firm regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks. The Firms efforts to diversify or hedge its credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful. In addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the Firms inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce the Firms positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on the Firms balance sheet, thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs, all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the Firms businesses. Liquidity Risk If JPMorgan Chase does not effectively manage its liquidity, its business could suffer. JPMorgan Chases liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses. Some potential conditions that could impair the Firms liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise experiencing disruption, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including, among others, commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities (SPEs) or other entities), difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets, unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, and lack of market or customer confidence in the Firm or financial markets in general. These conditions may be caused by events over which the Firm has little or no control. The widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the Firms cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, credit card receivables and other assets, and there is no assurance that these conditions could not occur in the future. Bank deposits are a stable and low cost source of funding. If the Firm does not successfully attract deposits (because, for example, competitors raise the interest rates that they are willing to pay to depositors, and accordingly, customers move their deposits elsewhere), the Firm may need to replace such funding with more expensive funding, which would reduce the Firms net interest margin and net interest income. Debt obligations of JPMorgan Chase  Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and certain of their subsidiaries are currently rated by credit rating agencies. These credit ratings are important to maintaining the Firms liquidity. A reduction in these credit ratings could reduce the Firms access to debt markets or materially increase the cost of issuing debt, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted, contractually or otherwise, to do business with or lend to the Firm, thereby curtailing the Firms business operations and reducing its profitability. Reduction in the ratings of certain SPEs or other entities to which the Firm has funding or other commitments could also impair the Firms liquidity where such ratings changes lead, directly or indirectly, to the Firm being required to purchase assets or otherwise provide funding. Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital ratios, leading market shares, strong credit quality and risk management controls, diverse funding sources, and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. Although the Firm closely monitors and manages factors influencing its credit ratings, there is no assurance that such ratings will not be lowered in the future. For example, the rating agencies have indicated they intend to re-evaluate the credit ratings of systemically important financial institutions in light of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that seek to eliminate any implicit government support for such institutions. In addition, several rating agencies have indicated that recent economic and geopolitical trends, including deteriorating sovereign creditworthiness (particularly in the Eurozone), elevated economic uncertainty and higher funding spreads, could lead to downgrades in the credit ratings of many global banks, including the Firm. Any such downgrades from rating agencies, if they affected the Firms credit ratings, may occur at times of broader market instability when the Firms options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low. As a holding company, JPMorgan Chase  Co. relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and, consequently, its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations. These payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, loans or other payments. Several of JPMorgan Chase  Co.s principal subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy requirements or other regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments. Limitations in the payments that JPMorgan Chase  Co. receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its liquidity position. Some global regulators have proposed legislation or regulations requiring large banks to incorporate a separate subsidiary in every country in which they operate, and to maintain independent capital and liquidity for such subsidiaries. If adopted, these requirements could hinder the Firms ability to manage its liquidity efficiently. ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I Legal Risk JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the Firm. JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. There is no assurance that litigation with private parties will not increase in the future, particularly with respect to litigation related to the issuance or underwriting by the Firm of mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Actions currently pending against the Firm may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Firm, which could materially adversely affect the Firms business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to the Firm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that the Firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations. The Firms businesses and operations are also subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations. For example, in January 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice, the New York State Attorney General, the Secretary for Housing and Urban Development and the SEC announced the formation of the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group to investigate those responsible for misconduct contributing to the financial crisis through the pooling and sale of residential MBS. These and other initiatives from state and federal officials may subject the Firm to additional judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause the Firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, or higher operational costs, thereby reducing the Firms revenue. Business and Operational Risks JPMorgan Chases results of operations may be adversely affected by loan repurchase and indemnity obligations. In connection with the sale and securitization of loans (whether with or without recourse), the originator is generally required to make a variety of representations and warranties regarding both the originator and the loans being sold or securitized. JPMorgan Chase and some of its subsidiaries have made such representations and warranties in connection with the sale and securitization of loans, and the Firm will continue to do so when it securitizes loans it has originated. If a loan that does not comply with such representations or warranties is sold or securitized, the Firm may be obligated to repurchase the loan and incur any associated loss directly, or the Firm may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such losses. In 2010 and 2011, the costs of repurchasing mortgage loans that had been sold to U.S. government-sponsored entities (GSEs), such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, continued to be elevated, and there is no assurance that such costs will not continue to be elevated in the future. Accordingly, repurchase or indemnity obligations to the GSEs or to private third-party purchasers could materially and adversely affect the Firms results of operations and earnings in the future. The repurchase liability that the Firm records with respect to its loan repurchase obligations is estimated based on several factors, including the level of current and estimated probable future repurchase demands made by purchasers, the Firms ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchases demands, and the severity of loss upon repurchase or foreclosure. While the Firm believes that its current repurchase liability reserves are adequate, the factors referred to above are subject to change in light of market developments, the economic environment and other circumstances. Accordingly, such reserves may be increased in the future. The Firm also faces litigation related to securitizations, primarily related to securitizations not sold to the GSEs. The Firm separately evaluates its exposure to such litigation in establishing its litigation reserves. While the Firm believes that its current reserves in respect of such litigation matters are adequate, there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future. JPMorgan Chase may incur additional costs and expenses in ensuring that it satisfies requirements relating to mortgage foreclosures. The Firm has, as described above, entered into the Consent Orders with banking regulators relating to its residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities, and agreed to the global settlement with federal and state government agencies relating to the servicing and origination of mortgages. The Firm expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its efforts to enhance its mortgage origination, servicing and foreclosure procedures, including the enhancements required under the Consent Orders and the global settlement. JPMorgan Chases commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation, potential catastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose the Firm to significant cost and liability. JPMorgan Chase engages in the storage, transportation, marketing or trading of several commodities, including metals, agricultural products, crude oil, oil products, natural gas, electric power, emission credits, coal, freight, and related products and indices. The Firm is also engaged in power generation and has invested in companies engaged in wind energy and in sourcing, developing and trading emission reduction credits. As a result of all of these activities, the Firm is subject to extensive and evolving energy, commodities, environmental, and other governmental laws and regulations. The Firm expects laws and regulations affecting its commodities activities to expand in scope and complexity, and to restrict some of the Firms activities, which could result in lower revenues from the Firms commodities activities. In addition, the Firm may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations, and the failure to comply with these ##TABLE_START 12   ##TABLE_ENDlaws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. Furthermore, liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations for remediation of contaminations. The Firms commodities activities also further expose the Firm to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events, including natural disasters, leaks, spills, explosions, release of toxic substances, fires, accidents on land and at sea, wars, and terrorist attacks that could result in personal injuries, loss of life, property damage, damage to the Firms reputation and suspension of operations. The Firms commodities activities are also subject to disruptions, many of which are outside of the Firms control, from the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment, transmission lines or other equipment or processes, and the contractual failure of performance by third-party suppliers or service providers, including the failure to obtain and deliver raw materials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities. The Firms actions to mitigate its risks related to the above-mentioned considerations may not prove adequate to address every contingency. In addition, insurance covering some of these risks may not be available, and the proceeds, if any, from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents. As a result, the Firms financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by such events. JPMorgan Chase relies on its systems, employees and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect the Firms operations. JPMorgan Chases businesses are dependent on the Firms ability to process, record and monitor a large number of complex transactions. If the Firms financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Firm could be materially adversely affected. The Firm is similarly dependent on its employees. The Firm could be materially adversely affected if one or more of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the Firms operations or systems. Third parties with which the Firm does business could also be sources of operational risk to the Firm, including relating to breakdowns or failures of such parties own systems or employees. Any of these occurrences could diminish the Firms ability to operate one or more of its businesses, or result in potential liability to clients, increased operating expenses, higher litigation costs (including fines and sanctions), reputational damage, regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing, any of which could materially adversely affect the Firm. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the Firms possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Firm could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either through the fault of the Firms systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. The Firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the Firms control, which may include, for example, security breaches (as discussed further below); electrical or telecommunications outages; failures of computer servers or other damage to the Firms property or assets; natural disasters; health emergencies or pandemics; or events arising from local or larger scale political events, including terrorist acts. Such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to the Firm. In a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time, and there is no assurance that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls may not occur in the future. As processes are changed, or new products and services are introduced, the Firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. In addition, there is the risk that the Firms controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems could prove to be inadequate. Any such failure could adversely affect the Firms business and results of operations by requiring the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as by exposing the Firm to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance. A breach in the security of JPMorgan Chases systems could disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the Firm. Although JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Firms computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Firm and its customers, there is no assurance that all of the Firms security measures will provide absolute security. JPMorgan Chase and other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. Despite the Firms efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, it is possible that the Firm may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Firm such as persons involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Firms systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Firms data or that of its customers or clients. These risks may increase in the future as the Firm continues to increase its mobile payments and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the Firms systems could cause serious negative consequences for the Firm, including significant disruption of the Firms operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Firm or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Firm and those of its customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Firm or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Firms security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure, and harm to the Firms reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Firm. JPMorgan Chases international growth strategy may be hindered by local political, social and economic factors, and will be subject to additional compliance costs and risks. JPMorgan Chase has expanded, and plans to continue to grow, its international wholesale businesses in Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA), Asia/Pacific and Latin America/Caribbean. As part of its international growth strategy, the Firm seeks to provide a wider range of financial services, including cash management, lending, trade finance and corporate advisory services, to its clients that conduct business in those regions. In furtherance of these initiatives, the Firm is selectively expanding its existing international operations, including through the addition of client-serving bankers and product and sales support personnel. Many of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase intends to grow its wholesale businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the United States and other developed markets in which the Firm operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, or low or negative growth, among other negative conditions, or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment. In addition, these countries have historically been more susceptible to unfavorable political, social or economic developments which have in the past resulted in, and may in the future lead to, social unrest, general strikes and demonstrations, outbreaks of hostilities, overthrow of incumbent governments, terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord, all of which can adversely affect the Firms operations or investments in such countries. Political, social or economic disruption or dislocation in countries or regions in which the Firm seeks to expand its wholesale businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations, and there can be no assurance that the Firm will be able to successfully execute its international growth initiatives. Less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the Firms operations in those countries, including, among others, the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations; uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations; difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive; and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions. Conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the Firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems. In addition, the Firm can also incur higher costs, and face greater compliance risks, in structuring its operations outside the United States to comply with U.S. anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. JPMorgan Chases operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary, political, legal and other developments in the United States and around the world. JPMorgan Chases businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities and agencies. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the United States and the return earned on those loans and investments. Changes in Federal Reserve policies (as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of non-U.S. central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies) are beyond the Firms control and, consequently, the impact of changes in these policies on the Firms activities and results of operations is difficult to predict. ##TABLE_START 14   ##TABLE_ENDThe Firms businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and market-making in securities of companies worldwide. These risks include, among others, risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, and changes in laws and regulations. Crime, corruption, war or military actions, acts of terrorism and a lack of an established legal and regulatory framework are additional challenges in certain emerging markets. Revenue from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets. Also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can, and has in the past, affected the Firms operations and investments in another country or countries, including the Firms operations in the United States. As a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the Firms business and results of operations. Several of the Firms businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities. These activities can expose the Firm to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputational risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, which could adversely affect the Firms financial condition and results of operations. Further, various countries in which the Firm operates or invests, or in which the Firm may do so in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to that country or region, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, or low or negative growth, among other negative conditions. Concerns regarding the fiscal condition of certain countries within the Eurozone continue and there is no assurance such concerns will not lead to market contagion beyond those countries in the Eurozone or beyond the Eurozone. Accordingly, it is possible that economic disruptions in certain countries, even in countries in which the Firm does not conduct business or have operations, will adversely affect the Firm. JPMorgan Chases acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses may not result in all of the benefits anticipated. JPMorgan Chase has in the past and may in the future seek to expand its business by acquiring other businesses. There can be no assurance that the Firms acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results, including results relating to: the total cost of integration; the time required to complete the integration; the amount of longer-term cost savings; the overall performance of the combined entity; or an improved price for JPMorgan Chase  Co.s common stock. Integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect the Firms operations or results. The Firm cannot provide assurance that any such integration efforts would not result in the occurrence of unanticipated costs or losses. Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause the Firm to lose customers or cause customers to move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of the Firms ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect the Firms ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and other business partners. The loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect the Firms ability to successfully conduct its business. Risk Management JPMorgan Chases framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the Firm. JPMorgan Chases risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the Firm. The Firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which the Firm is subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, country risk, private equity risk, operational risk, legal and fiduciary risk, and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the Firms risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that the Firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified. If the Firms risk management framework proves ineffective, the Firm could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. As the Firms businesses change and grow and the markets in which they operate continue to evolve, the Firms risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. As a result, there is the risk that the credit and market risks associated with new products or new business strategies may not be appropriately identified, monitored or managed. In addition, in a difficult or less liquid market environment, the Firms risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for the Firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants. The Firms products, including loans, leases, lending commitments, derivatives, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale, expose the Firm to credit risk. As one of the nations largest lenders, the Firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties, and the credit quality of the Firms exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings. The Firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses that are inherent in its ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I credit exposure (including unfunded lending commitments). The Firm also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the Firm in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to the Firms financial results and condition, and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the Firms borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the chance that the Firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the Firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies. JPMorgan Chases market-making businesses may expose the Firm to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause the Firm to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument such as a derivative. Certain of the Firms derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities, commodities or obligations that the Firm does not own; if the Firm is unable to obtain such securities, commodities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery, this could cause the Firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays, which could damage the Firms reputation and ability to transact future business. In addition, in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis, the Firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, the Firm may be exposed to market and operational losses. In particular, disputes regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts could arise, which could force the Firm to incur unexpected costs, including transaction, legal and litigation costs, and impair the Firms ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products. Many of the Firms hedging strategies and other risk management techniques have a basis in historical market behavior, and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on managements subjective judgment. For example, many models used by the Firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements. These sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited the effectiveness of the Firms risk management strategies, causing the Firm to incur losses. The Firm cannot provide assurance that its risk management framework, including the Firms underlying assumptions or strategies, will at all times be accurate and effective. Other Risks The financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chases inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations. JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment and the Firm expects competitive conditions to continue to intensify as continued consolidation in the financial services industry produces larger, better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and Internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading. The Firms businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firms products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the Firms products and services or may cause the Firm to lose market share. Increased competition also may require the Firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses in order to remain competitive. These investments may increase expense or may require the Firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger, more competitive transactions. The Firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect its future results of operations. Competitors of the Firms non-U.S. wholesale businesses are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. For example, the regulatory objectives underlying several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the prohibition on proprietary trading under the Volcker Rule, margin requirements for certain non-U.S. derivatives transactions and the derivatives push-out rules, have not been embraced by governments and regulatory agencies outside the United States and may not be implemented into law in most countries. The more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to U.S. financial services institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase, can put the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to its non-U.S. competitors, including prohibiting the Firm from engaging in certain transactions, making the Firms pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the Firms cost ##TABLE_START 16   ##TABLE_ENDstructure for providing certain products, all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the Firms wholesale businesses. JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business, and failure to do so may materially adversely affect the Firms performance. JPMorgan Chases employees are the Firms most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The imposition on the Firm or its employees of certain existing and proposed restrictions or taxes on executive compensation may adversely affect the Firms ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees. If the Firm is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, the Firms performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. JPMorgan Chases financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future. Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, JPMorgan Chase is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses, mortgage repurchase liability and reserves related to litigations, among other items. Certain of the Firms financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, available-for-sale securities, certain loans, MSRs, private equity investments, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Firms financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, as they are based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Firms financial statements are incorrect, the Firm may experience material losses. Damage to JPMorgan Chases reputation could damage its businesses. Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to the Firms ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. Damage to the Firms reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the Firms business and prospects. Harm to the Firms reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. In addition, a failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to reputation for the Firm. Adverse publicity regarding the Firm, whether or not true, may result in harm to the Firms prospects. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the Firms reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis, including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions, has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole. Should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the Firms reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the Firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm could not adversely affect the Firms earnings and results of operations. Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the Firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among the Firms clients. The failure to adequately address, or the perceived failure to adequately address, conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the Firm, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions, as well as cause serious reputational harm to the Firm.

", "2": " ITEM 2: PROPERTIES JPMorgan Chase s headquarters is located in New York City at 270 Park Avenue, a 50-story office building owned by JPMorgan Chase . This location contains approximately 1.3 million square feet of space. The building underwent a major renovation that was completed in 2011, achieving a LEED Platinum rating from the U.S. Green Building Council, the highest rating possible. In total, JPMorgan Chase owned or leased approximately 12.1 million square feet of commercial office and retail space in New York City at December 31, 2011 . JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries also own or lease significant administrative and operational facilities in Chicago, Illinois (3.7 million square feet); Houston and Dallas, Texas (3.7 million square feet); Columbus, Ohio (2.8 million square feet); Phoenix, Arizona (1.4 million square feet); Jersey City, New Jersey (1.1 million square feet); and 5,508 retail branches in 23 states. At December 31, 2011 , the Firm occupied approximately 68.9 million total square feet of space in the United States. At December 31, 2011 , the Firm also owned or leased approximately 5.8 million square feet of space in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDParts I and II In the United Kingdom, at December 31, 2011 , JPMorgan Chase owned or leased approximately 4.8 million square feet of office space and owned a 379,000 square-foot operations center. In December 2010, JPMorgan Chase acquired a 999-year leasehold interest at 25 Bank Street in Londons Canary Wharf. With 1.4 million square feet of space, 25 Bank Street will become the new European headquarters of the Investment Bank in 2012. In addition, JPMorgan Chase purchased 60 Victoria Embankment in 2011, a 518,000 square-foot office building the Firm had leased since 1991. In 2008, JPMorgan Chase also acquired a 999-year leasehold interest in land at Londons Canary Wharf and entered into a building agreement to develop the site and construct a European headquarters building. However, acquisition of 25 Bank Street allows the Firm to accelerate consolidation of its Investment Bank personnel to one location by four years. In December 2010, JPMorgan Chase signed an amended building agreement for continued development of the Canary Wharf site for future use. The amended terms extend the building agreement to October 30, 2016. JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries also occupy offices and other administrative and operational facilities in the Asia/Pacific region, Latin America and North America under ownership and leasehold agreements aggregating approximately 6.0 million square feet of space at December 31, 2011 . This includes leases for administrative and operational facilities in India (2.1 million square feet) and the Philippines (1.0 million square feet). The properties occupied by JPMorgan Chase are used across all of the Firms business segments and for corporate purposes. JPMorgan Chase continues to evaluate its current and projected space requirements and may determine from time to time that certain of its premises and facilities are no longer necessary for its operations. There is no assurance that the Firm will be able to dispose of any such excess premises or that it will not incur charges in connection with such dispositions. Such disposition costs may be material to the Firms results of operations in a given period. For a discussion of occupancy expense, see the Consolidated Results of Operations on pages 7175.

For information regarding securities authorized for issuance under the Firms employee stock-based compensation plans, see Item 12 on page 22. Stock repurchases under the common equity repurchase program On March 18, 2011, the Board of Directors approved a $15.0 billion common equity (i.e., common stock and warrants) repurchase program, of which $8.95 billion was authorized for repurchase in 2011. The $15.0 billion repurchase program superseded a $10.0 billion repurchase program approved in 2007. During 2011 and 2010, the Firm repurchased (on a trade-date basis) an aggregate of 240 million and 78 million shares of common stock and warrants, for $8.95 billion and $3.0 billion , at an average price per unit of $37.35 and $38.49 , respectively. The Firm did not repurchase any of the warrants during 2010. The Firm may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common equity  for example, during internal trading black-out periods. All purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a predefined plan established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublic information. ##TABLE_START 18   ##TABLE_ENDThe authorization to repurchase common equity will be utilized at managements discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common equity that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firms capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities.

Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Regulatory Risk JPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated industry, and the Firms businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which it is subject. As a global financial services firm, JPMorgan Chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the United States and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the United States in which the Firm does business. These laws and regulations significantly affect the way that the Firm does business, and can restrict the scope of its existing businesses and limit its ability to expand its product offerings or to pursue acquisitions, or can make its products and services more expensive for clients and customers. The U.S. Department of the Treasury, the FSOC, the SEC, the CFTC, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the CFPB and the FDIC are all engaged in extensive rule-making mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, and a substantial amount of the rule-making remains to be done. As a result, the complete impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Firms business, operations and earnings remains uncertain. Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and such rule-making are discussed in more detail below. For further information, see Supervision and regulation on pages 18 . Debit interchange . The Firm believes that, as a result of the Durbin Amendment provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which limit the amount that the Firm can charge for each debit card transaction, the Firms annualized net income has been reduced by approximately $600 million per year. Although the Firm continues to consider various actions to mitigate this reduction in net income, it is unlikely that any such actions will wholly offset such reduction. Volcker Rule . Until the final regulations under the Volcker Rule are adopted, the precise definition of prohibited proprietary trading, the scope of any exceptions, including those related to market-making and hedging activities, and the scope of permitted hedge fund and private equity fund investments remain uncertain. It is unclear under the proposed rules whether some portion of the Firms market-making-related and risk mitigation activities, as currently conducted, will be required to be curtailed or will be otherwise adversely affected. In addition, the rules, if enacted as proposed, could prohibit the Firms participation and investment in certain securitization structures and could bar the Firm from sponsoring or investing in certain non-U.S. funds. Also, should regulators not exercise their authority to permit the Firm to hold certain investments, including those in illiquid private equity funds, beyond the minimum statutory ##TABLE_START 8   ##TABLE_ENDdivestment period, the Firm could incur substantial losses when it disposes of such investments. The Firm may be forced to sell such investments at a substantial discount in the secondary market as a result of both the constrained timing of such sales and the possibility that other financial institutions are likewise liquidating investments at the same time. Derivatives . In addition to imposing comprehensive regulation on the Firms derivatives businesses, the Dodd-Frank Act also requires banking entities, such as JPMorgan Chase, to significantly restructure their derivatives businesses, including changing the legal entities through which such businesses are conducted. Further, some of the rules for swaps will apply extraterritorially to U.S. firms doing business with clients outside of the United States. Clients of non-U.S. firms doing business outside the United States may not be required to comply with the same rules in similar transactions. This disparity in the application of the different rules could place JPMorgan Chase at a significant competitive disadvantage to its non-U.S. competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on the earnings and profitability of the Firms wholesale businesses. Heightened prudential standards for systemically important financial institutions . Under the Dodd-Frank Act, JPMorgan Chase is considered to be a systemically important financial institution and is subject to heightened prudential standards and supervision. If the proposed rules issued by the Federal Reserve in December 2011 are adopted as currently proposed, they are likely to increase the Firms operational, compliance and risk management costs, and could have an adverse effect on the Firms business, results of operations or financial condition. CFPB . The CFPB has issued final regulations regarding mortgages which will become effective in January 2014 and which will prohibit mortgage servicers from beginning foreclosure proceedings until a mortgage loan is 120 days delinquent, and will impose an ability to repay requirement for residential mortgage loans. Other new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the CFPB may promulgate could require changes in JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses, result in increased compliance costs and impair the profitability of such businesses. In addition, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Acts potential expansion of the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation, the Firm could potentially be subject to additional state lawsuits and enforcement actions, thereby further increasing its legal and compliance costs. Resolution . The FDIC and the Federal Reserve have issued a final rule that requires the Firm to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan under the Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress or failure (a resolution plan). The FDIC also issued a final rule that requires the Firm to submit periodic contingency plans to the FDIC under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act outlining its resolution plan in the event of its failure. The Firms initial resolution plan submissions were filed in July 2012, and updates are due annually. If the FDIC and the Federal Reserve determine that the Firms resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the Bankruptcy Code, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on the Firm, or restrictions on the growth, activities or operations of the Firm, or require the Firm to restructure, reorganize or divest certain assets or operations in order to facilitate an orderly resolution. Any such measures, particularly those aimed at the disaggregation of the Firm, may reduce the Firms capital, adversely affect the Firms operations and profitability, increase the Firms systems, technology and managerial costs, lessen efficiencies and economies of scale and potentially impede the Firms business strategies. In addition, holders of subordinated debt or preferred stock issued by the Firm may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that the Firm enters into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding. Concentration Limits . The Dodd-Frank Act restricts acquisitions by financial companies if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies in the United States. The Federal Reserve is expected to issue rules related to these provisions in 2013. This concentration limit could restrict the Firms ability to make acquisitions in the future, thereby adversely affecting its growth prospects. The total impact of the Dodd-Frank Act cannot be fully assessed without taking into consideration how non-U.S. policymakers and regulators respond to the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing regulations under the Act, and how the cumulative effects of both U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations will affect the businesses and operations of the Firm. Additional legislative or regulatory actions in the United States, as well as in the other countries in which the Firm operates, could result in a significant loss of revenue for the Firm, limit the Firms ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging, affect the value of assets that the Firm holds, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, impose additional costs on the Firm, or otherwise adversely affect the Firms businesses. Accordingly, any such new or additional legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on the Firms business, results of operations or financial condition. Non-U.S. regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the United States, which could create increased compliance and other costs and adversely affect the Firms business, operations or profitability. The EU has created a European Systemic Risk Board to monitor financial stability, and the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (G-20) broadened the membership and scope of the Financial Stability Forum in 2008 to form the FSB. These institutions, which are ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I charged with developing ways to promote cross-border financial stability, are considering various proposals to address risks associated with global financial institutions. Some of the initiatives adopted include increased capital requirements for certain trading instruments or exposures and compensation limits on certain employees located in affected countries. In the U.K., regulators have increased liquidity requirements for local financial institutions, including regulated U.K. subsidiaries of non-U.K. bank holding companies and branches of non-U.K. banks located in the U.K.; adopted a Bank Tax Levy that applies to balance sheets of branches and subsidiaries of non-U.K. banks; proposed that non-U.K. banks either obtain equal treatment for U.K. depositors or subsidiarize in the U.K.; and proposed the creation of resolution and recovery plans by U.K. regulated entities, among other initiatives. In the EU, there is an extensive and complex program of proposed regulatory enhancement which reflects, in part, the EUs commitments to policies of the G-20 together with other plans specific to the EU. This program includes the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) which, among other things, would require central clearing of standardized derivatives and which is likely to be phased in starting in 2013. It also includes the revision of the existing Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) to deliver, among other things, the G20 commitment to on-venue trading of derivatives. Both EMIR and MiFID II include many other regulatory requirements that may have wide-ranging and material effects on the Firms business operations. The EU is also currently considering significant revisions to laws covering: depositary activities; credit rating activities; resolution of banks, investment firms and market infrastructures; anti-money-laundering controls; data security and privacy; and corporate governance in financial firms, together with implementation in the EU of the Basel III capital standards. In addition, the Firm is monitoring any potential implications for its business of developments in relation to both bank structure (in respect of which both the EU itself and a variety of EU Member States unilaterally are considering new rules) and the EUs plans for a single supervisory mechanism for systemic banks under the European Central Bank. For example, the U.K. Independent Commission on Banking (the Vickers Commission) proposed provisions, which are now set forth in draft legislation, that would mandate the separation (or ring-fencing) of deposit-taking activities from securities trading and other analogous activities within banks, subject to certain exemptions. The final legislation is expected to adopt and include the supplemental recommendation of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards (the Tyrie Commission) that such ring-fences should be electrified by the imposition of mandatory forced separation on banking institutions that are deemed to test the limits of the safeguards. It is believed that the Firm will have the benefit of the above-referenced exemptions from the requirement to ring-fence, but this cannot be determined until the criteria are known with certainty. Parallel but distinct draft provisions have been published by the French and German governments which could affect the Firms operations in those countries. It is not possible to determine at the current time how these various proposals will affect the Firms businesses, or how each relate to the European Commissions forthcoming legislative proposals on bank structure arising out of the Report of the High Level Expert Group on Reforming the Structure of the EU Banking Sector (the Liikanen Group). However, as regulatory requirements that are being proposed by these various regulators may be inconsistent or conflict with regulations to which the Firm is subject in the United States (as well as in other parts of the world), the Firm may, if these proposals are adopted, be subjected to higher compliance and legal costs, as well as the possibility of higher operational, capital and liquidity costs, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Firms business, results of operations and profitability in the future. The Basel III capital standards will impose additional capital, liquidity and other requirements on the Firm that could decrease its competitiveness and profitability. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) announced in December 2010 revisions to its Capital Accord; such revisions are commonly referred to as Basel III. Basel III will require higher capital ratio requirements for banks, narrow the definition of capital, expand the definition of risk-weighted assets, and introduce short-term liquidity and term funding standards, among other things. In June 2012, the U.S. federal banking agencies published proposed capital rules to implement Basel III. Capital Surcharge . In June 2011, the Basel Committee and the FSB proposed that GSIBs be required to maintain additional capital above the Basel III Tier 1 common equity minimum. See page 5 in Item 1: Business, for further information on the proposed capital change. Based on the Firms current understanding of these new capital requirements, the Firm expects that it will be in compliance with all of the standards to which it will be subject as they become effective. However, compliance with these capital standards may reduce the Firms return on equity or cause the Firm to alter the types of products it offers to its customers and clients, thereby causing the Firms products to become less attractive or placing the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to financial institutions, both within and outside the United States, that are not subject to the same capital surcharge. Liquidity Coverage and Net Stable Funding Ratios . The Basel Committee has also proposed two new measures of liquidity risk: the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio, which are intended to measure, during an acute stress, over different time spans, the amount of the liquid assets held by the Firm in relation to liquidity required. If the ratios are finalized as currently proposed, the Firm may need to incur additional costs to raise liquidity and to take certain mitigating actions, such as ceasing to ##TABLE_START 10   ##TABLE_ENDoffer certain products to its customers and clients or charging higher fees for extending certain lines of credit, in order to be in compliance with such ratios. Accordingly, compliance with these liquidity coverage standards could adversely affect the Firms funding costs or reduce its profitability in the future. Elimination of Use of External Credit Ratings . The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have issued final rules for risk-based capital guidelines which eliminate the use of external credit ratings for the calculation of risk-weighted assets. This will result in a significant increase in the calculation of the Firms risk-weighted assets, which will require the Firm to hold more capital, increase its cost of doing business and place the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to non-U.S. competitors. Expanded regulatory oversight of JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses will increase the Firms compliance costs and risks and may negatively affect the profitability of such businesses. JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to its compliance with consumer laws and regulations, including changes implemented as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Firm has entered into Consent Orders with its banking regulators relating to its Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies, procedures and controls and with respect to its residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities. The Firm also agreed in 2012 to a global settlement with a number of federal and state government agencies relating to the servicing and origination of mortgages. The mortgage-related Consent Order and global settlement require the Firm to make cash payments and provide certain refinancing and other borrower relief, as well as to adhere to certain enhanced mortgage servicing standards, and the BSA/AML Consent Order will require the Firm to make enhancements to its procedures, make investments in its technology and hire additional personnel, all of which will increase the Firms operational and compliance costs. New regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the CFPB may promulgate could require changes in the product offerings and practices of JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses and affect the profitability of such businesses. Finally, as a result of increasing federal and state scrutiny of the Firms consumer practices, the Firm may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions and litigation, thereby increasing its costs associated with responding to or defending such actions. In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting the Firms consumer businesses, and any required changes to the Firms business operations resulting from these developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, limit the products or services the Firm offers, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, impose additional compliance costs on the Firm, cause harm to the Firms reputation or otherwise adversely affect the Firms consumer businesses. If the Firm does not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to its consumer operations, the Firm may be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, or material regulatory restrictions on its businesses, which could adversely affect the Firms operations and, in turn, its financial results. Implementation of the Firms resolution plan under the U.S. resolution plan rules could materially impair the claims of JPMorgan Chase debt holders. As noted above, in July 2012 JPMorgan Chase submitted to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC its initial plan for resolution of the Firm. The Firms resolution plan includes strategies to resolve the Firm under the Bankruptcy Code, and also recommends to the FDIC and the Federal Reserve the Firms proposed optimal strategy to resolve the Firm under the special resolution procedure provided in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (Title II). The Firms recommendation for its optimal Title II strategy would involve a single point of entry recapitalization model in which the FDIC would use its power to create a bridge entity for JPMorgan Chase, transfer the systemically important and viable parts of the Firms business, principally the stock of JPMorgan Chase  Co.s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries, to the bridge entity, recapitalize those businesses by contributing some or all of such intercompany claims to the capital of such subsidiaries, and by exchanging debt claims against JPMorgan Chase  Co. for equity in the bridge entity. If the Firm were to be resolved under this strategy, no assurance can be given that the value of the stock of the bridge entity distributed to the holders of debt obligations of JPMorgan Chase  Co. would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or part of the principal amount of, and interest on, the debt obligations for which such stock was exchanged. Market Risk JPMorgan Chases results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by U.S. and international financial market and economic conditions. JPMorgan Chases businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions, including the liquidity of the global financial markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates and currency and commodities prices; investor sentiment; events that reduce confidence in the financial markets; inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit; the occurrence of natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism; and the health of U.S. or international economies. In the Firms wholesale businesses, the above-mentioned factors can affect transactions involving the Firms underwriting and advisory businesses; the realization of cash returns from its private equity business; the volume of transactions that the Firm executes for its customers and, ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I therefore, the revenue that the Firm receives from commissions and spreads; and the willingness of financial sponsors or other investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the Firm. The Firm generally maintains extensive positions in the fixed income, currency, commodities and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients. The Firm may have market-making positions that lack pricing transparency or liquidity. The revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors, including the Firms success in effectively hedging its market and other risks, volatility in interest rates and equity, debt and commodities markets, credit spreads, and availability of liquidity in the capital markets, all of which are affected by economic and market conditions. The Firm anticipates that revenue relating to its market-making and private equity businesses will continue to experience volatility, which will affect pricing or the ability to realize returns from such activities, and that this could materially adversely affect the Firms earnings. The fees that the Firm earns for managing third-party assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in securities markets could affect the valuations of the third-party assets that the Firm manages or holds in custody, which, in turn, could affect the Firms revenue. Macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the Firms funds or accounts. Changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the Firms balance sheet and the revenue that the Firm earns from net interest income. A low interest rate environment or a flat or inverted yield curve may adversely affect certain of the Firms businesses by compressing net interest margins, reducing the amounts that the Firm earns on its investment securities portfolio, or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights (MSR) asset, thereby reducing the Firms net interest income and other revenues. The Firms consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions, including U.S. interest rates; the rate of unemployment; housing prices; the level of consumer confidence; changes in consumer spending; and the number of personal bankruptcies. If the current positive trends in the U.S. economy are not sustained, this could diminish demand for the products and services of the Firms consumer businesses, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. In addition, adverse economic conditions, such as declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment, could lead to an increase in mortgage, credit card and other loan delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce the Firms earnings. Widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the Firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis. Credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to Firm-specific events and circumstances, but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in the Firms credit spreads will impact, positively or negatively, the Firms earnings on liabilities that are recorded at fair value. Despite improved financial market conditions, many of the structural issues facing the Eurozone remain and problems could resurface which could have significant adverse effects on JPMorgan Chases business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Notwithstanding improved financial market conditions, many of the structural issues facing the Eurozone remain and problems could resurface which could have significant adverse effects on JPMorgan Chases business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, particularly if they lead to sovereign debt default, significant bank failures or defaults and/or the exit of one or more countries from the European Monetary Union (the EMU). The ECBs Outright Monetary Transaction program continues to underpin an improved risk environment, shifting the focus of the crisis from immediate financing strains to the more structural challenges of fiscal retrenchment and stimulation of GDP growth. However, financial market conditions could materially worsen if, for example, consecutive Eurozone countries were to default on their sovereign debt, significant bank failures or defaults in these countries were to occur, and/or one or more of the members of the Eurozone were to exit the EMU. Yields on government bonds of certain Eurozone countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, have remained volatile, despite various stabilization packages and facilities that have been implemented to assist various distressed Eurozone countries. Concerns have been and continue to be raised as to the financial effectiveness of the assistance measures taken to date and such concerns could intensify. Concerns could also be triggered by political developments, with key elections in Italy and Germany during 2013, and ongoing uncertainty about the tolerance of austerity across the Eurozone. Continued economic turmoil in the Eurozone could lead to a further deterioration of global economic conditions and thereby adversely affect the Firms business and results of operations in Europe and elsewhere. There can be no assurance that the various steps that JPMorgan Chase has taken to protect its businesses, results of operations and financial condition against the results of the Eurozone crisis will be sufficient. Further, the effects of the Eurozone debt crisis could be even more significant if they lead to a partial or complete break-up of the EMU. The partial or full break-up of the EMU would be unprecedented and its impact highly uncertain. The exit of one or more countries from the EMU or the dissolution of the EMU could lead to redenomination of certain obligations of obligors in exiting countries. Any such exit and redenomination would cause significant uncertainty with respect to outstanding obligations of counterparties and debtors in any exiting country, whether sovereign or otherwise, and lead to complex and lengthy disputes and litigation. The resulting uncertainty and ##TABLE_START 12   ##TABLE_ENDmarket stress could also cause, among other things, severe disruption to equity markets, significant increases in bond yields generally, potential failure or default of financial institutions, including those of systemic importance, a significant decrease in global liquidity, a freeze-up of global credit markets and a potential worldwide recession. Any combination of such events could negatively impact JPMorgan Chases businesses, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, one or more EMU exits and currency redenominations could be accompanied by imposition of capital, exchange and similar controls, which could further negatively impact JPMorgan Chases cross-border risk and other aspects of its businesses and its earnings. See Managements Discussion and Analysis - Country Risk Management on pages 170173 for a discussion of the Firms European exposures. Changes are being considered in the method for determining LIBOR and it is not apparent how any such changes could affect the value of LIBOR-linked obligations of JPMorgan Chase, or how such changes could affect the Firms financial condition or results of operations. Beginning in 2008, concerns have been raised about the accuracy of the calculation of the daily London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which is currently overseen by the British Bankers Association (the BBA). The BBA has taken steps to change the process for determining LIBOR by increasing the number of banks surveyed to set LIBOR and to strengthen the oversight of the process. The final report of the Wheatley Review of LIBOR, published in September 2012, set forth recommendations relating to the setting and administration of LIBOR, including the gradual phasing out of certain currencies and maturities. In December 2012 the U.K. government adopted legislation enacting one of those recommendations, making it a criminal offense to attempt to manipulate the setting of benchmark rates. The U.K. government also announced that the U.K. Financial Services Authority (FSA) intends to incorporate the rest of the Wheatley Review recommendations in new regulations relating to the LIBOR process. At the present time it is uncertain the extent of changes, if any, may be required or made by the FSA or other governmental or regulatory authorities in the method for determining LIBOR. Accordingly, at the present time it is not apparent whether or to what extent any such changes would have an adverse impact on the value of any LIBOR-linked debt securities issued by the Firm or any loans, derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit for which the Firm is an obligor, or whether or to what extent any such changes would have an adverse effect on the value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to the Firm, or on the Firms financial condition or results of operations. Credit Risk The financial condition of JPMorgan Chases customers, clients and counterparties, including other financial institutions, could adversely affect the Firm. If the current positive economic trends globally are not sustained, more of JPMorgan Chases customers may become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to the Firm which, in turn, could result in a higher level of charge-offs and provisions for credit losses, or in requirements that the Firm purchase assets from or provide other funding to its clients and counterparties, any of which could adversely affect the Firms financial condition. Moreover, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of the Firms counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry, thereby exacerbating the Firms credit risk exposure, and increasing the losses (including mark-to-market losses) that the Firm could incur in its market-making and clearing businesses. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of market-making, trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Firm to credit risk and, in some cases, disputes and litigation in the event of a default by the counterparty or client. During periods of market stress or illiquidity, the Firms credit risk also may be further increased when the Firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to the Firm. Further, disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral significantly increase in times of market stress and illiquidity. Periods of illiquidity could produce losses if the Firm is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral. Concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses. JPMorgan Chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. As a result, the Firm regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks. The Firms efforts to diversify or hedge its credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful. In addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the Firms inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce the Firms positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but also increase ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I the level of risk-weighted assets on the Firms balance sheet, thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs, all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the Firms businesses. JPMorgan Chases role as a clearing and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase business exposes it to credit risks, including intra-day credit risk. The Firm is a market leader in providing clearing, custodial and prime brokerage services for financial services companies. In addition, the Firm acts as a clearing and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. Many of these transactions expose the Firm to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client and, in the case of its role in the U.S. tri-party repurchase business, can expose the Firm to intra-day credit risk of the cash borrowers, usually broker-dealers; however, this exposure is secured by collateral and typically extinguished through the settlement process by the end of the day. The Firm actively participated in the Tri-Party Repo Infrastructure Reform Task Force sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which issued recommendations to modify and improve the infrastructure of tri-party repurchase transactions in order to, among other things, mitigate intra-day credit exposure. The Firm has implemented many of the recommendations and intends to implement the intra-day credit recommendations by the end of 2013. As a result, the Firm expects its intra-day credit exposure after implementation of all the Task Force recommendations to be substantially reduced. Nevertheless, if a broker-dealer that is party to a repurchase transaction cleared by the Firm becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the Firm may become involved in disputes and litigation with the broker-dealers bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or involved in regulatory investigations, all of which can increase the Firms operational and litigation costs and may result in losses if the securities in the repurchase transaction decline in value. Liquidity Risk If JPMorgan Chase does not effectively manage its liquidity, its business could suffer. JPMorgan Chases liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses. Some potential conditions that could impair the Firms liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise experiencing disruption, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including, among others, commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities (SPEs) or other entities), difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets, unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, and lack of market or customer confidence in the Firm or financial markets in general. These conditions may be caused by events over which the Firm has little or no control. The widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the Firms cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, credit card receivables and other assets, and there is no assurance that these conditions could not occur in the future. If the Firms access to stable and low cost sources of funding, such as bank deposits, are reduced, the Firm may need to raise alternative funding which may be more expensive or of limited availability. As a holding company, JPMorgan Chase  Co. relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and, consequently, its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations. These payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, loans or other payments. Several of JPMorgan Chase  Co.s principal subsidiaries are subject to dividend distribution or capital adequacy requirements or other regulatory restrictions on their ability to provide such payments. Limitations in the payments that JPMorgan Chase  Co. receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its liquidity position. Some regulators have proposed legislation or regulations requiring large banks to incorporate a separate subsidiary in countries in which they operate, and to maintain independent capital and liquidity for such subsidiaries. If adopted, these requirements could hinder the Firms ability to efficiently manage its funding and liquidity in a centralized manner. Reductions in the Firms credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding, as well as the value of debt obligations issued by the Firm. JPMorgan Chase  Co. and certain of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., are currently rated by credit rating agencies. In 2012, Moodys and Fitch downgraded the ratings of JPMorgan Chase  Co. In addition, as of year-end 2012, Moodys had JPMorgan Chase  Co., and SP had JPMorgan Chase  Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and certain other subsidiaries, on negative outlook, indicating the possibility of a further downgrade in ratings. Although the Firm closely monitors and manages factors influencing its credit ratings, there is no assurance that such ratings will not be lowered in the future. For example, the rating agencies, have indicated that further control failures by the Firm (such as was evidenced in the Chief Investment Office (CIO) matter discussed below), deterioration in capital, liquidity and asset quality levels, or a significant increase in risk appetite could put downward pressure on the Firms ratings. Additionally, the rating agencies have indicated that they intend to re-evaluate the credit ratings of systemically important financial institutions in light of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that seek to eliminate any implicit government support for such institutions. Furthermore, the rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, including sovereign creditworthiness, elevated economic uncertainty and higher funding spreads, all of which could lead to downgrades in the credit ratings of global banks, including the Firm. There is no assurance that any such downgrades from rating agencies, if they affected the Firms credit ratings, would not occur at times of broader market instability when the ##TABLE_START 14   ##TABLE_ENDFirms options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low. Further, a reduction in the Firms credit ratings could reduce the Firms access to debt markets, materially increase the cost of issuing debt, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted, contractually or otherwise, to do business with or lend to the Firm, thereby curtailing the Firms business operations and reducing its profitability. In addition, any such reduction in credit ratings may increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase  Co. and its subsidiaries and, as a result, could adversely affect the value of debt obligations that they have issued or may issue in the future. Legal Risk JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the Firm. JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. There is no assurance that litigation with private parties will not increase in the future. Actions currently pending against the Firm may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Firm, which could materially adversely affect the Firms business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to the Firm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that the Firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations. The Firms businesses and operations are also subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. In 2012, the Firm was the subject of Consent Orders from its banking regulators and entered into a global settlement with federal and state governmental agencies relating to its mortgage servicing and origination activities. In January 2013, the Firm also entered into Consent Orders with its banking regulators related to risk management, model governance and other control functions related to CIO and certain other trading activities at the Firm and with respect to the Firms and certain of its bank subsidiaries policies, procedures and controls relating to compliance with BSA and AML requirements. As the regulators continue to examine the operations of the Firm and its bank subsidiaries, there is no assurance that additional consent orders or other enforcement actions will not be issued by them in the future. These and other initiatives from federal and state officials may subject the Firm to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause the Firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, or higher operational costs, thereby reducing the Firms revenue. Business and Operational Risks JPMorgan Chases operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary and political developments in the United States and around the world. JPMorgan Chases businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities and agencies. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the United States and the return earned on those loans and investments. Changes in Federal Reserve policies (as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of non-U.S. central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies) are beyond the Firms control and, consequently, the impact of changes in these policies on the Firms activities and results of operations is difficult to predict. The Firms businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and market-making in securities of companies worldwide. These risks include, among others, risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, in the countries in which such companies operate, as well as the other risks and considerations as described further below. Several of the Firms businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities. These activities can expose the Firm to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputational risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, which could adversely affect the Firms financial condition and results of operations. Further, various countries in which the Firm operates or invests, or in which the Firm may do so in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. As noted above, concerns regarding the fiscal condition of certain countries within the Eurozone continue and there is no assurance such concerns will not lead to market contagion beyond those countries in the Eurozone or beyond the Eurozone. Accordingly, it is possible that economic disruptions in certain countries, even in countries in which the Firm does not conduct business or have operations, will adversely affect the Firm. JPMorgan Chases international growth strategy may be hindered by local political, social and economic factors, and will be subject to additional compliance costs and risks. JPMorgan Chase has expanded, and plans to continue to grow, its international wholesale businesses in Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA), Asia/Pacific and Latin America/Caribbean. As part of its international growth strategy, the Firm seeks to provide a wider range of ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I financial services to its clients that conduct business in those regions and to expand its international operations. Many of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase intends to grow its wholesale businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the United States and other developed markets in which the Firm currently operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, or low or negative growth, among other negative conditions, or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment. In addition, these countries have historically been more susceptible to unfavorable political, social or economic developments which have in the past resulted in, and may in the future lead to, social unrest, general strikes and demonstrations, outbreaks of hostilities, overthrow of incumbent governments, terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord, all of which can adversely affect the Firms operations or investments in such countries. Political, social or economic disruption or dislocation in countries or regions in which the Firm seeks to expand its wholesale businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations, and there can be no assurance that the Firm will be able to successfully execute its international growth initiatives. Less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the Firms operations in those countries, including, among others, the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations; uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations; difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive; and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions. Revenue from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations, as well as due to governmental actions including expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, and changes in laws and regulations. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets. Also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can, and has in the past, affected the Firms operations and investments in another country or countries, including the Firms operations in the United States. As a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the Firms business and results of operations. Conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the Firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. There can be no assurance that the Firm will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems. In addition, the Firm can also incur higher costs, and face greater compliance risks, in structuring its operations outside the United States to comply with U.S. anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. JPMorgan Chases results of operations may be adversely affected by loan repurchase and indemnity obligations. In connection with the sale and securitization of loans (whether with or without recourse), the originator is generally required to make a variety of representations and warranties regarding both the originator and the loans being sold or securitized. JPMorgan Chase and some of its subsidiaries have made such representations and warranties in connection with the sale and securitization of loans, and the Firm will continue to do so when it securitizes loans it has originated. If a loan that does not comply with such representations or warranties is sold or securitized, the Firm may be obligated to repurchase the loan and incur any associated loss directly, or the Firm may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such losses. Since 2010, the costs of repurchasing mortgage loans that had been sold to U.S. government-sponsored entities (GSEs), such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have been elevated, and there is no assurance that such costs will not continue to be elevated in the future. Accordingly, repurchase or indemnity obligations to the GSEs or to private third-party purchasers could materially and adversely affect the Firms results of operations and earnings in the future. The repurchase liability that the Firm records with respect to its loan repurchase obligations to the GSEs is estimated based on several factors, including the level of current and estimated probable future repurchase demands made by purchasers, the Firms ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchases demands, the severity of loss upon repurchase or foreclosure, the Firms potential ability to recover certain losses from third-party originators, and the terms of agreements with certain mortgage insurers and other parties. While the Firm believes that its current repurchase liability reserves are adequate, the factors referred to above are subject to change based on the GSEs future behavior, the economic environment and other uncertainties. Accordingly, there is no assurance that such reserves will not be increased in the future. The Firm also faces litigation related to securitizations, primarily related to securitizations not sold to the GSEs. The ##TABLE_START 16   ##TABLE_ENDFirm separately evaluates its exposure to such litigation in establishing its litigation reserves. While the Firm believes that its current reserves in respect of such litigation matters are adequate, there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future. JPMorgan Chase may incur additional costs and expenses in ensuring that it satisfies requirements relating to mortgage servicing and foreclosures. The Firm has, as described above, entered into the Consent Orders with its banking regulators relating to its residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities, and agreed to the global settlement with federal and state government agencies relating to the servicing and origination of mortgages. The Firm expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its efforts to enhance its mortgage origination, servicing and foreclosure procedures, including the enhancements required under the Consent Orders and the global settlement. In addition, the GSEs impose compensatory fees on their mortgage servicers, including the Firm, if such servicers are unable to comply with the foreclosure timetables mandated by the GSEs, and such fees may continue to be imposed on the Firm in the future. JPMorgan Chases commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation, potential catastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose the Firm to significant cost and liability. JPMorgan Chase engages in the storage, transportation, marketing or trading of several commodities, including metals, agricultural products, crude oil, oil products, natural gas, electric power, emission credits, coal, freight, and related products and indices. The Firm is also engaged in power generation and has invested in companies engaged in wind energy and in sourcing, developing and trading emission reduction credits. As a result of all of these activities, the Firm is subject to extensive and evolving energy, commodities, environmental, and other governmental laws and regulations. The Firm expects laws and regulations affecting its commodities activities to expand in scope and complexity, and to restrict some of the Firms activities, which could result in lower revenues from the Firms commodities activities. In addition, the Firm may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations, and the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. Furthermore, liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations for remediation of contaminations. The Firms commodities activities also further expose the Firm to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events, including natural disasters, leaks, spills, explosions, release of toxic substances, fires, accidents on land and at sea, wars, and terrorist attacks that could result in personal injuries, loss of life, property damage, damage to the Firms reputation and suspension of operations. The Firms commodities activities are also subject to disruptions, many of which are outside of the Firms control, from the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment, transmission lines or other equipment or processes, and the contractual failure of performance by third-party suppliers or service providers, including the failure to obtain and deliver raw materials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities. The Firms actions to mitigate its risks related to the above-mentioned considerations may not prove adequate to address every contingency. In addition, insurance covering some of these risks may not be available, and the proceeds, if any, from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents. As a result, the Firms financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by such events. JPMorgan Chase relies on its systems, employees and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect the Firms operations. JPMorgan Chases businesses are dependent on the Firms ability to process, record and monitor a large number of complex transactions. If the Firms financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Firm could be materially adversely affected. The Firm is similarly dependent on its employees. The Firm could be materially adversely affected if one or more of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the Firms operations or systems. Third parties with which the Firm does business could also be sources of operational risk to the Firm, including with respect to breakdowns or failures of the systems or misconduct by the employees of such parties. In addition, as the Firm changes processes or introduces new products and services, the Firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Any of these occurrences could diminish the Firms ability to operate one or more of its businesses, or result in potential liability to clients, increased operating expenses, higher litigation costs (including fines and sanctions), reputational damage, regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing, any of which could materially adversely affect the Firm. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the Firms possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Firm could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either through the fault of the Firms systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. The Firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the Firms control, which may include, for example, security breaches (as discussed further below); electrical or ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I telecommunications outages; failures of computer servers or other damage to the Firms property or assets; natural disasters; health emergencies or pandemics; or events arising from local or larger scale political events, including terrorist acts. JPMorgan Chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure that the Firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. While the Firm believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate, there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the Firm. Any failures or disruptions of the Firms systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients, adversely affect the Firms business and results of operations by subjecting the Firm to losses or liability, or require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption, as well as by exposing the Firm to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance. A breach in the security of JPMorgan Chases systems could disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the Firm. Although JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Firms computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Firm and its customers, there is no assurance that all of the Firms security measures will provide absolute security. JPMorgan Chase and other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. The Firm and several other U.S. financial institutions have also experienced several significant distributed denial-of-service attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties which were intended to disrupt consumer online banking services. Despite the Firms efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, it is possible that the Firm may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Firm such as persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Firms systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Firms data or that of its customers or clients. These risks may increase in the future as the Firm continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the Firms systems could cause serious negative consequences for the Firm, including significant disruption of the Firms operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Firm or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Firm and those of its customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Firm or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Firms security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure, and harm to the Firms reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Firm. JPMorgan Chases acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses may not result in all of the benefits anticipated. JPMorgan Chase has in the past and may in the future seek to expand its business by acquiring other businesses. There can be no assurance that the Firms acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results, including results relating to: the total cost of integration; the time required to complete the integration; the amount of longer-term cost savings; the overall performance of the combined entity; or an improved price for JPMorgan Chase  Co.s common stock. Integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect the Firms operations or results. The Firm cannot provide assurance that any such integration efforts would not result in the occurrence of unanticipated costs or losses. Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause the Firm to lose customers or cause customers to move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of the Firms ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect the Firms ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and other business partners. The loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect the Firms ability to successfully conduct its business. Risk Management JPMorgan Chases framework for managing risks and its risk management procedures and practices may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the Firm. JPMorgan Chases risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the Firm. The Firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which the Firm is subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market ##TABLE_START 18   ##TABLE_ENDrisk, interest rate risk, country risk, principal risk, operational risk, legal and fiduciary risk, and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the Firms risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that the Firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified. If the Firms risk management framework proves ineffective, the Firm could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. As the Firms businesses change and grow and the markets in which they operate continue to evolve, the Firms risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. As a result, there is the risk that the credit and market risks associated with new products or new business strategies may not be appropriately identified, monitored or managed. In addition, in a difficult or less liquid market environment, the Firms risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for the Firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants. The Firms products, including loans, leases, lending commitments, derivatives, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale, as well as cash management and clearing activities, expose the Firm to credit risk. As one of the nations largest lenders, the Firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties, and the credit quality of the Firms exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings. The Firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses that are inherent in its credit exposure, including unfunded lending commitments. The Firm also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the Firm in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to the Firms financial results and condition, and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the Firms borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the chance that the Firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the Firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies. JPMorgan Chases market-making businesses may expose the Firm to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause the Firm to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument such as a derivative. Certain of the Firms derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities, commodities or obligations that the Firm does not own; if the Firm is unable to obtain such securities, commodities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery, this could cause the Firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays, which could damage the Firms reputation and ability to transact future business. In addition, in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis, the Firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, the Firm may be exposed to market and operational losses. In particular, disputes regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts could arise, which could force the Firm to incur unexpected costs, including transaction, legal and litigation costs, and impair the Firms ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products. Many of the Firms risk management strategies or techniques have a basis in historical market behavior, and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on managements subjective judgment. For example, many models used by the Firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements. These sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited the effectiveness of the Firms risk management strategies, causing the Firm to incur losses. The Firm cannot provide assurance that its risk management framework, including the Firms underlying assumptions or strategies, will at all times be accurate and effective. In connection with the Firms internal review of the reported losses in the synthetic credit portfolio managed by CIO, management concluded that during the first quarter of 2012 CIOs risk management had been ineffective in dealing with the growth in the size and complexity of the portfolio during the first quarter of 2012. Among other matters, the Firms internal review found that CIO lacked a robust risk committee structure; that CIOs risk limits were insufficiently granular and should have been reassessed in light of the positions being added to the synthetic credit portfolio in the first quarter of 2012; that CIO risk management was insufficiently engaged in the approval and implementation during the first quarter of 2012 of a new CIO Value-at-Risk (VaR) model related to the portfolio (before that model was discontinued and the previous model was restored); and that there was inadequate escalation to the Firms management of certain risk issues relating to the portfolio. The Firm has taken steps to correct such lapses, including, among other things, appointing a new Chief Risk Officer for CIO/Treasury/Corporate (CTC); adding resources and talent in CIO risk management; instituting new CTC risk committees to improve governance and controls and ensure tighter linkages between CIO, Treasury and other activities in the Corporate sector; and introducing more granular risk limits for CIO. ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I In January 2013, JPMorgan Chase  Co. entered into a Consent Order with the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. entered into a Consent Order with the OCC relating to the banking regulators reviews of the CIO matter. These Consent Orders relate to risk management, model governance and other control functions related to CIO and certain other trading activities at the Firm. Many of the actions required by the Consent Orders have already been, or are in the process of being, implemented by the Firm. While the Firm has taken, and is taking, steps to correct the lapses in the CIO risk management framework, there is no assurance that new or additional lapses in the Firms risk management framework and governance structure could not occur in the future. Any such lapses or other inadequacies in the design or implementation of the Firms risk management framework, governance, procedures or practices could, individually or in the aggregate, cause unexpected losses for the Firm, materially and adversely affect the Firms financial condition and results of operations, require significant resources to remediate any risk management deficiency, attract heightened regulatory scrutiny, expose the Firm to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings, subject the Firm to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firms reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence. Lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the Firms operations, profitability or reputation. The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Nevertheless, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in disclosure controls and procedures or in the Firms internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time. On July 13, 2012, the Firm reported that it had determined that a material weakness existed in its internal control over financial reporting at March 31, 2012. This determination related to the valuation control function for the synthetic credit portfolio managed by CIO during the first quarter of 2012. As a result of the material weakness, management also concluded that the Firms disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at March 31, 2012. Management has taken steps to remediate the internal control deficiency, including enhancing management supervision of valuation matters. The control deficiency was substantially remediated by June 30, 2012, and was closed-out by September 30, 2012. There can be no assurance that the Firms disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in the future or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting could not occur again. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect the Firms business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose the Firm to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject it to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firms reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence. Other Risks The financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chases inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations. JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment and the Firm expects competitive conditions to continue to intensify as the financial services industry produces better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and Internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading. The Firms businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firms products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the Firms products and services or may cause the Firm to lose market share. Increased competition also may require the Firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses in order to remain competitive. These investments may increase expense or may require the Firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger, more competitive transactions. The Firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect its future results of operations. Competitors of the Firms non-U.S. wholesale businesses are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. For example, the regulatory objectives underlying several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the prohibition on proprietary trading under the Volcker Rule and the derivatives push-out rules, have not been embraced by governments and regulatory agencies outside the United States and may not be implemented into law in most countries. The more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to U.S. financial services institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase, can put the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to its non-U.S. competitors, including ##TABLE_START 20   ##TABLE_ENDprohibiting the Firm from engaging in certain transactions, making the Firms pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the Firms cost structure for providing certain products, all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the Firms wholesale businesses. JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business, and failure to do so may materially adversely affect the Firms performance. JPMorgan Chases employees are the Firms most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The imposition on the Firm or its employees of restrictions on executive compensation may adversely affect the Firms ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees. If the Firm is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, the Firms performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. JPMorgan Chases financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future. Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, JPMorgan Chase is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses, mortgage repurchase liability and reserves related to litigation, among other items. Certain of the Firms financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, available-for-sale securities, certain loans, MSRs, private equity investments, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Firms financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Firms financial statements are incorrect, the Firm may experience material losses. Damage to JPMorgan Chases reputation could damage its businesses. Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to the Firms ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. Damage to the Firms reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the Firms business and prospects. Harm to the Firms reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. In addition, a failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to the Firms reputation. Adverse publicity regarding the Firm, whether or not true, may result in harm to the Firms prospects. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the Firms reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis, including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions, has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole. Should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the Firms reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the Firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm could not adversely affect the Firms earnings and results of operations. Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the Firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among the Firms clients. The failure to adequately address, or the perceived failure to adequately address, conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the Firm, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions, as well as cause serious reputational harm to the Firm.

In 2008, JPMorgan Chase had acquired a 999-year leasehold interest in land at Londons Canary Wharf and had entered into a building agreement to develop the site and construct a European headquarters building. However, with the acquisition of 25 Bank Street, JPMorgan Chase signed an amended building agreement in December 2010 for the continued development of the Canary Wharf site for future use. The amended terms extend the building agreement to October 30, 2016. JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries also occupy offices and other administrative and operational facilities in the Asia/Pacific region, Latin America and North America under ownership and leasehold agreements aggregating approximately 5.4 million square feet of space at December 31, 2012. This includes leases for administrative and operational facilities in India (2.0 million square feet) and the Philippines (1.0 million square feet). The properties occupied by JPMorgan Chase are used across all of the Firms business segments and for corporate purposes. JPMorgan Chase continues to evaluate its current and projected space requirements and may determine from time to time that certain of its premises and facilities are no longer necessary for its operations. There is no assurance that the Firm will be able to dispose of any such excess premises or that it will not incur charges in connection with such dispositions.

Repurchases under the common equity repurchase program On March 13, 2012 , the Board of Directors authorized a $15.0 billion common equity (i.e., common stock and warrants) repurchase program (the 2012 program), of which up to $12.0 billion was approved for repurchase in 2012 and up to an additional $3.0 billion is approved through the end of the first quarter of 2013 . During 2012 and 2011 , the Firm repurchased (on a trade-date basis) 31 million and 229 million shares of common stock, for $1.3 billion and $8.8 billion , respectively. During 2012 and 2011 , the Firm repurchased 18 million and 10 million warrants, for $238 million and $122 million , respectively. The Firm did not make any repurchases after May 17, 2012. As of December 31, 2012 , $13.4 billion of authorized repurchase capacity remained under the program. The Firm may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common equity  for example, during internal trading black-out periods. All purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a predefined plan established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublic information. The authorization to repurchase common equity will be utilized at managements discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common equity that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firms capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables; may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs; and may be suspended at any time. ##TABLE_START 22   ##TABLE_ENDShares repurchased pursuant to the common equity repurchase program during 2012 were as follows. ##TABLE_START   Common stock  Warrants      Year ended December 31, 2012  Total shares of common stock repurchased  Average price paid per share of common stock (b)  Total warrants repurchased  Average price paid per warrant (b)  Aggregate repurchases of common equity (in millions) (b)  Dollar value of remaining authorized repurchase (in millions) (c)  Repurchases under the prior $15.0 billion program (a)  2,604,500  $ 33.10    $   $  $ 6,050 (d)  Repurchases under the new $15.0 billion program  2,867,870  45.29       14,870  First quarter (a)  5,472,370  39.49       14,870  Second quarter  28,070,715  42.72  18,471,300  12.90  1,437  13,433  Third quarter            13,433  October            13,433  November            13,433  December            13,433  Fourth quarter            13,433  Year-to-date (a)  33,543,085  $ 42.19  18,471,300  $ 12.90  $ 1,653  $ 13,433  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (a) Includes $86 million of repurchases in December 2011, which settled in early January 2012. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) Excludes commissions cost. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (c) The amount authorized by the Board of Directors excludes commissions cost. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (d) The unused portion of the prior $15.0 billion program was canceled when the $15.0 billion 2012 program was authorized. ##TABLE_END Repurchases under the stock-based incentive plans Participants in the Firms stock-based incentive plans may have shares of common stock withheld to cover income taxes.

As a global financial services firm, JPMorgan Chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the United States and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the United States in which the Firm does business. These laws and regulations significantly affect the way that the Firm does business, and can restrict the scope of the Firms existing businesses and limit the Firms ability to expand its product offerings or to pursue acquisitions, or can make its products and services more expensive for clients and customers. The Firm is currently experiencing an unprecedented increase in regulations and supervision, and such changes could have a significant impact on how the Firm conducts business. Significant and comprehensive new legislation and regulations affecting the financial services industry have been adopted or proposed in recent years, both in the United States and globally, most notably the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States. Certain key regulations such as the Volcker Rule and the U.S. implementation of the Basel III capital standards have now been adopted, and the Firm continues to make appropriate adjustments to its business and operations, legal entity structure and capital and liquidity management policies, procedures and controls to comply with these and other new laws and regulations. However, U.S. and other regulators continue to develop, propose and adopt rules and propose new regulatory initiatives, so the cumulative effect of all of the new legislation and regulations on the Firms business and operations remains uncertain. In addition, there can be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in different countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. Non-U.S. regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the United States, which could create increased compliance and other costs for the Firm and adversely affect its business, operations or profitability. These recent legislative and regulatory developments, as well as future legislative or regulatory actions in the United States and in the other countries in which the Firm operates, could result in a significant loss of revenue for the Firm, impose additional costs on the Firm or otherwise reduce the Firms profitability, limit the Firms ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging, require the Firm to dispose of or curtail certain businesses, affect the value of assets that the Firm holds, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, or otherwise adversely affect the Firms businesses. Expanded regulatory oversight of JPMorgan Chases businesses will increase the Firms compliance costs and risks and may reduce the profitability of those businesses. In recent years the Firm has entered into several Consent Orders with its banking regulators and settlements with various governmental agencies, including the Consent Orders entered into in April 2011 relating to the Firms residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss mitigation activities; the February 2012 global settlement with federal and state government agencies relating to the servicing and origination of mortgages; the Consent Orders entered into in January 2013 relating to the Firms Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering policies, procedures and controls and to Chief Investment Office risk management and control functions as well as trading activities; the Consent Orders entered into September 2013 concerning oversight of third parties, operational processes and control functions related to credit card collections litigation practices and to billing practices for credit monitoring products formerly offered by the Firm; the settlements in November 2013 of certain repurchase representation and warranty claims by a group of institutional investors and with the U.S. Department of Justice, several other federal agencies and several State Attorneys General relating to certain residential mortgage-backed securitization activities of the Firm, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual; the Deferred Prosecution Agreement entered into in January 2014 with the U.S. Department of Justice and related agreements with the OCC and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\"FinCEN\") relating to Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC and the Firm's AML compliance program; and the February  2014 settlement entered into with several federal government agencies relating to the Firms participation in certain federal mortgage insurance programs. These Consent Orders and settlements require the Firm, among other things, to remediate specified deficiencies in certain controls and operational processes; in some cases, to engage internal or external personnel to review past transactions or to monitor the extent to which cited lapses ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I have been addressed; and to furnish its regulators with periodic reports concerning the Firms progress in meeting the requirements of the orders and settlements. The Firm has also paid significant fines and penalties or provided monetary and other relief in connection with many of these actions and settlements. The Firm is devoting substantial resources to satisfying the requirements of these Consent Orders and settlements, including comprehensive enhancements to its procedures and controls, the expansion of risk and control functions within each line of business, investments in technology and the hiring of significant numbers of additional risk, control and compliance personnel, all of which has increased the Firms operational and compliance costs. In addition to these enforcement actions, the Firm is experiencing heightened regulatory oversight of its compliance with applicable laws and regulations, particularly with respect to its consumer businesses. The Firm expects that such regulatory scrutiny will continue, and that regulators will continue to take formal enforcement action, rather than taking informal supervisory actions, more frequently than they have done historically. If the Firm fails to successfully address the requirements of the Consent Orders, the Deferred Prosecution Agreement and the other regulatory settlements and enforcement actions to which it is subject, or more generally, to effectively enhance its risk and control procedures and processes to meet heightened expectations by its regulators, it may continue to face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions and litigation, thereby increasing its costs associated with responding to or defending such actions, and it could be required to enter into further orders and settlements, pay additional fines, penalties or judgments, or accept material regulatory restrictions on its businesses, which could adversely affect the Firms operations and, in turn, its financial results. In addition, further regulatory inquiries, investigations and actions, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting the Firms businesses, and any required changes to the Firms business operations resulting from these developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, limit the products or services the Firm offers, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, impose additional compliance costs on the Firm, cause harm to the Firms reputation or otherwise adversely affect the Firms businesses. Under the Firms resolution plan required to be submitted by the Dodd-Frank Act resolution provisions, holders of the Firms debt obligations are at clear risk of loss in any resolution proceedings. In October 2013, JPMorgan Chase submitted to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC its annual update to its plan for resolution of the Firm. The Firms resolution plan includes strategies to resolve the Firm under the Bankruptcy Code, and also recommends to the FDIC and the Federal Reserve the Firms proposed optimal strategy to resolve the Firm under the special resolution procedure provided in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (Title II). The Firms recommendation for its optimal Title II strategy would involve a single point of entry recapitalization model in which the FDIC would use its power to create a bridge entity for JPMorgan Chase, transfer the systemically important and viable parts of the Firms business, principally the stock of JPMorgan Chase  Co.s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries, to the bridge entity, recapitalize those businesses by contributing some or all of such intercompany claims to the capital of such subsidiaries, and by exchanging debt claims against JPMorgan Chase  Co. for equity in the bridge entity. If the Firm were to be resolved under this strategy, no assurance can be given that the value of the stock of the bridge entity distributed to the holders of debt obligations of JPMorgan Chase  Co. would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or part of the principal amount of, and interest on, the debt obligations for which such stock was exchanged. Market Risk JPMorgan Chases results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by U.S. and international financial market and economic conditions. JPMorgan Chases businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions, including the liquidity of the global financial markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates and currency and commodities prices; investor sentiment; events that reduce confidence in the financial markets; inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit; the economic effects of natural disasters, several weather conditions, acts of war or terrorism; monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks and the health of U.S. or international economies. In the Firms wholesale businesses, the above-mentioned factors can affect transactions involving the Firms underwriting and advisory businesses; the realization of cash returns from its private equity business; the volume of transactions that the Firm executes for its customers and, therefore, the revenue that the Firm receives from commissions and spreads; and the willingness of financial sponsors or other investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the Firm. The Firm generally maintains extensive market-making positions in the fixed income, currency, commodities and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients. The Firm may have market-making positions that lack pricing transparency or liquidity. The revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors, including the Firms success in effectively hedging its market and other risks, volatility in interest rates and equity, debt and commodities markets, credit spreads, and ##TABLE_START 10   ##TABLE_ENDavailability of liquidity in the capital markets, all of which are affected by economic and market conditions. The Firm anticipates that revenue relating to its market-making and private equity businesses will continue to experience volatility, which will affect pricing or the ability to realize returns from such activities, and that this could materially adversely affect the Firms earnings. The fees that the Firm earns for managing third-party assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in securities markets could affect the valuations of the third-party assets that the Firm manages or holds in custody, which, in turn, could affect the Firms revenue. Macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the Firms funds or accounts. Changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the Firms balance sheet and the revenue that the Firm earns from net interest income. A low interest rate environment or a flat or inverted yield curve may adversely affect certain of the Firms businesses by compressing net interest margins, reducing the amounts that the Firm earns on its investment securities portfolio, or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights (MSR) asset, thereby reducing the Firms net interest income and other revenues. The Firms consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions, including U.S. interest rates; the rate of unemployment; housing prices; the level of consumer confidence; changes in consumer spending; and the number of personal bankruptcies. If the current positive trends in the U.S. economy are not sustained, this could diminish demand for the products and services of the Firms consumer businesses, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. In addition, adverse economic conditions, such as declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment, could lead to an increase in mortgage, credit card and other loan delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce the Firms earnings. Widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the Firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis. Credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to Firm-specific events and circumstances, but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in the Firms credit spreads will impact, positively or negatively, the Firms earnings on liabilities that are recorded at fair value. Finally, adverse economic and financial market conditions in specific countries or regions can have significant adverse effects on the Firms business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For example, during the recent Eurozone debt crisis, concerns about the possibility of one or more sovereign debt defaults, significant bank failures or defaults and/or the exit of one or more countries from the European Monetary Union resulted in, among other things, declines in market liquidity, a contraction of available credit, and diminished economic growth and business confidence in the Eurozone. There are continuing concerns as to the ultimate financial effectiveness of the assistance measures taken to date, and the extent to which the austerity measures may exacerbate high unemployment and test the social and political stability of weaker economies in the Eurozone. The Firms business and results of operations can be adversely affected both by localized economic crises in parts of the world where the Firm does business or when regional economic turmoil causes deterioration of global economic conditions. Credit Risk The financial condition of JPMorgan Chases customers, clients and counterparties, including other financial institutions, could adversely affect the Firm. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of market-making, trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, investment managers and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Firm to credit risk and, in some cases, disputes and litigation in the event of a default by the counterparty or client. The Firm is a market leader in providing clearing and custodial services, and also acts as a clearing and custody bank in the securities and repurchase transaction market, including the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. Many of these services expose the Firm to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client, a central counterparty (CCP) or another market participant. As part of providing clearing services, the Firm is a member of a number of CCPs, and may be required to pay a portion of the losses incurred by such organizations as a result of the default of other members. As a clearing member, the Firm is also exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate through the maintenance of adequate collateral. In its role as custodian bank in the securities and repurchase transaction market, the Firm can be exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients. If a client to whom the Firm provides such services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the Firm may become involved in disputes and litigation with various parties, including one or more CCPs, the clients bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or involved in regulatory investigations. All of such events can increase the Firms operational and litigation costs and may result in losses if any collateral received by the Firm declines in value. During periods of market stress or illiquidity, the Firms credit risk also may be further increased when the Firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to the Firm. Further, disputes with obligors as ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I to the valuation of collateral significantly increase in times of market stress and illiquidity. Periods of illiquidity could produce losses if the Firm is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral. Concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses. JPMorgan Chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. As a result, the Firm regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks. The Firms efforts to diversify or hedge its credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful. In addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the Firms inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce the Firms positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on the Firms balance sheet, thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs, all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the Firms businesses. Liquidity Risk If JPMorgan Chase does not effectively manage its liquidity, its business could suffer. JPMorgan Chases liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses. Some potential conditions that could impair the Firms liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise experiencing disruption, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including, among others, commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities (SPEs) or other entities), difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets, unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, and lack of market or customer confidence in the Firm or financial markets in general. These conditions may be caused by events over which the Firm has little or no control. The widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the Firms cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity (such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, credit card receivables and other assets) during that time, and there is no assurance that these conditions could not occur in the future. If the Firms access to stable and low cost sources of funding, such as bank deposits, are reduced, the Firm may need to raise alternative funding which may be more expensive or of limited availability. As a holding company, JPMorgan Chase  Co. relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and, consequently, its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations. These payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, loans or other payments. Several of JPMorgan Chase  Co.s principal subsidiaries are subject to dividend distribution or capital adequacy requirements or other regulatory restrictions on their ability to provide such payments. Limitations in the payments that JPMorgan Chase  Co. receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its liquidity position. Some regulators have proposed legislation or regulations requiring large banks to incorporate a separate subsidiary in countries in which they operate, and to maintain independent capital and liquidity for such subsidiaries. If adopted, these requirements could hinder the Firms ability to efficiently manage its funding and liquidity in a centralized manner. Reductions in the Firms credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding, as well as the value of debt obligations issued by the Firm. JPMorgan Chase  Co. and certain of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., are currently rated by credit rating agencies. In 2013, Moodys downgraded its ratings of JPMorgan Chase  Co. and several other bank holding companies based on Moodys reassessment of its assumptions relating to implicit government support for such companies. In addition, as of year-end 2013, SP had JPMorgan Chase  Co. on negative outlook, indicating the possibility of a downgrade in ratings. Although the Firm closely monitors and manages factors influencing its credit ratings, there is no assurance that such ratings will not be lowered in the future. Furthermore, the rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, rating uplift assumptions surrounding government support, future profitability, risk management practices and legal expenses, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions. There is no assurance that any such downgrades from rating agencies, if they affected the Firms credit ratings, would not occur at times of broader market instability when the Firms options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low. Further, a reduction in the Firms credit ratings could reduce the Firms access to debt markets, materially increase the cost of issuing debt, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted, contractually or otherwise, to do business with or lend to the Firm, thereby curtailing the Firms business operations and reducing its profitability. In addition, any such reduction in credit ratings may increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase  Co. and its subsidiaries and, as a result, could adversely affect the value of debt obligations that they have issued or may issue in the future . ##TABLE_START 12   ##TABLE_ENDLegal Risk JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the Firm. JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against the Firm may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Firm, which could materially adversely affect the Firms business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to the Firm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that the Firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations. In addition, and as noted above, the Firms businesses and operations are also subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. As the regulators and other government agencies continue to examine the operations of the Firm and its bank subsidiaries, there is no assurance that additional consent orders or other enforcement actions will not be issued by them in the future. These and other initiatives from federal and state officials may subject the Firm to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause the Firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, or higher operational costs, thereby reducing the Firms revenue. Business and Operational Risks JPMorgan Chases operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary and political developments in the United States and around the world. JPMorgan Chases businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities and agencies. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the United States and the return earned on those loans and investments. Changes in Federal Reserve policies (as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of non-U.S. central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies) are beyond the Firms control and, consequently, the impact of changes in these policies on the Firms activities and results of operations is difficult to predict. The Firms businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and market-making in securities of companies worldwide. These risks include, among others, risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, in the countries in which such companies operate, as well as the other risks and considerations as described further below. Several of the Firms businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities. These activities can expose the Firm to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputational risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, which could adversely affect the Firms financial condition and results of operations. Further, various countries in which the Firm operates or invests, or in which the Firm may do so in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. In some cases, concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries can lead to market contagion to other countries in the same region or beyond the region. Accordingly, it is possible that economic disruptions in certain countries, even in countries in which the Firm does not conduct business or have operations, will adversely affect the Firm. JPMorgan Chases international strategy may be hindered by local political, social and economic factors, and will be subject to additional compliance costs and risks. JPMorgan Chase has expanded and plans to continue to grow its international wholesale businesses in Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA), Asia/Pacific and Latin America/Caribbean over time. As part of its international strategy, the Firm seeks to provide a wider range of financial services to its clients that conduct business in those regions. Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its wholesale businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the United States and other developed markets in which the Firm currently operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, or low or negative growth, among other negative conditions, or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment. In addition, these countries have historically been more susceptible to unfavorable political, social or economic developments which have in the past resulted in, and may in the future lead to, social unrest, general strikes and demonstrations, outbreaks of hostilities, overthrow of incumbent governments, terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord, all of which can adversely affect the Firms operations or investments in such countries. Political, social or economic disruption or dislocation in certain countries or regions in which the Firm conducts its wholesale businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations, and there can be no assurance that the Firm will be able to successfully execute its international strategy. ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I Less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the Firms operations in those countries, including, among others, the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations; uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations; difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive; and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions. Revenue from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations, as well as due to governmental actions including expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, and changes in laws and regulations. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets. Also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can, and has in the past, affected the Firms operations and investments in another country or countries, including the Firms operations in the United States. As a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the Firms business and results of operations. Conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the Firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. There can be no assurance that the Firm will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems. In addition, the Firm can also incur higher costs, and face greater compliance risks, in structuring its operations outside the United States to comply with U.S. anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. JPMorgan Chases commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation, potential catastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose the Firm to significant cost and liability. JPMorgan Chase engages in the storage, transportation, marketing or trading of several commodities, including metals, agricultural products, crude oil, oil products, natural gas, electric power, emission credits, coal, freight, and related products and indices. The Firm is also engaged in power generation and has invested in companies engaged in wind energy and in sourcing, developing and trading emission reduction credits. As a result of all of these activities, the Firm is subject to extensive and evolving energy, commodities, environmental, and other governmental laws and regulations. The Firm expects laws and regulations affecting its commodities activities to expand in scope and complexity, and to restrict some of the Firms activities, which could result in lower revenues from the Firms commodities activities. In addition, the Firm may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations, and the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. Furthermore, liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations for remediation of contaminations. The Firms commodities activities also further expose the Firm to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events, including natural disasters, leaks, spills, explosions, release of toxic substances, fires, accidents on land and at sea, wars, and terrorist attacks that could result in personal injuries, loss of life, property damage, damage to the Firms reputation and suspension of operations. The Firms commodities activities are also subject to disruptions, many of which are outside of the Firms control, from the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment, transmission lines or other equipment or processes, and the contractual failure of performance by third-party suppliers or service providers, including the failure to obtain and deliver raw materials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities. The Firms actions to mitigate its risks related to the above-mentioned considerations may not prove adequate to address every contingency. In addition, insurance covering some of these risks may not be available, and the proceeds, if any, from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents. As a result, the Firms financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by such events. JPMorgan Chase relies on the integrity of its operating systems and employees, and those of third parties, and certain failures of such systems or misconduct by such employees could materially adversely affect the Firms operations. JPMorgan Chases businesses are dependent on the Firms ability to process, record and monitor a large number of complex transactions. If the Firms financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Firm could be materially adversely affected. The Firm is similarly dependent on its employees. The Firm could be materially adversely affected if one or more of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the Firms operations or systems. In addition, as the Firm changes processes or introduces new products and services, the Firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Any of these occurrences could diminish the Firms ability to ##TABLE_START 14   ##TABLE_ENDoperate one or more of its businesses, or result in potential liability to clients, increased operating expenses, higher litigation costs (including fines and sanctions), reputational damage, regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Firm. Third parties with which the Firm does business, as well as retailers and other third parties with which the Firms customers do business, can also be sources of operational risk to the Firm, including with respect to security breaches affecting such parties and breakdowns or failures of the systems or misconduct by the employees of such parties. Incidents of these types may require the Firm to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Firm or its customers, thereby increasing the Firms operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the Firms possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Firm could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either through the fault of the Firms systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. The Firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the Firms control, which may include, for example, security breaches (as discussed further below); electrical or telecommunications outages; failures of computer servers or other damage to the Firms property or assets; natural disasters or severe weather conditions; health emergencies or pandemics; or events arising from local or larger scale political events, including terrorist acts. JPMorgan Chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure that the Firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. While the Firm believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate, there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the Firm. Any failures or disruptions of the Firms systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients, adversely affect the Firms business and results of operations by subjecting the Firm to losses or liability, or require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption, as well as by exposing the Firm to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance. A breach in the security of JPMorgan Chases systems could disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the Firm. Although JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Firms computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Firm and its customers, there is no assurance that all of the Firms security measures will provide absolute security. JPMorgan Chase and other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. In particular, the Firm has experienced several significant distributed denial-of-service attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties which were intended to disrupt online banking services, as well as data breaches due to cyberattacks which, in certain instances, have resulted in unauthorized access to customer data. Despite the Firms efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, it is possible that the Firm may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Firm such as persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Firms systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Firms data or that of its customers or clients. These risks may increase in the future as the Firm continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the Firms systems could cause serious negative consequences for the Firm, including significant disruption of the Firms operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Firm or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Firm and those of its customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Firm or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Firms security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I litigation exposure, and harm to the Firms reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Firm. Risk Management JPMorgan Chases framework for managing risks and its risk management procedures and practices may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to the Firm, thereby resulting in losses. JPMorgan Chases risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the Firm. The Firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which the Firm is subject. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the Firms risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that the Firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified. Any lapse in the Firms risk management framework and governance structure or other inadequacies in the design or implementation of the Firms risk management framework, governance, procedures or practices could, individually or in the aggregate, cause unexpected losses for the Firm, materially and adversely affect the Firms financial condition and results of operations, require significant resources to remediate any risk management deficiency, attract heightened regulatory scrutiny, expose the Firm to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings, subject the Firm to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firms reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence. The Firms products, including loans, leases, lending commitments, derivatives, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale, as well as cash management and clearing activities, expose the Firm to credit risk. As one of the nations largest lenders, the Firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties, and the credit quality of the Firms exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings. The Firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses inherent in its credit exposure, including unfunded lending commitments. The Firm also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the Firm in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to the Firms financial results and condition, and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the Firms borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the possibility that the Firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the Firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies. JPMorgan Chases market-making businesses may expose the Firm to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause the Firm to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument such as a derivative. Certain of the Firms derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities, commodities or obligations that the Firm does not own; if the Firm is unable to obtain such securities, commodities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery, this could cause the Firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays, which could damage the Firms reputation and ability to transact future business. In addition, in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis, the Firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, the Firm may be exposed to market and operational losses. In particular, disputes regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts could arise, which could force the Firm to incur unexpected costs, including transaction, legal and litigation costs, and impair the Firms ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products. In a difficult or less liquid market environment, the Firms risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for the Firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants. Many of the Firms risk management strategies or techniques have a basis in historical market behavior, and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on managements subjective judgment. For example, many models used by the Firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements. These sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited and could again limit the effectiveness of the Firms risk management strategies, causing the Firm to incur losses. Many of the models used by the Firm are subject to review not only by the Firms Model Risk function but also by the Firms regulators in order that the Firm may utilize such models in connection with the Firms calculations of market risk risk-weighted assets (RWA) and credit risk RWA under the Advanced Approach of Basel III. The Firm may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit its ability to expand its businesses, if such models do not receive approval by its regulators. In addition, there is no assurance that the amount of capital that the Firm holds with respect to operational risk, as derived from its operational risk capital model required under the Basel III capital standards, will ##TABLE_START 16   ##TABLE_ENDnot be required to increase, which may have the effect of reducing the Firms profitability. In addition, the Firm must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with vendors and other third parties that provide services to the Firm. These requirements apply to the Firm both under general guidance issued by the banking regulators and, more specifically, under the Consent Order entered into by the Firm relating to collections litigation practices. The Firm has incurred and expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships. Failure by the Firm to appropriately assess and manage third party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could result in potential liability to clients and customers, fines, penalties or judgments imposed by the Firms regulators, increased operating expenses and harm to the Firms reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Firm. Lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the Firms operations, profitability or reputation. There can be no assurance that the Firms disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting could not occur again. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect the Firms business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose the Firm to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject it to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firms reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence. Other Risks The financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chases inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations. JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment and the Firm expects competitive conditions to continue to intensify as the financial services industry produces better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, investment managers, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and Internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading. The Firms businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firms products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the Firms products and services or may cause the Firm to lose market share. Increased competition also may require the Firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses in order to remain competitive. These investments may increase expense or may require the Firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger, more competitive transactions. The Firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect its future results of operations. Competitors of the Firms non-U.S. wholesale businesses are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. For example, the regulatory objectives underlying several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the prohibition on proprietary trading under the Volcker Rule and the derivatives push-out rules, have not been embraced by governments and regulatory agencies outside the United States and may not be implemented into law in most countries. The more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to U.S. financial services institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase, can put the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to its non-U.S. competitors, including prohibiting the Firm from engaging in certain transactions, making the Firms pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the Firms cost structure for providing certain products, all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the Firms wholesale businesses. JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business, and failure to do so may materially adversely affect the Firms performance. JPMorgan Chases employees are the Firms most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The imposition on the Firm or its employees of restrictions on executive compensation may adversely affect the Firms ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees. If the Firm is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, the Firms performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I JPMorgan Chases financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future. Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, JPMorgan Chase is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation, among other items. Certain of the Firms financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, available-for-sale securities, certain loans, MSRs, private equity investments, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Firms financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Firms financial statements are incorrect, the Firm may experience material losses. Damage to JPMorgan Chases reputation could damage its businesses. Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to the Firms ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. Damage to the Firms reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the Firms business and prospects. Harm to the Firms reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. The Firms reputation could also be harmed by the failure of an affiliate, joint-venturer or merchant banking portfolio company, or a vendor or other third party with which the Firm does business, to comply with laws or regulations. In addition, a failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to the Firms reputation. Adverse publicity regarding the Firm, whether or not true, may result in harm to the Firms prospects. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the Firms reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis, including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions, has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole. Should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the Firms reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the Firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm could not adversely affect the Firms earnings and results of operations. Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the Firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among the Firms clients. The failure to adequately address, or the perceived failure to adequately address, conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the Firm, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions, as well as cause serious reputational harm to the Firm.

On December 17, 2013, the Firm sold One Chase Manhattan Plaza, a 60-story, 2.2 million square foot office building. Contemporaneously, the Firm entered into a lease back agreement on approximately 1.2 million square feet of space in the building for one year in order to provide time to relocate its employees to other locations, predominantly in New York and New Jersey. Additionally, the Firm entered into long-term lease back agreements ranging from five to ten years for approximately 0.3 million square feet of space, which includes five office floors, portions of the  lower level space, and retail branch space on the ground floor.

The properties occupied by JPMorgan Chase are used across all of the Firms business segments and for corporate purposes. JPMorgan Chase continues to evaluate its current and projected space requirements and may determine from time to time that certain of its premises and facilities are no longer necessary for its operations. There is no assurance that the Firm will be able to dispose of any such excess premises or that it will not incur charges in connection with such dispositions.

Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase , lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls in the future. For further information, see Managements report on internal control over financial reporting on page 182 . There was no change in the Firms internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended  December 31, 2013 , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firms internal control over financial reporting.

JPMorgan Chases businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and range of their products and services, transaction execution, innovation and price. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. With respect to some of its geographies and products, JPMorgan Chase competes globally; with respect to others, the Firm competes on a national or regional basis. The Firms ability to compete also depends on its ability to attract and retain professional and other personnel, and on its reputation. The financial services industry has experienced consolidation and convergence in recent years, as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial products and services have merged and, in some cases, failed. This consolidation is expected to continue. Consolidation could result in competitors of JPMorgan Chase gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. It is likely that competition will become even more intense as the Firms businesses continue to compete with other financial institutions that may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies or that operate under different rules and regulatory regimes than the Firm. Supervision and regulation The Firm is subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as well as the applicable laws of each of the various jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business. As a result of rule-making following the enactment of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) and other regulatory reforms enacted and proposed in the U.S. and abroad, the Firm is currently experiencing a period of unprecedented change in regulation and such changes could have a significant impact on how the Firm conducts business. The Firm continues to work diligently in assessing the regulatory changes it is facing, and is devoting substantial resources to implementing all the new regulations, while, at the same time, best meeting the needs and expectations of its ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I customers, clients and shareholders. The combined effect of numerous rule-makings by multiple governmental agencies and regulators, and the potential conflicts or inconsistencies among such rules, present challenges and risks to the Firms business and operations. Given the current status of the regulatory developments, the Firm cannot currently quantify the possible effects on its business and operations of all of the significant changes that are currently underway. For more information, see Risk Factors on pages 817 . Financial holding company: Consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve . As a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company, JPMorgan Chase is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve). The Federal Reserve acts as an umbrella regulator and certain of JPMorgan Chases subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional authorities based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries. For example, JPMorgan Chases national bank subsidiaries, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Chase Bank USA, N.A., are subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and, with respect to certain matters, by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC). Non-bank subsidiaries, such as the Firms U.S. broker-dealers, are subject to supervision and regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and with respect to certain futures-related and swaps-related activities, by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). See Securities and broker-dealer regulation, Investment management regulation and Derivatives regulation below. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, JPMorgan Chase is, or will become, subject to (among other things) significantly revised and expanded regulation and supervision, additional limitations on the way it conducts its businesses, and heightened capital and liquidity requirements. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which was created by the Dodd-Frank Act, has rulemaking, enforcement and examination authority over JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries with respect to federal consumer protection laws. Scope of permissible business activities. The Bank Holding Company Act generally restricts BHCs from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities. Financial holding companies generally can engage in a broader range of financial activities than are otherwise permissible for BHCs, as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for financial holding companies (including requirements that the financial holding company and each of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries maintain their status as well capitalized and well managed). The broader range of permissible activities for financial holding companies includes underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities, and making merchant banking investments in non-financial companies. The Federal Reserve has the authority to limit a financial holding companys ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible if the financial holding company or any of its depositary institution subsidiaries ceases to meet the applicable eligibility requirements. The Federal Reserve may also impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may require divestiture of the holding companys depository institutions if the deficiencies persist. Federal regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies. In addition, a financial holding company must obtain Federal Reserve approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both in the U.S. and internationally, as further described under Regulation of acquisitions below. Activities restrictions under the Volcker Rule. Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the Volcker Rule) prohibits banking entities, including the Firm, from engaging in certain proprietary trading activities, subject to exceptions for underwriting, market-making, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. In addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship, and investment in, covered funds (as defined by the Rule) and imposes limits on certain transactions between the Firm and its sponsored funds (see Investment management regulation below). The Volcker Rule requires banking entities to establish comprehensive compliance programs designed to help ensure and monitor compliance with the restrictions under the Volcker Rule, including, in order to distinguish permissible from impermissible risk-taking activities, the measurement and monitoring of seven metrics. The Firm has taken significant steps to comply with the Volcker Rule. However, given the complexity of the new framework, and the fact that many provisions of the Rule still require further regulatory guidance, the full impact of the Volcker Rule is still uncertain and will ultimately depend on the interpretation and implementation by the five regulatory agencies responsible for its oversight. Capital and liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve establishes capital and leverage requirements for the Firm and evaluates its compliance with such capital requirements. The OCC establishes similar capital and leverage requirements for the Firms national banking subsidiaries. For more information about the applicable requirements relating to risk-based capital and leverage in the U.S. under the Basel Committees most recent capital framework (Basel III), see Regulatory capital on pages 146153 and Note 28. It is likely that the banking supervisors will continue to refine and enhance the Basel III capital framework for financial institutions. Recent proposals being contemplated by the Basel Committee ##TABLE_START 2   ##TABLE_ENDinclude, among others, revisions to market risk capital for trading books, credit risk capital calculations, the measurement methodology to calculate counterparty credit risk and revisions to the securitization framework. After a proposal is finalized by the Basel Committee, U.S. banking regulators would then need to propose requirements applicable to U.S. financial institutions. Under Basel III, bank holding companies and banks are required to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests: the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). For additional information on these ratios, see Liquidity Risk Management on pages 156160 . Stress tests. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has adopted supervisory stress tests for large bank holding companies, including JPMorgan Chase, which form part of the Federal Reserves annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) framework. Under the framework, the Firm must conduct semi-annual company-run stress tests, and, in addition, must submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by the Firm and the Federal Reserve. In reviewing the Firms capital plan, the Federal Reserve will consider both quantitative and qualitative factors. Qualitative assessments will include (among other things) the comprehensiveness of the plan, the assumptions and analysis underlying the plan, and the extent to which the Firm has satisfied certain supervisory matters related to the Firms processes and analyses. Moreover, the Firm is required to receive a notice of non-objection from the Federal Reserve before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to perform separate, similar annual stress tests. The Firm publishes on its website each year, in July, the results of its mid-year stress tests under the Firms internally-developed severely adverse scenario and, in March, the results of its (and its two primary subsidiary banks) annual CCAR stress tests under the Federal Reserves severely adverse scenario. Commencing with the 2016 CCAR, the annual CCAR submission will be due April 5 th . Results will be published by the Federal Reserve by June 30 th , with disclosures of results by BHCs to follow within 15 days. Also commencing in 2016, the mid-cycle capital stress test submissions will be due October 5 th and BHCs will publish results by November 4 th . For additional information on the Firms CCAR, see Regulatory capital on pages 146153 . Enhanced prudential standards. The Dodd-Frank Act established a new oversight body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which (among other things) recommends prudential standards, reporting and disclosure requirements to the Federal Reserve for systemically important financial institutions. BHCs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, such as JPMorgan Chase, became automatically subject to the heightened prudential standards. The Federal Reserve has adopted several rules to implement certain of the heightened prudential standards contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act, including final rules relating to risk management and corporate governance of subject bank holding companies. Beginning January 1, 2015, the rules require BHCs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, including a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days, and increased involvement by boards of directors in risk management. Several additional proposed rules are still being considered, including rules relating to single-counterparty credit limits and an early remediation framework to address financial distress or material management weaknesses. Risk reporting. In January 2013, the Basel Committee issued new regulations relating to risk aggregation and reporting. Under these regulations, the banking institutions risk governance framework must encompass risk-data aggregation and reporting, and data aggregation must be highly automated and allow for minimal manual intervention. The regulations also impose higher standards for the accuracy, comprehensiveness, granularity and timely distribution of data reporting, and call for regular supervisory review of the banking institutions risk aggregation and reporting. Global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) will be required to comply with these new standards by January 1, 2016. Orderly liquidation authority and other financial stability measures. As a BHC with assets of $50 billion or more, the Firm is required to submit annually to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for resolution under the Bankruptcy Code in the event of material distress or failure (a resolution plan). The FDIC also requires each insured depositary institution with $50 billion or more in assets to provide a resolution plan. For more information about the Firms resolution plan, see Risk Factors on pages 817 . In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain financial companies, including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its subsidiaries, can be subjected to resolution under a new orderly liquidation authority. The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States, must first make certain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk determinations, and action must be recommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent such actions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain subject to resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. In December 2013, the FDIC released its single point of entry strategy for resolution of systemically important financial institutions under the orderly liquidation authority. This strategy seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of the BHC open and impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the holding company in receivership according to their statutory order of priority. Regulators in the U.S. and abroad continue to be focused on measures to address too big to fail, and to provide safeguards so that, if a large financial institution does fail, it can be resolved without the use of public funds. Higher ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I capital surcharges on G-SIBs, requirements recently introduced by the Federal Reserve that certain large bank holding companies maintain a minimum amount of long-term debt to facilitate orderly resolution of those firms, and the recently adopted ISDA protocol relating to the close-out of derivatives transactions during the resolution of a large cross-border financial institution, are examples of initiatives to address too big to fail. For further information on the potential impact of the G-SIB framework and Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC), see Regulatory capital on pages 146153 , and on the ISDA close-out protocol, see Derivatives regulation below. Holding company as source of strength for bank subsidiaries . JPMorgan Chase  Co. is required to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the Federal Reserve at times when the Firm might otherwise determine not to provide it. Regulation of acquisitions. Financial holding companies and bank holding companies are required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before they may acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of an unaffiliated bank. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act restricts acquisitions by financial companies if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies. This could have the effect of allowing a non-U.S. financial company to grow to hold significantly more than 10% of the U.S. market without exceeding the concentration limit. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Firm must provide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company with over $10 billion in assets that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature. JPMorgan Chases subsidiary banks: The Firms two primary subsidiary banks, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., are FDIC-insured national banks regulated by the OCC. As national banks, the activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. are limited to those specifically authorized under the National Bank Act and related interpretations by the OCC. FDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance fund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, which is funded through assessments on banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. Changes in the methodology of the calculation of such assessments, resulting from the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, significantly increased the assessments the Firms bank subsidiaries pay annually to the FDIC, and future FDIC rule-making could further increase such assessments. FDIC powers upon a bank insolvency . Upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC may be appointed the conservator or receiver under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA). In addition, as noted above, where a systemically important financial institution, such as JPMorgan Chase  Co., is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation. In both cases, the FDIC has broad powers to transfer any assets and liabilities without the approval of the institutions creditors. Cross-guarantee . An FDIC-insured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the FDIC in connection with another FDIC-insured institution under common control with such institution being in default or in danger of default (commonly referred to as cross-guarantee liability). An FDIC cross-guarantee claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution. Prompt corrective action and early remediation . The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. While these regulations apply only to banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against the parent BHC, such as JPMorgan Chase  Co., based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In certain instances, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary. OCC Heightened Standards. The OCC has released final regulations and guidelines establishing heightened standards for large banks. The guidelines establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks. While the bank may use certain components of the parent companys risk governance framework, the framework must ensure that the banks risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from the parent for risk management purposes. The banks board or risk committee is responsible for approving the banks risk governance framework, providing active oversight of the banks risk-taking activities and holding management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework. Restrictions on transactions with affiliates . The bank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other transactions with, JPMorgan Chase and certain other affiliates, and on investments in stock or securities of JPMorgan Chase and affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan Chase and other affiliates from borrowing from a bank subsidiary unless the loans are secured in specified amounts and are subject to certain other limits. For more information, see Note 27. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, these restrictions were extended to derivatives and securities lending transactions. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Acts Volcker Rule imposes similar restrictions on transactions between banking entities, such as JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries, and hedge funds or ##TABLE_START 4   ##TABLE_ENDprivate equity funds for which the banking entity serves as the investment manager, investment advisor or sponsor. Dividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. See Note 27 for the amount of dividends that the Firms principal bank subsidiaries could pay, at January 1, 2015, to their respective bank holding companies without the approval of their banking regulators. In addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including JPMorgan Chase and its bank and BHC subsidiaries, if, in the banking regulators opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. Depositor preference . Under federal law, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC) have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including public noteholders and depositors in non-U.S. offices. As a result, such persons could receive substantially less than the depositors in U.S. offices of the depository institution. The U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (the PRA) has issued a proposal that may require the Firm to either obtain equal treatment for U.K. depositors or subsidiarize in the U.K. In September 2013, the FDIC issued a final rule, which clarifies that foreign deposits are considered deposits under the FDIA only if they are also payable in the U.S. CFPB regulation and supervision, and other consumer regulations. The CFPB has rulemaking, enforcement and examination authority over JPMorgan Chase and its national bank subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition under the Dodd-Frank Act of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. These laws include the Truth-in-Lending, Equal Credit Opportunity (ECOA), Fair Credit Reporting, Fair Debt Collection Practice, Electronic Funds Transfer, Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) and Home Mortgage Disclosure Acts. The CFPB also has authority to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service. The CFPB has issued informal guidance on a variety of topics (such as the collection of consumer debts and credit card marketing practices) and has taken enforcement actions against certain financial institutions. Much of the CFPBs initial rulemaking efforts have addressed mortgage related topics, including ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requirements, appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higher-priced mortgages. Other areas of recent focus include add-on products, matters involving consumer populations considered vulnerable by the CFPB (such as students), and the furnishing of credit scores to individuals. The CFPB has been focused on automobile dealer discretionary interest rate markups, and on holding the Firm and other purchasers of such contracts (indirect lenders) responsible under the ECOA for statistical disparities in markups charged by the dealers to borrowers of different races or ethnicities. The Firm has adopted programs to address these risks, including an active dealer education, monitoring and review programs. The activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. as consumer lenders also are subject to regulation under various state statutes which are enforced by the respective states Attorney General. Securities and broker-dealer regulation: The Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and other broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations of the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the New York Stock Exchange, among others. The Firm conducts similar securities activities outside the U.S. subject to local regulatory requirements. In the United Kingdom, those activities are conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc, which is regulated by the PRA (a subsidiary of the Bank of England which has responsibility for prudential regulation of banks and other systemically important institutions) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) (which regulates prudential matters for other firms and conduct matters for all market participants). Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customers funds, the financing of clients purchases, capital structure, record-keeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers and employees. For information on the net capital of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Clearing Corp., and the applicable requirements relating to risk-based capital for J.P. Morgan Securities plc, see Regulatory capital on pages 146153 . Future rule-making mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act will involve (among other things) the standard of care applicable to broker-dealers when dealing with retail customers and additional requirements regarding securitization practices. Investment management regulation: The Firms investment management business is subject to significant regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding of client assets, offerings of funds, marketing activities, transactions among affiliates and management of client funds. Certain of the Firms subsidiaries are registered with, and subject to oversight by, the SEC as investment advisers. As such, the Firms registered investment advisers are subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as various states securities laws. The Firms asset management business continues to be affected by ongoing rule-making. In July 2013, the SEC adopted amendments to rules that govern money-market funds, requiring a floating net asset value for institutional prime money market funds. Many of the Volcker Rule regulations regarding covered funds, and their impact on the Firms asset management activities, particularly the seeding of foreign public funds and the criteria for establishing foreign public funds status, await further guidance from the regulators. Derivatives regulation: Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its derivatives business. The regulations impose capital and margin requirements, require central clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives, require that they be traded on regulated exchanges or execution facilities, and provide for reporting of certain mandated information. In addition, the Act requires the registration of swap dealers and major swap participants with the CFTC and of security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants with the SEC. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities plc and J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corporation have registered with the CFTC as swap dealers, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc have registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers. As a result of such registration, these entities will be subject to, in addition to new capital requirements, new rules limiting the types of swap activities that may be engaged in by bank entities, a new margin regime for uncleared swaps, new rules regarding segregation of customer collateral, and business conduct and documentation standards with respect to other swaps counterparties, record-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-fraud and anti-manipulation requirements related to their swaps activities. Further, some of the rules for derivatives apply extraterritorially to U.S. firms doing business with clients outside of the U.S.; however the full scope of the extra-territorial impact of the U.S. swaps regulation remains unclear. The effect of the rules issued under the Dodd-Frank Act will necessitate banking entities, such as the Firm, to modify the structure of their derivatives businesses and face increased operational and regulatory costs. In the European Union (the EU), the implementation of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and the revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) will result in comparable, but not identical, changes to the European regulatory regime for derivatives. The combined effect of the U.S. and EU requirements, and the potential conflicts and inconsistencies between them, present challenges and risks to the structure and operating model of the Firms derivatives businesses. The Firm, along with 17 other financial institutions, agreed in November 2014 to adhere to the Resolution Stay Protocol developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. in response to regulator concerns that the closeout of derivatives transactions during the resolution of a large cross-border financial institution could impede resolution efforts and potentially destabilize markets. The Resolution Stay Protocol provides for the contractual recognition of cross-border stays under various statutory resolution regimes and a contractual stay on certain cross-default rights. In the U.S., two subsidiaries of the Firm are registered as futures commission merchants, and other subsidiaries are either registered with the CFTC as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors or exempt from such registration. These CFTC-registered subsidiaries are also members of the National Futures Association. The Firms financial commodities business is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Data regulation: The Firm and its subsidiaries also are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations concerning the use and protection of certain customer, employee and other personal and confidential information, including those imposed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as well as the EU Data Protection Directive, among others. The Firm was the victim of a cyberattack in 2014 that compromised user contact information for certain customers. For more information relating to this cyberattack, see Operational Risk Management on pages 141143 . The Bank Secrecy Act: The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires all financial institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers, to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA includes a variety of record-keeping and reporting requirements (such as cash transaction and suspicious activity reporting), as well as due diligence/know-your-customer documentation requirements. The Firm has established a global anti-money laundering program in order to comply with BSA requirements. In January 2013, the Firm entered into Consent Orders with its banking regulators relating to the Firms Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering policies, procedures and controls; the Firm has taken significant steps to modify and enhance its processes and controls with respect to its Anti-Money Laundering procedures and to remediate the issues identified in the Consent Order. Anti-Corruption: The Firm is subject to laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others. The Firm has implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with such laws and regulations. Any failure with respect to the Firms programs in this area could subject the Firm to substantial liability and regulatory fines. For more information on a ##TABLE_START 6   ##TABLE_ENDcurrent investigation relating to, among other things, the Firm's hiring of persons referred by government officials and clients, see Note 31. Compensation practices: The Firms compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as other agencies. The Federal Reserve has issued guidance jointly with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed to ensure that incentive compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the organizations safety and soundness. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve, must issue regulations requiring covered financial institutions, including the Firm, to report the structure of all of their incentive-based compensation arrangements and prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing compensation that is excessive or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. The Federal Reserve has conducted a review of the incentive compensation policies and practices of a number of large banking institutions, including the Firm, and the supervisory findings of such review are incorporated in the Firms supervisory ratings. In addition to the Federal Reserve, the Financial Stability Board has agreed standards covering compensation principles for banks. In Europe, the Fourth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) includes compensation provisions. In the U.K., compensation standards are governed by the Remuneration Code of the PRA and the FCA. The implementation of the Federal Reserves and other banking regulators guidelines regarding compensation are expected to evolve over the next several years, and may affect the manner in which the Firm structures its compensation. Significant international regulatory initiatives: The EU operates a European Systemic Risk Board which monitors financial stability, together with a framework of European Supervisory Agencies which oversees the regulation of financial institutions across the 28 Member States. The EU has also created a Single Supervisory Mechanism for the euro-zone, under which the regulation of all banks in that zone will be under the auspices of the European Central Bank, together with a Single Resolution Mechanism and Single Resolution Board, having jurisdiction over bank resolution in the zone. In addition, the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (G-20) formed the FSB. At both G-20 and EU levels, various proposals are under consideration to address risks associated with global financial institutions. Some of the initiatives adopted include increased capital requirements for certain trading instruments or exposures and compensation limits on certain employees located in affected countries. In the EU, there is an extensive and complex program of final and proposed regulatory enhancement which reflects, in part, the EUs commitments to policies of the G-20 together with other plans specific to the EU. This program includes EMIR, which will require, among other things, the central clearing of standardized derivatives and which will be phased in by 2015; and MiFID II, which gives effect to the G-20 commitment to trading of derivatives through central clearing houses and exchanges and also includes significantly enhanced requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency and a significant reconfiguration of the regulatory supervision of execution venues. The EU is also currently considering or executing upon significant revisions to laws covering: depositary activities; credit rating activities; resolution of banks, investment firms and market infrastructures; anti-money-laundering controls; data security and privacy; and corporate governance in financial firms, together with implementation in the EU of the Basel III capital standards. Following the issuance of the Report of the High Level Expert Group on Reforming the Structure of the EU Banking Sector (the Liikanen Group), the EU has proposed legislation providing for a proprietary trading ban and mandatory separation of other trading activities within certain banks, while various EU Member States have separately enacted similar measures. In the U.K., the Independent Commission on Banking (the Vickers Commission) proposed certain provisions, which have now been enacted by Parliament and upon which detailed implementing requirements are expected to be finalized during 2015, that mandate the separation (or ring-fencing) of deposit-taking activities from securities trading and other analogous activities within banks, subject to certain exemptions. The legislation includes the supplemental recommendation of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards (the Tyrie Commission) that such ring-fences should be electrified by the imposition of mandatory forced separation on banking institutions that are deemed to test the limits of the safeguards. Parallel but distinct provisions have been enacted by the French and German governments, and others are under consideration in other countries. These measures may separately or taken together have significant implications for the Firms organizational structure in Europe, as well as its permitted activities and capital deployment in the EU. ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I Item 1A: RISK FACTORS The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Regulatory Risk JPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated industry, and the Firms businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which the Firm is subject. As a global financial services firm, JPMorgan Chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the U.S. and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business. These laws and regulations significantly affect the way that the Firm does business, and can restrict the scope of the Firms existing businesses, limit the Firms ability to expand the products and services that it offers or make its products and services more expensive for clients and customers. The financial services industry continues to experience an unprecedented increase in regulations and supervision, and such changes could have a significant impact on how the Firm conducts business. Significant and comprehensive new legislation and regulations affecting the financial services industry have been adopted or proposed in recent years, both in the U.S. and globally. The Firm continues to make appropriate adjustments to its business and operations, legal entity structure and capital and liquidity management policies, procedures and controls to comply with these new laws and regulations. However, the cumulative effect of all of the new and proposed legislation and regulations on the Firms business, operations and profitability remains uncertain. The recent legislative and regulatory developments, as well as future legislative or regulatory actions in the U.S. and in the other countries in which the Firm operates, and any required changes to the Firms business or operations resulting from such developments and actions, could result in a significant loss of revenue for the Firm, impose additional compliance and other costs on the Firm or otherwise reduce the Firms profitability, limit the products and services that the Firm offers or its ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging, require the Firm to dispose of or curtail certain businesses, affect the value of assets that the Firm holds, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, or otherwise adversely affect the Firms businesses. Non-U.S. regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the U.S., which could create increased compliance and other costs and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases business, operations or profitability. There can be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in different countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, recent EU legislative and regulatory initiatives, including those relating to the resolution of financial institutions, the proposed separation of trading activities from core banking services, mandatory on-exchange trading, position limits and reporting rules for derivatives, conduct of business requirements and restrictions on compensation, could require the Firm to make significant modifications to its non-U.S. business, operations and legal entity structure in order to comply with these requirements. These differences in implemented or proposed non-U.S. regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the U.S., which could subject the Firm to increased compliance and legal costs, as well as higher operational, capital and liquidity costs, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Firms business, results of operations and profitability. Expanded regulatory and governmental oversight of JPMorgan Chases businesses will continue to increase the Firms costs and risks. The Firms businesses and operations are increasingly subject to heightened governmental and regulatory oversight and scrutiny. The Firm has paid significant fines (or has provided significant monetary and other relief) to resolve a number of investigations or enforcement actions by governmental agencies. In addition, the Firm continues to devote substantial resources to satisfying the requirements of regulatory consent orders and other settlements to which it is subject, including enhancing its procedures and controls, expanding its risk and control functions within its lines of business, investing in technology and hiring significant numbers of additional risk, control and compliance personnel, all of which have increased the Firms operational and compliance costs. If the Firm fails to meet the requirements of the regulatory settlements to which it is subject, or more generally, to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators and other government agencies, it could be required to enter into further orders and settlements, pay additional fines, penalties or judgments, or accept material regulatory restrictions on its businesses. The extent of the Firms exposure to legal and regulatory matters may be unpredictable and could, in some cases, substantially exceed the amount of reserves that the Firm has established for such matters. The Firm expects that it and the financial services industry as a whole will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions and that violations of law will more frequently be met with formal and punitive enforcement action, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than with informal supervisory action. ##TABLE_START 8   ##TABLE_ENDIn addition, certain regulators have announced policies, or taken measures in connection with specific enforcement actions, which make it more likely that the Firm and other financial institutions may be required to admit wrongdoing in connection with settling such matters. Such admissions can lead to, among other things, greater exposure in civil litigation and reputational harm. Finally, U.S. government officials have indicated and demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions, and have increasingly sought, and obtained, resolutions that include criminal pleas from those institutions. Such resolutions can have significant collateral consequences for a subject financial institution, including loss of customers and business and (absent the forbearance of, or the granting of waivers by, applicable regulators) the inability to offer certain products or services or operate certain businesses for a period of time . Requirements for the orderly resolution of the Firm under the Dodd-Frank Act could require JPMorgan Chase to restructure or reorganize its businesses or make costly changes to its capital or funding structure. Under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act (Title I) and Federal Reserve and FDIC rules, the Firm is required to prepare and submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a detailed plan for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase  Co. and certain of its subsidiaries under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other applicable insolvency laws in the event of future material financial distress or failure. In July 2014, the Firm submitted its third Title I resolution plan to the Federal Reserve and FDIC (the 2014 plan). In August 2014, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC announced the completion of their reviews of the second round of Title I resolution plans submitted by eleven large, complex banking organizations (the first wave filers) in 2013, including the Firms Title I resolution plan submitted in 2013 (the 2013 plan). Although the agencies noted some improvements from the original plans submitted by the first wave filers in 2012, the agencies also jointly identified specific shortcomings with the 2013 resolution plans, including the Firms 2013 plan, that will need to be addressed in 2015 submissions if not already addressed in the Firms 2014 plan. In addition, the FDIC board of directors determined under Title I that the 2013 resolution plans submitted by the first wave filers, including the Firms 2013 plan, are not credible and do not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (although the Federal Reserve Board did not make such a determination). The Federal Reserve Board determined that the first wave filers must take immediate action to improve their resolvability and reflect those improvements in their 2015 submissions. If the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC were to jointly determine that the Firms Title I resolution plan, or any future update of that plan, is not credible, and the Firm is unable to remedy the identified deficiencies in a timely manner, the regulators may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on the Firm or restrictions on growth, activities or operations of the Firm, and could require the Firm to restructure, reorganize or divest businesses, legal entities, operational systems and/or intercompany transactions in ways that could materially and adversely affect the Firms operations and strategy. In addition, in order to develop a Title I resolution plan that the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC determine is credible, the Firm may need to take actions to restructure intercompany and external activities, which could result in increased funding or operational costs. In addition to the Firms plan for orderly resolution, the Firms resolution plan also recommends to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC its proposed optimal strategy to resolve the Firm under the special resolution procedure provided in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (Title II). The Firms recommendation for its optimal Title II strategy would involve a single point of entry recapitalization model in which the FDIC would use its power to create a bridge entity for JPMorgan Chase, transfer the systemically important and viable parts of the Firms business, principally the stock of JPMorgan Chase  Co.s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries, to the bridge entity, recapitalize those businesses by contributing some or all of such intercompany claims to the capital of such subsidiaries, and by exchanging debt claims against JPMorgan Chase  Co. for equity in the bridge entity. The Federal Reserve is also expected to propose rules regarding the minimum levels of unsecured long-term debt and other loss absorbing capacity that bank holding companies would be required to have issued and outstanding, as well as guidelines defining the terms of qualifying debt instruments, to ensure that adequate levels of debt are maintained at the holding company level for purposes of recapitalization. Issuing debt in the amounts that would be required under these proposed rules could lead to increased funding costs for the Firm. In addition, if the Firm were to be resolved under its recommended Title II strategy, no assurance can be given that the value of the stock of the bridge entity distributed to the holders of debt obligations of JPMorgan Chase  Co. would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or part of the principal amount of, and interest on, the debt obligations for which such stock was exchanged. Market Risk JPMorgan Chases results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by U.S. and international financial market and economic conditions. JPMorgan Chases businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions, including the liquidity of the global financial markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates and currency and commodities prices; investor sentiment; events that reduce confidence in the financial markets; inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit; the economic effects of natural disasters, severe weather conditions, outbreaks of hostilities or terrorism; monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I and other central banks; and the health of the U.S. and global economies. These conditions can affect the Firms businesses both directly and through their impact on the businesses and activities of the Firms clients and customers. In the Firms underwriting and advisory businesses, the above-mentioned factors can affect the volume of transactions that the Firm executes for its clients and customers and, therefore, the revenue that the Firm receives from fees and commissions, as well as the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the Firm. The Firm generally maintains extensive market-making positions in the fixed income, currency, commodities, credit and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients. The revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors, including the Firms success in effectively hedging its market and other risks; volatility in interest rates and equity, debt and commodities markets; interest rate and credit spreads; and the availability of liquidity in the capital markets, all of which are affected by global economic and market conditions. Certain of the Firms market-making positions could be adversely affected by the lack of pricing transparency or liquidity, which will be influenced by many of these factors. The Firm anticipates that revenue relating to its market-making businesses will continue to experience volatility, which will affect the Firms ability to realize returns from such activities and could adversely affect the Firms earnings. The fees that the Firm earns for managing third-party assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of the third-party assets that the Firm manages or holds in custody, which, in turn, could affect the Firms revenue. Macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the Firms funds or accounts. Changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the Firms balance sheet and the revenue that the Firm earns from net interest income. A low interest rate environment has and may continue to have an adverse effect on certain of the Firms businesses by compressing net interest margins, reducing the amounts that the Firm earns on its investment securities portfolio, or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights (MSR) asset, thereby reducing the Firms net interest income and other revenues. Conversely, increasing or high interest rates may result in increased funding costs, lower levels of commercial and residential loan originations and diminished returns on the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio (to the extent that the Firm is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding assets), thereby adversely affecting the Firms revenues and capital levels. The Firms consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. domestic economic conditions, including U.S. interest rates; the rate of unemployment; housing prices; the level of consumer confidence; changes in consumer spending; and the number of personal bankruptcies. If the current positive trends in the U.S. economy are not sustained, this could diminish demand for the products and services of the Firms consumer businesses, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. In addition, adverse economic conditions, such as declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment, could lead to an increase in mortgage, credit card, auto, student and other loan delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce the Firms earnings. Widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the Firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis. Credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to Firm-specific events and circumstances, but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in the Firms credit spreads will impact, positively or negatively, the Firms earnings on liabilities that are recorded at fair value. Sudden and significant volatility in the prices of securities and other assets (including loan and derivatives) may curtail the trading markets for such securities and assets, make it difficult to sell or hedge such securities and assets, adversely affect the Firms profitability, capital or liquidity, or increase the Firms funding costs. Sustained volatility in the financial markets may also negatively affect consumer or investor confidence, which could lead to lower client activity and decreased fee-based income for the Firm. Credit Risk The financial condition of JPMorgan Chases customers, clients and counterparties, particularly other financial institutions, could adversely affect the Firm. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of market-making, trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, investment managers and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Firm to credit risk and, in some cases, disputes and litigation in the event of a default by the counterparty or client. In recent years, the perceived interrelationship among financial institutions has also led to claims by other market participants and regulators that the Firm and other financial institutions have allegedly violated anti-trust or anti-competition laws by colluding to manipulate markets, prices or indices. The Firm is a market leader in providing clearing and custodial services, and also acts as a clearing and custody bank in the securities and repurchase transaction market, including the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. Many of these services expose the Firm to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client, a central counterparty (CCP) or another market participant. ##TABLE_START 10   ##TABLE_ENDAs part of providing clearing services, the Firm is a member of a number of CCPs, and may be required to pay a portion of the losses incurred by such organizations as a result of the default of other members. As a clearing member, the Firm is also exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate through the maintenance of adequate collateral. In its role as custodian bank in the securities and repurchase transaction market, the Firm can be exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients. If a client to which the Firm provides such services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the Firm may become involved in disputes and litigation with various parties, including one or more CCPs, the clients bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or involved in regulatory investigations. All of such events can increase the Firms operational and litigation costs and may result in losses if any collateral received by the Firm declines in value. During periods of market stress or illiquidity, the Firms credit risk also may be further increased when the Firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to the Firm. Further, disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and the Firm could suffer losses during such periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral. Concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses. JPMorgan Chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. As a result, the Firm regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks. The Firms efforts to diversify or hedge its credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful. In addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the Firms inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce the Firms positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but may also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on the Firms balance sheet, thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs, all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the Firms businesses. Liquidity Risk If JPMorgan Chase does not effectively manage its liquidity, its business could suffer. JPMorgan Chases liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses. Some potential conditions that could impair the Firms liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise experiencing disruption, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including, among others, commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities (SPEs) or other entities), difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets, unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, and lack of market or customer confidence in the Firm or financial markets in general. These conditions may be caused by events over which the Firm has little or no control. The widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the Firms cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity (such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, credit card receivables and other assets) during that time, and there is no assurance that these severe conditions could not occur in the future. If the Firms access to stable and low cost sources of funding, such as bank deposits, is reduced, the Firm may need to raise alternative funding which may be more expensive or of limited availability. In addition, regulations regarding the amount and types of securities that the Firm may use to satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements may also affect the Firms cost of funding. As a holding company, JPMorgan Chase  Co. relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and, consequently, its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations. These payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, loans or other payments. Several of JPMorgan Chase  Co.s principal subsidiaries are subject to dividend distribution, capital adequacy or liquidity coverage requirements or other regulatory restrictions on their ability to provide such payments. Limitations in the payments that JPMorgan Chase  Co. receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations. Regulators in some countries in which the Firm has operations have proposed legislation or regulations requiring large banks to conduct certain businesses through separate subsidiaries in those countries, and to maintain independent capital and liquidity for such subsidiaries. If adopted, these requirements could hinder the Firms ability to efficiently manage its funding and liquidity in a centralized manner. Reductions in JPMorgan Chases credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding, as well as the value of debt obligations issued by the Firm. JPMorgan Chase  Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are currently rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate both general and firm- and industry-specific factors when determining their credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, legal expenses, assumptions surrounding government support and ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries. Although the Firm closely ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I monitors and manages, to the extent it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings, there is no assurance that the Firms credit ratings will not be lowered in the future, or that any such downgrade would not occur at times of broader market instability when the Firms options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low. Furthermore, a reduction in the Firms credit ratings could reduce the Firms access to capital markets, materially increase the cost of issuing securities, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted, contractually or otherwise, to do business with or lend to the Firm, thereby curtailing the Firms business operations and reducing its profitability. In addition, any such reduction in credit ratings may increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase  Co. and its subsidiaries and, as a result, could adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations that JPMorgan Chase  Co. and its subsidiaries have issued or may issue in the future. Legal Risk JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the Firm. JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against the Firm may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Firm, which could materially and adversely affect the Firms business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to the Firm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that the Firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations. In addition, and as noted above, the Firms businesses and operations are also subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. As the regulators and other government agencies continue to examine the operations of the Firm and its subsidiaries, there is no assurance that they will not pursue additional regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against the Firm in the future. A single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions. These and other initiatives from U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities and officials may subject the Firm to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause the Firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm the Firms reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing the Firms profitability. Other Business Risks JPMorgan Chases operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary and political developments in the U.S. and around the world. JPMorgan Chases businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities and agencies. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the U.S. and the return earned on those loans and investments. Changes in Federal Reserve policies (as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of non-U.S. central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies, such as pegging the exchange rate of their currency to the currencies of others) are beyond the Firms control and may be difficult to predict, and consequently, unanticipated changes in these policies could have a negative impact on the Firms activities and results of operations. The Firms businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and market-making in securities, loans and other obligations of companies worldwide. These risks include, among others, negative effects from slowing growth rates or recessionary economic conditions, or the risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, in the countries in which such companies operate, as well as the other risks and considerations as described further below. Several of the Firms businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities. These activities can expose the Firm to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputational risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, which could adversely affect the Firms financial condition and results of operations. Further, various countries in which the Firm operates or invests, or in which the Firm may do so in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. The ongoing crisis in Russia and impact of sanctions, coupled with sharp oil price declines, a potential slowdown in the macroeconomic prospects in China, and concerns about potential economic weaknesses in the Eurozone (including the permanent resolution of the Greek bailout program), could undermine investor confidence and affect the operating environment in 2015. In some cases, concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries can cause a contraction of available credit and reduced activity among trading partners or create market volatility that could lead to market contagion affecting other countries in the same ##TABLE_START 12   ##TABLE_ENDregion or beyond the region. Accordingly, it is possible that economic disruptions in certain countries, even in countries in which the Firm does not conduct business or have operations or engages in only limited activities, will adversely affect the Firm. JPMorgan Chases operations in emerging markets may be hindered by local political, social and economic factors, and will be subject to additional compliance costs and risks. Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its wholesale businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the U.S. and other developed markets in which the Firm currently operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, or low or negative growth, among other negative conditions, or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment. In addition, these countries have historically been more susceptible to unfavorable political, social or economic developments which have in the past resulted in, and may in the future lead to, social unrest, general strikes and demonstrations, outbreaks of hostilities, overthrow of incumbent governments, terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord, all of which can adversely affect the Firms operations or investments in such countries. Political, social or economic disruption or dislocation in certain countries or regions in which the Firm conducts its wholesale businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations. Less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the Firms operations in those countries, including, among others, the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions; the promulgation of conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations; uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations; difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive; and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions. Revenue from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations, as well as due to governmental actions including expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, and changes in laws and regulations. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets. Also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can affect, and in the past conditions of these types have affected, the Firms operations and investments in another country or countries, including the Firms operations in the U.S. As a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the Firms business and results of operations. Conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the Firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. There can be no assurance that the Firm will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems. In addition, the Firm can also incur higher costs, and face greater compliance risks, in structuring and operating its businesses outside the U.S. to comply with U.S. anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. JPMorgan Chase relies on the integrity of its operating systems and employees, and those of third parties, and certain failures of such systems or misconduct by such employees could materially and adversely affect the Firms operations. JPMorgan Chases businesses are dependent on the Firms ability to process, record and monitor an increasingly large number of complex transactions and to do so on a faster and more frequent basis. The Firms front- and back-office trading systems similarly rely on their access to, and on the functionality of, the operating systems maintained by third parties such as clearing and payment systems, central counterparties, securities exchanges and data processing and technology companies. If the Firms financial, accounting, trading or other data processing systems, or the operating systems of third parties on which the Firms businesses are dependent, are unable to meet these increasingly demanding standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Firm could be materially and adversely affected. The Firm is similarly dependent on its employees. The Firm could be materially and adversely affected if one or more of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the Firms operations or systems. In addition, when the Firm changes processes or introduces new products and services and new remote connectivity solutions (including Internet and mobile banking services), the Firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Any of these occurrences could diminish the Firms ability to operate one or more of its businesses, or result in potential liability to clients and customers, increased operating expenses, higher litigation costs (including fines and sanctions), reputational damage, regulatory ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I intervention or weaker competitive standing, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Firm. Third parties with which the Firm does business, as well as retailers and other third parties with which the Firms customers do business, can also be sources of operational risk to the Firm, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the Firms security and control systems, such as through the use of the internet, personal smart phones and other mobile services. Security breaches affecting the Firms customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties, may require the Firm to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Firm or its customers, thereby increasing the Firms operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the Firms possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Firm could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either through the fault of the Firms systems, employees or counterparties, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties. The Firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the Firms control, which may include, for example, security breaches (as discussed further below); electrical or telecommunications outages; failures of computer servers or other damage to the Firms property or assets; natural disasters or severe weather conditions; health emergencies or pandemics; or events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. JPMorgan Chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure that the Firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. While the Firm believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate, there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the Firm or its customers and clients. Any failures or disruptions of the Firms systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients, adversely affect the Firms business and results of operations by subjecting the Firm to losses or liability, or require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption, as well as by exposing the Firm to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance. A breach in the security of JPMorgan Chases systems could disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the Firm. Although JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Firms computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Firm and its customers and clients, there is no assurance that all of the Firms security measures will provide absolute security. JPMorgan Chase and other companies have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, including through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. A cyberattack against the Firm in 2014 resulted in customer and internal data of the Firm being compromised. The Firm is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious code and viruses, and has also experienced several significant distributed denial-of-service attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties which were intended to disrupt online banking services. Despite the Firms efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, it is possible that the Firm may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to its systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Firm such as persons who are associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of the Firms systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Firms data or that of its customers or clients. These risks may increase in the future as the Firm continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the Firms systems could cause serious negative consequences for the Firm, including significant disruption of the Firms operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Firm or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Firm and those of its customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Firm or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Firms security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to the Firms reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Firm. ##TABLE_START 14   ##TABLE_ENDRisk Management JPMorgan Chases framework for managing risks and its risk management procedures and practices may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to the Firm, thereby resulting in losses. JPMorgan Chases risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the Firm. The Firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which the Firm is subject. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the Firms risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that the Firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified. Any lapse in the Firms risk management framework and governance structure or other inadequacies in the design or implementation of the Firms risk management framework, governance, procedures or practices could, individually or in the aggregate, cause unexpected losses for the Firm, materially and adversely affect the Firms financial condition and results of operations, require significant resources to remediate any risk management deficiency, attract heightened regulatory scrutiny, expose the Firm to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings, subject the Firm to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firms reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence. The Firms products, including loans, leases, lending commitments, derivatives, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale, as well as cash management and clearing activities, expose the Firm to credit risk. As one of the nations largest lenders, the Firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties, and the credit quality of the Firms exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings. The Firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses inherent in its credit exposure, including unfunded lending-related commitments. The Firm also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the Firm in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to the Firms financial results and condition, and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the Firms borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the possibility that the Firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the Firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies. JPMorgan Chases market-making businesses may expose the Firm to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause the Firm to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument such as a derivative. Certain of the Firms derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that the Firm does not own; if the Firm is unable to obtain such securities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery, this could cause the Firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays, which could damage the Firms reputation and ability to transact future business. In addition, in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis, the Firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, the Firm may be exposed to market and operational losses. In particular, disputes regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts could arise, which could force the Firm to incur unexpected costs, including transaction, legal and litigation costs, and impair the Firms ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products. In a difficult or less liquid market environment, the Firms risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for the Firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants. Many of the Firms risk management strategies or techniques have a basis in historical market behavior, and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on managements subjective judgment. For example, many models used by the Firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements. These sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited and could again limit the effectiveness of the Firms risk management strategies, causing the Firm to incur losses. Many of the models used by the Firm are subject to review not only by the Firms Model Risk function but also by the Firms regulators in order that the Firm may utilize such models in connection with the Firms calculations of market risk risk-weighted assets (RWA), credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under the Advanced Approach of Basel III. The Firm may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit its ability to expand its businesses, if such models do not receive approval by its regulators. In addition, the Firm must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with vendors and other third parties that provide services to the Firm. These requirements apply to the Firm both under general guidance issued by its banking regulators and, more specifically, under certain of the consent orders to which the Firm is subject. The Firm has incurred and expects to ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships. Failure by the Firm to appropriately assess and manage third party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could result in potential liability to clients and customers, fines, penalties or judgments imposed by the Firms regulators, increased operating expenses and harm to the Firms reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Firm. Lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the Firms operations, profitability or reputation. There can be no assurance that the Firms disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect the Firms business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose the Firm to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject it to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firms reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence. Other Risks The financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chases inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations. JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment, and the Firm expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors of the Firm include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, investment managers, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and Internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading and payment processing. The Firms businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firms products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the Firms products and services or may cause the Firm to lose market share. Increased competition also may require the Firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses in order to remain competitive. These investments may increase expense or may require the Firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger, more competitive transactions. The Firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations. Competitors of the Firms non-U.S. wholesale businesses are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. For example, the regulatory objectives underlying several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the prohibition on proprietary trading under the Volcker Rule, have not been embraced by governments and regulatory agencies outside the U.S. and may not be implemented into law in most countries. The more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to U.S. financial services institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase, can put the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to its non-U.S. competitors, including prohibiting the Firm from engaging in certain transactions, imposing higher capital requirements on the Firm, making the Firms pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the Firms cost structure for providing certain products, all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the Firms wholesale businesses. JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success. JPMorgan Chases employees are the Firms most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The Firm endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees. The Firm also seeks to retain a pipeline of senior employees with superior talent, augmented from time to time by external hires, to provide continuity of succession for the Firms Operating Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer position, and senior positions below the Operating Committee. The Firm regularly reviews candidates for senior management positions to assess whether they currently are ready for a next-level role. In addition, the Firms Board of Directors is deeply involved in succession planning, including review of the succession plans for the Chief Executive Officer and the members of the Operating Committee. If for any reason the Firm were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer or members of the Operating Committee, the Firms performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected. JPMorgan Chases financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP), JPMorgan Chase is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial ##TABLE_START 16   ##TABLE_ENDstatements, including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation, among other items. Certain of the Firms financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, available-for-sale securities, certain loans, MSRs, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Firms financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Firms financial statements are incorrect, the Firm may experience material losses. Damage to JPMorgan Chases reputation could damage its businesses. Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to the Firms ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. Damage to the Firms reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the Firms business and prospects. Harm to the Firms reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, security breaches, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. The Firms reputation could also be harmed by the failure of an affiliate, joint-venturer or merchant banking portfolio company, or a vendor or other third party with which the Firm does business, to comply with laws or regulations. In addition, a failure or perceived failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, to treat customers and clients fairly, or to handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to the Firms reputation. Adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding the Firm, whether or not true, may result in harm to the Firms prospects. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the Firms reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms during the financial crisis, including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions, has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole. Should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the Firms reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the Firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm could not adversely affect the Firms earnings and results of operations, or that damage to the Firms reputation will not impair the Firms ability to retain its existing or attract new customers, investors and employees. Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the Firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among the Firms clients. The failure or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the Firm, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions, as well as cause serious reputational harm to the Firm.

The 2013 framework, which provides guidance for designing, implementing and conducting internal control and assessing its effectiveness, updates the original COSO framework, which was published in 1992. The Firm used the 2013 COSO framework to assess the effectiveness of the Firms internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 . See Managements report on internal control over financial reporting on page 170 . As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firms management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls in the future. For further information, see Managements report on internal control over financial reporting on page 170 . There was no change in the Firms internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended  December 31, 2014 , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firms internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START 20   ##TABLE_END", "9B": " ITEM 9B: OTHER INFORMATION Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. Except as set forth below, as of the date of this report, the Firm is not aware of any other activity, transaction or dealing by any of its affiliates during the year ended December 31, 2014 that requires disclosure under Section 219. Carlson Wagonlit Travel (CWT), a business travel management firm in which JPMorgan Chase had invested through its merchant banking activities, may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Firm, as that term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. CWT informed the Firm that, during the period January 1, 2014 through August 15, 2014 (the date on which the Firm sold its investment in CWT), CWT booked approximately 2 flights (of the approximately 37 million transactions it booked during the period) to Iran on Iran Air for passengers, including employees of foreign governments and/or non-governmental organizations. Both flights originated outside of the U.S. from countries that permit travel to Iran, and none of such passengers were persons designated under Executive Orders 13224 or 13382 or were employees of foreign governments that are targets of U.S. sanctions. CWT and the Firm believe that this activity is permissible pursuant to certain exemptions from U.S. sanctions for travel-related transactions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as amended. CWT had approximately $5,000 in gross revenues attributable to these transactions. In addition, during 2014, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. processed one payment from Iran Air on behalf of a U.S. client into such clients account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Iran Air is designated pursuant to Executive Order 13382. This transaction was authorized by and conducted pursuant to a license from the Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. charged a fee of US$ 3.50 for this transaction. Iran Air overpaid such U.S. client when it made the initial payment to the client. Therefore, upon its U.S. clients request, the Firm transferred the overpayment back to Iran Air in the fourth quarter of 2014 and charged a fee of US$ 5.50 for the transfer. As with the initial transaction, the transfer of the overpayment to Iran Air was authorized by and conducted pursuant to an OFAC license.

The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands, the Firm serves millions of customers in the U.S. and many of the worlds most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients. JPMorgan Chases principal bank subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), a national banking association with U.S. branches in 23 states, and Chase Bank USA, National Association (Chase Bank USA, N.A.), a national banking association that is the Firms credit card-issuing bank. JPMorgan Chases principal nonbank subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMorgan Securities), the Firms U.S. investment banking firm. The bank and nonbank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase operate nationally as well as through overseas branches and subsidiaries, representative offices and subsidiary foreign banks. One of the Firms principal operating subsidiaries in the United Kingdom (U.K.) is J.P. Morgan Securities plc, a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Firms website is www.jpmorganchase.com. JPMorgan Chase makes available free of charge, through its website, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). The Firm has adopted, and posted on its website, a Code of Conduct for all employees of the Firm and a Code of Ethics for its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and all other professionals of the Firm worldwide serving in a finance, accounting, tax or investor relations role. Business segments JPMorgan Chases activities are organized, for management reporting purposes, into four major reportable business segments, as well as a Corporate  segment. The Firms consumer business is the Consumer  Community Banking (CCB) segment. The Firms wholesale business segments are Corporate  Investment Bank (CIB), Commercial Banking (CB), and Asset Management (AM). A description of the Firms business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases is provided in the Business segment results section of Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MDA), beginning on page 68 and in Note 33. Competition JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in a highly competitive environment. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, investment managers, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, financial technology companies, and other companies engaged in providing similar products and services. The Firms businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firms products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. With respect to some of its geographies and products, JPMorgan Chase competes globally; with respect to others, the Firm competes on a national or regional basis. The Firms ability to compete also depends on its ability to attract and retain professional and other personnel, and on its reputation. It is likely that competition in the financial services industry will become even more intense as the Firms businesses continue to compete with other financial institutions that may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies or that operate under different rules and regulatory regimes than the Firm, or with companies that provide new or innovative products or services that the Firm is unable to provide. Supervision and regulation The Firm is subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as well as the applicable laws of each of the various jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business. As a result of regulatory reforms enacted and proposed in the U.S. and abroad, the Firm has been experiencing a period of significant change in regulation which has had and could continue to have significant consequences for how the Firm conducts business. The Firm continues to work diligently in assessing the regulatory changes it is facing, and is devoting substantial resources to comply with all the new regulations, while, at the same time, endeavoring to best meet the needs and expectations of its customers, clients and shareholders. These efforts include the implementation of new policies, procedures and controls, and appropriate adjustments to the Firms business and operations, legal entity structure and capital and liquidity ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I management. The combined effect of numerous rule-makings by multiple governmental agencies and regulators, and the potential conflicts or inconsistencies among such rules, present challenges and risks to the Firms business and operations. Given the current status of the regulatory developments, the Firm cannot currently quantify all of the possible effects on its business and operations of the significant changes that are underway. For more information, see Risk Factors on pages 818 . Financial holding company: Consolidated supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) . As a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company, JPMorgan Chase is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve acts as an umbrella regulator and certain of JPMorgan Chases subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional authorities based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries. For example, JPMorgan Chases national bank subsidiaries, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Chase Bank USA, N.A., are subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and, with respect to certain matters, by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC). Certain non-bank subsidiaries, such as the Firms U.S. broker-dealers, are subject to supervision and regulation by the SEC, and subsidiaries of the Firm that engage in certain futures-related and swaps-related activities are subject to supervision and regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). See Securities and broker-dealer regulation, Investment management regulation and Derivatives regulation below. In addition, the Firms consumer activities are subject to supervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and to regulation under various state statutes which are enforced by the respective states Attorney General. Scope of permissible business activities. The Bank Holding Company Act generally restricts BHCs from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities. Financial holding companies generally can engage in a broader range of financial activities than are otherwise permissible for BHCs, including underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities, and making merchant banking investments in non-financial companies. The Federal Reserve has the authority to limit a financial holding companys ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible if the financial holding company or any of its depositary institution subsidiaries ceases to meet the applicable eligibility requirements (including requirements that the financial holding company and each of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries maintain their status as well-capitalized and well-managed). The Federal Reserve may also impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may, for example, require divestiture of the holding companys depository institutions if the deficiencies persist. Federal regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies. In addition, a financial holding company must obtain Federal Reserve approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both in the U.S. and internationally, as further described under Regulation of acquisitions below. Activities restrictions under the Volcker Rule. Section 619 of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) (the Volcker Rule) prohibits banking entities , including the Firm, from engaging in certain proprietary trading activities, subject to exceptions for underwriting, market-making, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. In addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, covered funds (as defined by the Volcker Rule) and imposes limits on certain transactions between the Firm and its sponsored funds (see JPMorgan Chases subsidiary banks  Restrictions on transactions with affiliates below). The Volcker Rule, which became effective in July 2015, requires banking entities to establish comprehensive compliance programs reasonably designed to help ensure and monitor compliance with the restrictions under the Volcker Rule, including, in order to distinguish permissible from impermissible risk-taking activities, the measurement, monitoring and reporting of certain key metrics.  Given the uncertainty and complexity of the Volcker Rules framework, the full impact of the Volcker Rule will ultimately depend on its ongoing interpretation by the five regulatory agencies responsible for its oversight.  Capital and liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve establishes capital and leverage requirements for the Firm and evaluates its compliance with such requirements. The OCC establishes similar capital and leverage requirements for the Firms national banking subsidiaries. For more information about the applicable requirements relating to risk-based capital and leverage in the U.S. under the most recent capital framework established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee)(Basel III), see Capital Management on pages 149158 and Note 28. Under Basel III, bank holding companies and banks are required to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests: the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). The U.S. banking regulators have approved the final LCR rule (U.S. LCR), which became effective on January 1, 2015. A proposed U.S. rule for NSFR is expected. For additional information on these ratios, see Liquidity Risk Management on pages 159164 . It is likely that the banking supervisors will continue to refine and enhance the Basel III capital framework for financial institutions. The Basel Committee recently finalized revisions to market risk capital for trading books; other proposals being contemplated by the Basel Committee include revisions to, among others, standardized credit and operational risk capital frameworks and revisions ##TABLE_START 2   ##TABLE_ENDto the securitization framework. After a proposal is finalized by the Basel Committee, U.S. banking regulators would then need to propose requirements applicable to U.S. financial institutions. Stress tests. The Federal Reserve has adopted supervisory stress tests for large bank holding companies, including JPMorgan Chase, which form part of the Federal Reserves annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) framework. Under the framework, the Firm must conduct semi-annual company-run stress tests and, in addition, must submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by the Firm and the Federal Reserve. In reviewing the Firms capital plan, the Federal Reserve considers both quantitative and qualitative factors. Qualitative assessments include (among other things) the comprehensiveness of the plan, the assumptions and analysis underlying the plan, and the extent to which the Firm has satisfied certain supervisory matters related to the Firms processes and analyses, including the design and operational effectiveness of the controls governing such processes. Moreover, the Firm is required to receive a notice of non-objection from the Federal Reserve before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to perform separate, similar annual stress tests. The Firm publishes each year the results of its mid-cycle stress tests under the Firms internally-developed severely adverse scenario and the results of its (and its two primary subsidiary banks) annual stress tests under the supervisory severely adverse scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. Commencing with the 2016 CCAR, the annual CCAR submission will be due on April 5. Results will be published by the Federal Reserve by June 30, with disclosures of results by BHCs, including the Firm, to follow within 15 days. Also commencing in 2016, the mid-cycle capital stress test submissions will be due on October 5 and BHCs, including the Firm, will publish results by November 4. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it is currently evaluating the inclusion of all or part of the global systemically important bank (GSIB) surcharge into the 2017 CCAR test and the Firm is currently awaiting further guidance. For additional information on the Firms CCAR, see Capital Management on pages 149158 . Enhanced prudential standards. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), among other things, recommends prudential standards and reporting and disclosure requirements to the Federal Reserve for systemically important financial institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve has adopted several rules to implement the heightened prudential standards, including final rules relating to risk management and corporate governance of subject BHCs. BHCs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets are required to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, including a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days, and their board of directors is required to conduct appropriate oversight of their risk management activities. For information on liquidity measures, see Liquidity Risk Management on pages 159164 . Several additional proposed rules are still being considered, including rules relating to single-counterparty credit limits and an early remediation framework to address financial distress or material management weaknesses. Risk reporting. In January 2013, the Basel Committee issued new regulations relating to risk aggregation and reporting. Under these regulations, the banking institutions risk governance framework must encompass risk-data aggregation and reporting, and data aggregation must be highly automated and allow for minimal manual intervention. The regulations also impose higher standards for the accuracy, comprehensiveness, granularity and timely distribution of data reporting, and call for regular supervisory review of the banking institutions risk aggregation and reporting. These new standards became effective for GSIBs, including the Firm, on January 1, 2016. Orderly liquidation authority and resolution and recovery. As a BHC with assets of $50 billion or more, the Firm is required to submit annually to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for resolution under the Bankruptcy Code in the event of material distress or failure (a resolution plan). The FDIC also requires each insured depositary institution with $50 billion or more in assets, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., to provide a resolution plan. For more information about the Firms resolution plan, see Risk Factors on pages 818 . In addition, certain financial companies, including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its subsidiaries, can be subjected to resolution under an orderly liquidation authority. The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States, must first make certain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk determinations, and action must be recommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent such actions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain subject to resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. In December 2013, the FDIC issued a draft policy statement describing its single point of entry strategy for resolution of systemically important financial institutions under the orderly liquidation authority. This strategy seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of the BHC open and impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the holding company in receivership according to their statutory order of priority. The Firm has a comprehensive recovery plan detailing the actions it would take to avoid failure by remaining well-capitalized and well-funded in the case of an adverse event. JPMorgan Chase has provided the Federal Reserve with comprehensive confidential supervisory information and analyses about the Firms businesses, legal entities and corporate governance and about its crisis management governance, capabilities and available alternatives to raise liquidity and capital in severe market circumstances. The ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I OCC has published for comment proposed guidelines establishing standards for recovery planning by insured national banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. Regulators in the U.S. and abroad continue to be focused on developing measures designed to address the possibility or perception that large financial institutions, including the Firm, may be too big to fail, and to provide safeguards so that, if a large financial institution does fail, it can be resolved without the use of public funds. Higher capital surcharges on GSIBs, requirements for certain large bank holding companies to maintain a minimum amount of long-term debt to facilitate orderly resolution of those firms, and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) protocol relating to the close-out of derivatives transactions during the resolution of a large cross-border financial institution, are examples of initiatives to address too big to fail. For further information on the potential impact of the GSIB framework and Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC), see Capital Management on pages 149158 and Risk Factors on pages 818 , and on the ISDA close-out protocol, see Derivatives regulation below. Holding company as source of strength for bank subsidiaries . JPMorgan Chase  Co. is required to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the Federal Reserve at times when the Firm might otherwise determine not to provide it. Regulation of acquisitions. Acquisitions by bank holding companies and their banks are subject to multiple requirements by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. For example, financial holding companies and bank holding companies are required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before they may acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of an unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by financial companies are prohibited if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies. In contrast, because the liabilities of non-U.S. financial companies are calculated differently under this rule, a non-U.S. financial company could hold significantly more than 10% of the U.S. market without exceeding the concentration limit. In addition, for certain acquisitions, the Firm must provide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company with over $10 billion in assets that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature. JPMorgan Chases subsidiary banks: The Firms two primary subsidiary banks, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., are FDIC-insured national banks regulated by the OCC. As national banks , the activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. are limited to those specifically authorized under the National Bank Act and related interpretations by the OCC.  FDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance fund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, which is funded through assessments on banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. Changes in the methodology used to calculate such assessments, resulting from the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, significantly increased the assessments that the Firms bank subsidiaries pay annually to the FDIC. In October 2015, the FDIC proposed a new assessment surcharge on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion in order to raise the reserve ratio for the FDIC deposit insurance fund. Future FDIC rule-making could further increase such assessments.  FDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC may be appointed as the conservator or receiver under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA).  In addition,  where a systemically important financial institution, such as JPMorgan Chase  Co., is in default or in danger of default, the FDIC may be appointed as receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation. In both cases, the FDIC has broad powers to transfer any assets and liabilities without the approval of the institutions creditors.  Cross-guarantee. An FDIC-insured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the FDIC if another FDIC-insured institution that is under common control with such institution is in default or is deemed to be in danger of default (commonly referred to as cross-guarantee liability). An FDIC cross-guarantee claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution.  Prompt corrective action and early remediation. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. While these regulations apply only to banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. , the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against the parent BHC, such as JPMorgan Chase  Co., based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In certain instances, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary.  OCC Heightened Standards. The OCC has issued final regulations and guidelines establishing heightened standards for large banks. The guidelines establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks. While the bank may use certain components of the parent companys risk governance framework, the framework must ensure that the banks risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from the parent for risk management purposes. The banks board or risk committee is responsible for approving the ##TABLE_START 4   ##TABLE_ENDbanks risk governance framework, providing active oversight of the banks risk-taking activities and holding management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework.  Restrictions on transactions with affiliates.  The bank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase (including subsidiaries of those banks) are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, investments in stock or securities of, and derivatives, securities lending and certain other transactions with, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and certain other affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan Chase  Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from such subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts and comply with certain other requirements. For more information, see Note 27. In addition, the Volcker Rule imposes a prohibition on such transactions between any JPMorgan Chase entity and covered funds for which a JPMorgan Chase entity serves as the investment manager, investment advisor, commodity trading advisor or sponsor, as well as, subject to a limited exception, any covered fund controlled by such funds.  Dividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. See Note 27 for the amount of dividends that the Firms principal bank subsidiaries could pay, at January 1, 2016, to their respective bank holding companies without the approval of their banking regulators.  In addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the OCC and the Federal Reserve have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends of the bank subsidiaries they supervise, if, in the banking regulators opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank.  Depositor preference. Under federal law, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC) have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including public noteholders and depositors in non-U.S. offices. As a result, such persons could receive substantially less than the depositors in U.S. offices of the depository institution. The U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (the PRA), a subsidiary of the Bank of England which has responsibility for prudential regulation of banks and other systemically important institutions, has issued a proposal that may require the Firm to either obtain equal treatment for U.K. depositors or subsidiarize in the U.K. In September 2013, the FDIC issued a final rule which clarifies that foreign deposits are considered deposits under the FDIA if they are payable in the U.S. as well as in the foreign branch. CFPB regulation and supervision, and other consumer regulations. JPMorgan Chase and its national bank subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. , are subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. These laws include the Truth-in-Lending, Equal Credit Opportunity (ECOA), Fair Credit Reporting, Fair Debt Collection Practice, Electronic Funds Transfer, Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) and Home Mortgage Disclosure Acts. The CFPB also has authority to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service. The CFPB has issued informal guidance on a variety of topics (such as the collection of consumer debts and credit card marketing practices) and has taken enforcement actions against certain financial institutions. Much of the CFPBs initial rule-making efforts have addressed mortgage related topics, including ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requirements, appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higher-priced mortgages. Other areas of recent focus include pre-authorized electronic funds transfers, add-on products, matters involving consumer populations considered vulnerable by the CFPB (such as students), credit reporting, and the furnishing of credit scores to individuals. The CFPB has been focused on automobile dealer discretionary interest rate markups, and on holding the Firm and other purchasers of such contracts (indirect lenders) responsible under the ECOA for statistical disparities in markups charged by the dealers to borrowers of different races or ethnicities . For information regarding a current investigation relating to indirect lending to automobile dealers, see Note 31. Securities and broker-dealer regulation: The Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and other broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations of the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the New York Stock Exchange, among others. The Firm conducts similar securities activities outside the U.S. subject to local regulatory requirements. In the U.K., those activities are conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc, which is regulated by the PRA and by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates prudential matters for firms that are not so regulated by the PRA and conduct matters for all market participants. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customers funds, the financing of clients purchases, capital structure, record-keeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers and employees. For information on the net capital of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Clearing Corp., and the applicable requirements relating to risk-based capital for J.P. Morgan Securities plc, see Broker-dealer regulatory capital on page 158 . Future rule-making under ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I the Dodd-Frank Act and rules proposed by the Department of Labor may impose (among other things) a new standard of care applicable to broker-dealers when dealing with customers. Investment management regulation: The Firms investment management business is subject to significant regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding of client assets, offerings of funds, marketing activities, transactions among affiliates and management of client funds. Certain of the Firms subsidiaries are registered with, and subject to oversight by, the SEC as investment advisers. As such, the Firms registered investment advisers are subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as various state securities laws. For information regarding investigations and litigation in connection with disclosures to clients related to proprietary products, see Note 31. The Firms asset management business continues to be affected by ongoing rule-making. In July 2013, the SEC adopted amendments to rules that govern money-market funds, requiring a floating net asset value for institutional prime money-market funds, effective October 14, 2016. As noted above, the Department of Labor has also proposed a rule that would significantly expand the universe of persons viewed as investment fiduciaries to retirement plans and IRAs. In addition, the SEC has issued proposed rules regarding enhanced liquidity risk management for open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs); restrictions on the use of derivatives by mutual funds, ETFs and closed-end funds; and enhanced reporting for funds and advisors. Derivatives regulation:  The Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its derivatives businesses. The regulations impose capital and margin requirements, require central clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives, require that certain standardized over-the-counter swaps be traded on regulated trading venues, and provide for reporting of certain mandated information. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the registration of swap dealers and major swap participants with the CFTC and of security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants with the SEC. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. , J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities plc and J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corporation have registered with the CFTC as swap dealers, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. , J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc will likely be required to register with the SEC as security-based swap dealers. As a result of their registration as swap dealers or security-based swap dealers, these entities will be subject to a new, comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to their swap or security-based swap activities, which includes capital requirements, rules regulating their swap activities, rules requiring the collateralization of uncleared swaps, rules regarding segregation of counterparty collateral, business conduct and documentation standards, record-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-fraud and anti-manipulation requirements. Further, some of the rules for derivatives apply extraterritorially to U.S. firms doing business with clients outside of the U.S., as well as to the overseas activities of non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Firm that either deal with U.S. persons or that are guaranteed by U.S. subsidiaries of the Firm; however, the full scope of the extra-territorial impact of the U.S. swaps regulation has not been finalized and therefore remains unclear. The effect of these rules may require banking entities, such as the Firm, to modify the structure of their derivatives businesses and face increased operational and regulatory costs. In the European Union (the EU), the implementation of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and the revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) will result in comparable, but not identical, changes to the European regulatory regime for derivatives. The combined effect of the U.S. and EU requirements, and the potential conflicts and inconsistencies between them, present challenges and risks to the structure and operating model of the Firms derivatives businesses. In November 2015, the Firm and other financial institutions agreed to adhere to an updated Resolution Stay Protocol developed by ISDA in response to regulator concerns that the close-out of derivatives transactions during the resolution of a large cross-border financial institution could impede resolution efforts and potentially destabilize markets. The Resolution Stay Protocol provides for the contractual recognition of cross-border stays under various statutory resolution regimes and a contractual stay on certain cross-default rights. In the U.S., two subsidiaries of the Firm are registered as futures commission merchants, and other subsidiaries are either registered with the CFTC as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors or exempt from such registration. These CFTC-registered subsidiaries are also members of the National Futures Association. Data regulation: The Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations concerning the use and protection of certain customer, employee and other personal and confidential information, including those imposed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as well as the EU Data Protection Directive. In addition, there are numerous proposals pending before U.S. and non-U.S. legislative and regulatory bodies regarding privacy and data protection. For example, the European Parliament and the European Council have reached agreement on certain data protection reforms proposed by the European Commission which includes numerous operational requirements, adds a requirement to notify individuals of data breaches and establishes enhanced sanctions for non-compliance, including increased fines. ##TABLE_START 6   ##TABLE_ENDThe Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions: The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires all financial institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers, to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA includes a variety of record-keeping and reporting requirements (such as cash transaction and suspicious activity reporting), as well as due diligence/know your customer documentation requirements. In January 2013, the Firm entered into Consent Orders with its banking regulators relating to the Firms Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering policies, procedures and controls; the Firm has taken significant steps to modify and enhance its processes and controls with respect to its Anti-Money Laundering procedures and to remediate the issues identified in the Consent Order. The Firm is also subject to the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Anti-Corruption: The Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. For more information on a current investigation relating to, among other things, the Firms hiring of persons referred by government officials and clients, see Note 31. Compensation practices: The Firms compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as other agencies. The Federal Reserve has issued guidance jointly with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed to ensure that incentive compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the organizations safety and soundness. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve, must issue regulations or guidelines requiring covered financial institutions, including the Firm, to report the structure of all of their incentive-based compensation arrangements and prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing compensation that is excessive or that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. The Federal Reserve has conducted a review of the incentive compensation policies and practices of a number of large banking institutions, including the Firm. In addition to the Federal Reserve, the Financial Stability Board has established standards covering compensation principles for banks. In Europe, the Fourth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) includes compensation provisions. In the U.K., compensation standards are governed by the Remuneration Code of the PRA and the FCA. The implementation of the Federal Reserves and other banking regulators guidelines regarding compensation are expected to evolve over the next several years, and may affect the manner in which the Firm structures its compensation programs and practices. Significant international regulatory initiatives: The EU operates a European Systemic Risk Board which monitors financial stability, together with European Supervisory Agencies which set detailed regulatory rules and encourage supervisory convergence across the 28 Member States. The EU has also created a Single Supervisory Mechanism for the euro-zone, under which the regulation of all banks in that zone will be under the auspices of the European Central Bank, together with a Single Resolution Mechanism and Single Resolution Board, having jurisdiction over bank resolution in the zone. At both global and EU levels, various proposals are under consideration to address risks associated with global financial institutions. Some of the initiatives adopted include increased capital requirements for certain trading instruments or exposures and compensation limits on certain employees located in affected countries. In the EU, there is an extensive and complex program of final and proposed regulatory enhancement which reflects, in part, the EUs commitments to policies of the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (G-20) together with other plans specific to the EU. This program includes EMIR, which requires, among other things, the central clearing of standardized derivatives; and MiFID II, which gives effect to the G-20 commitment to trading of derivatives through central clearing houses and exchanges and also includes significantly enhanced requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency and a significant reconfiguration of the regulatory supervision of execution venues. The EU is also currently considering or implementing significant revisions to laws covering: depositary activities; credit rating activities; resolution of banks, investment firms and market infrastructures; anti-money-laundering controls; data security and privacy; corporate governance in financial firms; and implementation in the EU of the Basel III capital and liquidity standards. Following the issuance of the Report of the High Level Expert Group on Reforming the Structure of the EU Banking Sector (the Liikanen Group), the EU has proposed legislation providing for a proprietary trading ban and mandatory separation of other trading activities within certain banks, while various EU Member States have separately enacted similar measures. In the U.K., legislation was adopted that mandates the separation (or ring-fencing) of deposit-taking activities from securities trading and other analogous activities within banks, subject to certain exemptions. The legislation includes the supplemental recommendation of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards (the Tyrie Commission) that such ring-fences should be electrified by the imposition of mandatory forced separation on banking institutions that are deemed to test the limits of the safeguards. Parallel but distinct provisions have been enacted by the French, Belgian and German governments. These measures may separately or taken together have significant implications for the Firms organizational ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I structure in Europe, as well as its permitted activities and capital deployment in the EU. U.K. regulators are introducing a range of policy measures that make significant changes to the regulatory environment in the U.K. Alongside broader recommendations made by the Fair and Effective Markets Review which focused on fixed income currencies and commodities markets, there is a focus by U.K. regulators on raising standards and accountability of individuals, and promoting forward-looking conduct risk identification and mitigation, including by introducing the new Senior Managers and Certification Regimes. Item 1A: RISK FACTORS The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Regulatory Risk JPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated industry, and the Firms businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which the Firm is subject. As a global financial services firm, JPMorgan Chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the U.S. and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business. The financial services industry has experienced and continues to experience an unprecedented increase in regulations and supervision, both in the U.S. and globally, and the cumulative effect of all of the new and proposed legislation and regulations on the Firms business, operations and profitability remains uncertain. The recent legislative and regulatory developments, as well as future legislative or regulatory actions in the U.S. and in the other countries in which the Firm operates, and any required changes to the Firms business or operations resulting from such developments and actions, could result in a significant loss of revenue for the Firm, impose additional compliance and other costs on the Firm or otherwise reduce the Firms profitability, limit the products and services that the Firm offers or its ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging, require the Firm to dispose of or curtail certain businesses, affect the value of assets that the Firm holds, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, or otherwise adversely affect the Firms businesses. In addition, to the extent that legislative or regulatory initiatives are imposed on a limited subset of financial institutions (based on size, activities, geography or other criteria), the requirements to which the Firm may be subject under such laws and regulations could require the Firm to restructure its businesses, or re-price or curtail the products or services that it offers to customers, which could result in the Firm not being able to compete effectively with other institutions that are not impacted in the same way. In addition, there can be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in different countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, recent legislative and regulatory initiatives within the EU, including those relating to the resolution of financial institutions, the separation of trading activities from core banking services, mandatory on-exchange trading, position limits and reporting rules for derivatives, conduct of business requirements, restrictions on compensation and governance and accountability regimes, could require the Firm to make significant modifications to its non-U.S. business, operations and legal entity structure in order to comply with these requirements. These differences in implemented or proposed non-U.S. regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the U.S., which could subject the Firm to increased compliance and legal costs, as well as higher operational, capital and liquidity costs, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Firms business, results of operations and profitability. Expanded regulatory and governmental oversight of JPMorgan Chases businesses may continue to increase the Firms costs and risks. The Firms businesses and operations are increasingly subject to heightened governmental and regulatory oversight and scrutiny. The Firm has paid significant fines (or has provided significant monetary and other relief) to resolve a number of investigations or enforcement actions by governmental agencies. The Firm continues to devote substantial resources to satisfying the requirements of regulatory consent orders and other settlements to which it is subject, which increases the Firms operational and compliance costs. Certain regulators have taken measures in connection with specific enforcement actions against financial institutions (including the Firm) that require admissions of wrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection with settling such matters. Such admissions and conditions can lead to, among other things, greater exposure in civil litigation, harm to reputation, disqualification from providing business to certain clients and in certain jurisdictions, and other direct and indirect adverse effects. In addition, U.S. government officials have indicated and demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions, including the Firm, and have increasingly sought, and obtained, resolutions that include criminal pleas from those institutions, such as the Firms agreement in May 2015 to plead guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law in connection with its settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Such resolutions, whether with U.S. or non-U.S. authorities, could have significant collateral consequences for a subject financial institution, including loss of customers and business, or the inability to offer certain products or services, or losing permission to operate certain businesses, for a period of time (absent the ##TABLE_START 8   ##TABLE_ENDforbearance of, or the granting of waivers by, applicable regulators). The Firm expects that it and the financial services industry as a whole will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions and that violations of law will more frequently be met with formal and punitive enforcement action, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than with informal supervisory action. In addition, if the Firm fails to meet the requirements of the various governmental settlements to which it is subject, or more generally, to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators and other government agencies, it could be required to enter into further orders and settlements, pay additional fines, penalties or judgments, or accept material regulatory restrictions on its businesses. The extent of the Firms exposure to legal and regulatory matters may be unpredictable and could, in some cases, substantially exceed the amount of reserves that the Firm has established for such matters. Requirements for the orderly resolution of the Firm could require JPMorgan Chase to restructure or reorganize its businesses, and holders of JPMorgan Chases debt and equity securities would be at risk of absorbing losses if the Firm were to enter into a resolution. Under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act (Title I) and Federal Reserve and FDIC rules, the Firm is required to prepare and submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a detailed plan for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase  Co. and certain of its subsidiaries under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and other applicable insolvency laws in the event of future material financial distress or failure. In August 2014, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC announced the completion of their reviews of the second round of Title I resolution plans submitted by eleven large, complex banking organizations in 2013, including the Firm. The agencies jointly identified specific shortcomings with the 2013 resolution plans, including the Firms 2013 plan. The FDICs board of directors determined under Title I that the 2013 resolution plans, including the Firms 2013 plan, were not credible and did not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Federal Reserve Board determined that the eleven banking organizations must take immediate actions to improve their resolvability and reflect those improvements in their 2015 plans. The Firm has devoted significant resources to its resolution planning efforts, and believes that in its most recent Title I resolution plan submitted to the Federal Reserve and FDIC in July 2015, it has addressed, or has made substantial progress in addressing, each of the shortcomings previously identified by the agencies. However, if the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were to jointly determine that the Firms 2015 plan, or any future update of that plan, is not credible, and the Firm is unable to remedy the identified deficiencies in a timely manner, the regulators may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on the Firm or restrictions on growth, activities or operations of the Firm, and could, if such deficiencies are not remedied within two years after such a determination, require the Firm to restructure, reorganize or divest businesses, legal entities, operational systems and/or intercompany transactions in ways that could materially and adversely affect the Firms operations and strategy. In addition, in order to develop a Title I resolution plan that the Federal Reserve and FDIC determine is credible, the Firm may need to make certain changes to its legal entity structure and to certain intercompany and external activities, which could result in increased funding or operational costs. In addition to the Firms plan for orderly resolution, the Firms resolution plan also recommends to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC its proposed optimal strategy to resolve the Firm under the special resolution procedure provided in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (Title II). The Firms recommendation involves a single point of entry recapitalization model in which the FDIC would use its power to create a bridge entity for JPMorgan Chase; transfer the systemically important and viable parts of the Firms business, principally the stock of JPMorgan Chase  Co.s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries, to the bridge entity; recapitalize those subsidiaries by, among other things, converting some or all of such intercompany claims to capital; and exchange external debt claims against JPMorgan Chase  Co. for equity in the bridge entity. As discussed below, the Federal Reserve has also proposed rules regarding the minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity that bank holding companies would be required to have issued and outstanding, as well as guidelines defining the terms of qualifying debt instruments, to ensure that adequate levels of debt are maintained at the holding company level for purposes of recapitalization of the bridge entity and operating subsidiaries (eligible LTD). If JPMorgan Chase  Co. were to enter into a resolution, either in a proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Firm would be at risk of absorbing the losses of JPMorgan Chase  Co. and its affiliates. If JPMorgan Chase  Co. commenced proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, creditors and shareholders of JPMorgan Chase  Co. would realize value only to the extent available to JPMorgan Chase  Co. as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, after the payment to the creditors of such subsidiaries. In addition, even under the Firms preferred resolution strategy under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, the value of the stock of the bridge entity that would be redistributed to holders of the Firms eligible LTD and other debt securities may not be sufficient to repay all or part of the principal amount and interest on such debt. It is also possible that the application of the Firms recommended Title II strategy could result in greater losses to security holders of JPMorgan Chase  Co. than the losses that would result from a different resolution strategy for the Firm. ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I Market Risk JPMorgan Chases results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by U.S. and global financial market and economic conditions. JPMorgan Chases businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions, including the liquidity of the global financial markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates, currency and commodities prices (including oil prices) and other market indices; investor, consumer and business sentiment; events that reduce confidence in the financial markets; inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit; the economic effects of natural disasters, health emergencies or pandemics, severe weather conditions, outbreaks of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities; monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks; and the health of the U.S. and global economies. These conditions can affect the Firms businesses both directly and through their impact on the businesses and activities of the Firms clients and customers. In the Firms underwriting and advisory businesses, the above-mentioned factors can affect the volume of transactions that the Firm executes for its clients and customers and, therefore, the revenue that the Firm receives, as well as the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the Firm. The Firm generally maintains market-making positions in the fixed income, currency, commodities, credit and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients. The revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors, including the Firms success in effectively hedging its market and other risks; volatility in interest rates and equity, debt and commodities markets; interest rate and credit spreads; and the availability of liquidity in the capital markets, all of which are affected by global economic and market conditions. Certain of the Firms market-making positions could be adversely affected by the lack of liquidity, which will be influenced by many of these factors, and which could affect the Firms ability to realize returns from such activities and adversely affect the Firms earnings. The Firm may be adversely affected by declining asset values. This is particularly true for businesses that earn fees for managing third-party assets or receive or post collateral. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of the client assets that the Firm manages or holds in custody, which, in turn, could affect the Firms revenue. Macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the Firms funds or accounts or cause clients to invest funds in products that generate lower revenue. Changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the Firms balance sheet and the revenue that the Firm earns from net interest income. A low interest rate environment may compress net interest margins, reducing the amounts that the Firm earns on its investment securities portfolio, or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights (MSR) asset, thereby reducing the Firms net interest income and other revenues. Conversely, increasing or high interest rates may result in increased funding costs, lower levels of commercial and residential loan originations and diminished returns on the investment securities portfolio (to the extent that the Firm is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding assets), thereby adversely affecting the Firms revenues and capital levels. The Firms consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. domestic economic conditions, including U.S. interest rates, the rate of unemployment, housing prices, the level of consumer confidence, changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies. If the recent positive trends in the U.S. economy are not sustained, this could diminish demand for the products and services of the Firms consumer businesses, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. In addition, adverse economic conditions, such as declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment due to economic dislocations in certain geographies or industries caused by falling oil and gas prices or other market or economic factors, could lead to an increase in mortgage, credit card, auto, student and other loan delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce the Firms earnings. Widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the Firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis, and may adversely affect the credit markets and the Firms businesses. Credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to Firm-specific events and circumstances, but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in the Firms credit spreads will impact, positively or negatively, the Firms earnings on certain liabilities that are recorded at fair value. Sudden and significant volatility in the prices of securities and other assets (including loans and derivatives) may curtail the trading markets for such securities and assets, make it difficult to sell or hedge such securities and assets, adversely affect the Firms profitability, capital or liquidity, or increase the Firms funding costs. Sustained volatility in the financial markets may also negatively affect consumer or investor confidence, which could lead to lower client activity and decreased revenue for the Firm. Credit Risk The financial condition of JPMorgan Chases customers, clients and counterparties, particularly other financial institutions, could adversely affect the Firm. The Firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, investment managers and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Firm to credit risk and, in some cases, disputes and litigation in the event of a default by the counterparty or client. The failure of a significant market participant, or concerns about a default by such an institution, could also ##TABLE_START 10   ##TABLE_ENDlead to significant liquidity problems for, or losses or defaults by, other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect the Firm. In addition, in recent years the perceived interrelationship among financial institutions has also led to claims by other market participants and regulators that the Firm and other financial institutions have allegedly violated anti-trust or anti-competition laws by colluding to manipulate markets, prices or indices, and there is no assurance that such allegations will not arise in the same or similar contexts in the future. As part of providing clearing services, the Firm is a member of a number of central counterparties (CCPs), and may be required to pay a portion of the losses incurred by such organizations as a result of the default of other members. As a clearing member, the Firm is also exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate through the maintenance of adequate collateral. In addition, the Firm can be exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to such clients. If a client for which the Firm provides such services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the Firm may suffer losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with various parties, including one or more CCPs, or the clients bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or involved in regulatory investigations. All of such events can increase the Firms operational and litigation costs and may result in losses if any collateral received by the Firm is insufficient to cover such losses. During periods of market stress or illiquidity, the Firms credit risk also may be further increased when the Firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to the Firm. Further, disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and the Firm could suffer losses during such periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral. Concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses. JPMorgan Chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers or counterparties are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of the Firms borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the credit quality of other borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries and thereby could exacerbate the Firms credit risk exposure and potentially increase its losses, including mark-to-market losses in its trading businesses. Similarly, challenging economic conditions affecting a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of the Firms borrowers or counterparties, not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located, or about the ability of customers of the Firms consumer businesses living in such areas or working in such affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to the Firm. As a result, the Firm regularly monitors various segments of its exposures to assess potential concentration or contagion risks. The Firms efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against concentration risks may not be successful. In addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the Firms inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce the Firms positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but may also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on the Firms balance sheet, thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs, all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the Firms businesses. Liquidity Risk If JPMorgan Chase does not effectively manage its liquidity, its business could suffer. JPMorgan Chases liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses. Some potential conditions that could impair the Firms liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise experiencing disruption, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including, among others, commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities (SPEs) or other entities), difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets, default by a CCP or other counterparty, unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, and lack of market or customer confidence in the Firm or financial markets in general. These conditions may be caused by events over which the Firm has little or no control. The widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the Firms cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity (such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, credit card receivables and other assets) during that time, and there is no assurance that these severe conditions could not occur in the future. If the Firms access to stable and low cost sources of funding, such as bank deposits, is reduced, the Firm may need to raise alternative funding which may be more expensive or of limited availability. In addition, the Firms cost of funding could be affected by actions that the Firm may take in order to satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements, to lower its GSIB systemic risk score or to satisfy the amount of eligible LTD that the Firm must have outstanding under the final TLAC rules. As a holding company, JPMorgan Chase  Co. relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and, consequently, its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations. These payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, loans or other payments. Several of JPMorgan Chase  Co.s principal subsidiaries are ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I subject to dividend distribution, capital adequacy or liquidity coverage requirements or other regulatory restrictions on their ability to provide such payments. Limitations in the payments that JPMorgan Chase  Co. receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations. Proposed banking regulations relating to liquidity, including U.S. rules relating to total loss-absorbing capacity, could require JPMorgan Chase to issue a substantial amount of new debt, and thereby significantly increase its funding costs. On October 30, 2015, the Federal Reserve issued proposed rules (the proposed TLAC rules) that would require the top-tier holding companies of eight U.S. global systemically important bank holding companies (U.S. GSIB BHCs), including JPMorgan Chase  Co., among other things, to maintain minimum amounts of eligible LTD, commencing January 1, 2019. The proposed TLAC rules would disqualify from eligible LTD, among other instruments, senior debt securities that permit acceleration for reasons other than insolvency or payment default, as well as debt securities that are not governed by U.S. law and structured notes. The currently outstanding senior long-term debt of U.S. GSIB BHCs, including JPMorgan Chase  Co., includes structured notes as well as other debt that typically permits acceleration for reasons other than insolvency or payment default and, as a result, none of such outstanding senior long-term debt or any subsequently issued senior long-term debt with similar terms would qualify as eligible LTD under the proposed TLAC rules. The Federal Reserve has requested comment on whether certain currently outstanding instruments should be allowed to count as eligible LTD despite containing features that would be prohibited under the proposal. The steps that the U.S. GSIB BHCs, including JPMorgan Chase  Co., may need to take to  come into compliance with the final TLAC rules, including the amount and form of long-term debt that must be refinanced or issued, will depend in substantial part on the ultimate eligibility requirements for senior long-term debt and any grandfathering provisions. To the extent that outstanding senior long-term debt of JPMorgan Chase  Co. is not classified as eligible LTD under the TLAC rule as finally adopted by the Federal Reserve, the Firm could be required to issue a substantial amount of new senior long-term debt which could significantly increase the Firms funding costs. Authorities in some non-U.S. jurisdictions in which the Firm has operations have enacted legislation or regulations requiring that certain subsidiaries of the Firm operating in those countries maintain independent capital and liquidity. In addition, some non-U.S. regulators have proposed that large banks which conduct certain businesses in their jurisdictions operate through separate subsidiaries located in those countries. These requirements, and any future laws or regulations that seek to increase capital or liquidity requirements that would be applicable to non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Firm, could hinder the Firms ability to efficiently manage its funding and liquidity in a centralized manner. Reductions in JPMorgan Chases credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding, as well as the value of debt obligations issued by the Firm. JPMorgan Chase  Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are currently rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate both general and firm- and industry-specific factors when determining their credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, legal expenses, assumptions surrounding government support, and ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries. Although the Firm closely monitors and manages, to the extent it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings, there is no assurance that the Firms credit ratings will not be lowered in the future, or that any such downgrade would not occur at times of broader market instability when the Firms options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low. Furthermore, a reduction in the Firms credit ratings could reduce the Firms access to capital markets, materially increase the cost of issuing securities, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted, contractually or otherwise, to do business with or lend to the Firm, thereby curtailing the Firms business operations and reducing its profitability. In addition, any such reduction in credit ratings may increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase  Co. and its subsidiaries and, as a result, could adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations that JPMorgan Chase  Co. and its subsidiaries have issued or may issue in the future. Legal Risk JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the Firm. JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against the Firm may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Firm, which could materially and adversely affect the Firms business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious harm to the Firms reputation. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that the Firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations. In addition, and as noted above, the Firms businesses and operations are also subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Regulators and other government agencies examine the operations of the Firm and its subsidiaries on both a routine- and targeted-exam basis, and there is no assurance that they will not pursue additional regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against the Firm in the future. ##TABLE_START 12   ##TABLE_ENDA single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions. These and other initiatives from U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities and officials may subject the Firm to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause the Firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm the Firms reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing the Firms profitability, or result in collateral consequences as discussed above. Other Business Risks JPMorgan Chases operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary and political developments in the U.S. and around the world. JPMorgan Chases businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities and agencies. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the U.S. and the return earned on those loans and investments. Changes in Federal Reserve policies (as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of non-U.S. central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies, such as pegging the exchange rate of their currency to the currencies of others) are beyond the Firms control and may be difficult to predict, and consequently, unanticipated changes in these policies could have a negative impact on the Firms activities and results of operations. The Firms businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and market-making in securities, loans and other obligations of companies worldwide. These risks include, among others, negative effects from slowing growth rates or recessionary economic conditions, or the risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, in the countries or regions in which such companies operate, as well as the other risks and considerations as described further below. Several of the Firms businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities. These activities can expose the Firm to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputation risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, which could adversely affect the Firms financial condition and results of operations. Further, various countries or regions in which the Firm operates or invests, or in which the Firm may do so in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. Low or volatile oil prices, coupled with the slowdown in the macroeconomic prospects in China, and concerns about economic weaknesses in the Eurozone (including the permanent resolution of the Greek bailout program), could continue to undermine investor confidence and affect the operating environment in 2016. In some cases, concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries can cause a contraction of available credit and reduced activity among trading partners or create market volatility that could lead to market contagion affecting other countries in the same region or beyond the region. Accordingly, it is possible that economic disruptions in certain countries, even in countries in which the Firm does not conduct business or have operations or engages in only limited activities, may adversely affect the Firm. JPMorgan Chases operations in emerging markets may be hindered by local political, social and economic factors, and may be subject to additional compliance costs and risks. Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the U.S. and other developed markets in which the Firm currently operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, low or negative growth, or defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt, among other negative conditions, or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment. In addition, these countries, as well as certain more developed countries, have recently been more susceptible to unfavorable political, social or economic developments; these development have in the past resulted in, and may in the future lead to, social unrest, general strikes and demonstrations, crime and corruption, security and personal safety issues, outbreaks of hostilities, overthrow of incumbent governments, terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord, all of which can adversely affect the Firms operations or investments in such countries. Political, social or economic disruption or dislocation in certain countries or regions in which the Firm conducts its businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations. Less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the Firms operations in those countries, including, among others, the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions; the promulgation of conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations; uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations; difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive; and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions. ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I Revenue from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations, as well as due to governmental actions including monetary policies, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, and changes in laws and regulations. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets. Also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can affect, and in the past conditions of these types have affected, the Firms operations and investments in another country or countries, including the Firms operations in the U.S. As a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the Firms business and results of operations. Conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the Firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. There can be no assurance that the Firm will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems or that the Firm will be able to develop effective working relationships with local regulators. In addition, the Firm can also incur higher costs, and face greater compliance risks, in structuring and operating its businesses outside the U.S. to comply with U.S. anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. JPMorgan Chase relies on the effectiveness and integrity of its processes, operating systems and employees, and those of third parties, and certain failures of such processes or systems or misconduct by such employees could materially and adversely affect the Firms operations. JPMorgan Chases businesses are dependent on the Firms ability to process, record and monitor an increasingly large number of complex transactions and to do so on a faster and more frequent basis. The Firms front- and back-office trading systems similarly rely on their access to, and on the functionality of, the operating systems maintained by third parties such as clearing and payment systems, central counterparties, securities exchanges and data processing and technology companies. If the Firms financial, accounting, trading or other data processing systems, or the operating systems of third parties on which the Firms businesses are dependent, are unable to meet these increasingly demanding standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Firm could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, as the speed, frequency, volume and complexity of transactions (and the requirements to report such transactions on a real-time basis to clients, regulators and financial intermediaries) increases, the risk of human and/or systems error in connection with such transactions increases, and it becomes more challenging to maintain the Firms operational systems and infrastructure. The Firm is similarly dependent on its employees. The Firm could be materially and adversely affected if one or more of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the Firms operations or systems. In addition, when the Firm changes processes or introduces new products and services or new connectivity solutions, the Firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Any of these occurrences could diminish the Firms ability to operate one or more of its businesses, or result in potential liability to clients and customers, increased operating expenses, higher litigation costs (including fines and sanctions), damage to reputation, impairment of liquidity, regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Firm. Third parties with which the Firm does business, including retailers and other third parties with which the Firms customers do business, can also be sources of operational risk to the Firm, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the Firms security and control systems, such as through the use of the internet, personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services. As the Firms interconnectivity with these third parties increases, the Firm increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to their systems. Security breaches affecting the Firms customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties, may require the Firm to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Firm or its customers, thereby increasing the Firms operational costs and potentially diminishing customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, and the increased importance of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially impact the Firms ability to conduct business. The Firms businesses are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals (including clients, clients clients, employees of the Firm and its suppliers and other third parties). Ensuring that the Firms collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can increase the Firms operating costs, impact the development of new products or services and require significant oversight by management, and may require the Firm to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. Furthermore, the Firm may not be able to ensure that all of its clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and the Firm, particularly where such information is transmitted by ##TABLE_START 14   ##TABLE_ENDelectronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients or others were to be mishandled or misused (in situations where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties), the Firm could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of the Firms measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause the Firm to lose customers or potential customers for its products and services and thereby reduce the Firms revenues. Accordingly, any failure or perceived failure by the Firm to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage the Firms reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses. The Firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the Firms control, which may include, for example, security breaches (as discussed further below); electrical or telecommunications outages; failures of computer servers or other damage to the Firms property or assets; natural disasters or severe weather conditions; health emergencies or pandemics; or events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. JPMorgan Chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure that the Firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. While the Firm believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate, there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the Firm or its customers and clients. Any failures or disruptions of the Firms systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients, adversely affect the Firms business and results of operations by subjecting the Firm to losses or liability, or require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption, as well as by exposing the Firm to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance. A breach in the security of JPMorgan Chases systems, or those of other market participants, could disrupt the Firms businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the Firm. Although JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Firms computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Firm and its customers and clients, there is no assurance that all of the Firms security measures will provide absolute security. JPMorgan Chase and other companies have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, including through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. The Firm is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious code and viruses, and has experienced several significant distributed denial-of-service attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties which were intended to disrupt online banking services. Despite the Firms efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, it is possible that the Firm may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to its systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types inside or outside the Firm, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Firm such as persons who are associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of the Firms systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Firms data or that of its customers or clients. These risks may increase in the future as the Firm continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the Firms systems or the systems of another market participant could cause serious negative consequences for the Firm, including significant disruption of the Firms operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Firm or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Firm and those of its customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Firm or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Firms security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to the Firms reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Firm. Risk Management JPMorgan Chases framework for managing risks and its risk management procedures and practices may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to the Firm, thereby resulting in losses. JPMorgan Chases risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the Firm. The Firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which the Firm is subject. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the Firms risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I in the future, risks that the Firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified. In addition, the Firm relies on data to aggregate and assess its various risk exposures, and any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of the Firms data aggregation and validation procedures could result in ineffective risk management practices or inaccurate risk reporting. Any lapse in the Firms risk management framework and governance structure or other inadequacies in the design or implementation of the Firms risk management framework, governance, procedures, practices, models or risk reporting systems could, individually or in the aggregate, cause unexpected losses for the Firm, materially and adversely affect the Firms financial condition and results of operations, require significant resources to remediate any risk management deficiency, attract heightened regulatory scrutiny, expose the Firm to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings, subject the Firm to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firms reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence. The Firms products, including loans, leases, lending commitments, derivatives and trading account assets, as well as the investment securities portfolio and cash management and clearing activities, expose the Firm to credit risk. The Firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties, and the credit quality of the Firms exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings. The Firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses inherent in its credit exposure, including unfunded lending-related commitments. The Firm also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the Firm in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to the Firms financial results and condition, and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the Firms borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the possibility that the Firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the Firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies. JPMorgan Chases market-making businesses may expose the Firm to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause the Firm to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument such as a derivative. Certain of the Firms trading transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that the Firm does not own; if the Firm is unable to obtain such securities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery, this could cause the Firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays, which could damage the Firms reputation and ability to transact future business. In addition, in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis, the Firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, the Firm may be exposed to market and operational losses. In particular, In addition, disputes with counterparties may arise regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts, including with respect to the value of underlying collateral, which could cause the Firm to incur unexpected costs, including transaction, operational, legal and litigation costs, or result in credit losses, all of which may impair the Firms ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products. In a difficult or less liquid market environment, the Firms risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for the Firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants or widespread market dislocations. Many of the Firms risk management strategies or techniques have a basis in historical market behavior, and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on managements subjective judgment. For example, many models used by the Firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements. These sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited and could again limit the effectiveness of the Firms risk management strategies, causing the Firm to incur losses. Many of the models used by the Firm are subject to review not only by the Firms Model Risk function but also by the Firms regulators in order that the Firm may utilize such models in connection with the Firms calculations of market risk risk-weighted assets (RWA), credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under the Advanced Approach of Basel III. The Firm may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit its ability to expand its businesses, if such models do not receive approval by its regulators. In addition, the Firm must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with vendors and other third parties that provide services to the Firm. These requirements apply to the Firm both under general guidance issued by its banking regulators and, more specifically, under certain of the consent orders to which the Firm has been subject. The Firm has incurred and expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships. Failure by the Firm to appropriately assess and manage third party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could ##TABLE_START 16   ##TABLE_ENDresult in potential liability to clients and customers, fines, penalties or judgments imposed by the Firms regulators, increased operating expenses and harm to the Firms reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Firm. Other Risks The financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chases inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations. JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment, and the Firm expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors of the Firm include other banks and financial institutions, trading, advisory and investment management firms, finance companies and technology companies and other firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading and payment processing. New technologies have required and could require the Firm to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. Ongoing or increased competition, on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation, price or other factors, may put downward pressure on prices for the Firms products and services or may cause the Firm to lose market share. In addition, the failure of any of the Firms businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions or underperformance (relative to competitors or to benchmarks), could impact the Firms ability to retain clients and customers or attract new clients and customers, thereby reducing the Firms revenues. Increased competition also may require the Firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive. The Firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations. Competitors of the Firms non-U.S. wholesale businesses are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. The more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to U.S. financial services institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase, can put the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to its non-U.S. competitors, including prohibiting the Firm from engaging in certain transactions, imposing higher capital and liquidity requirements on the Firm, making the Firms pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the Firms cost structure for providing certain products, all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the Firms wholesale businesses. JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success. JPMorgan Chases employees are the Firms most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The Firm endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees. The Firm also seeks to retain a pipeline of senior employees with superior talent, augmented from time to time by external hires, to provide continuity of succession for the Firms Operating Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer position, and senior positions below the Operating Committee. The Firm regularly reviews candidates for senior management positions to assess whether they currently are ready for a next-level role. In addition, the Firms Board of Directors is deeply involved in succession planning, including review of the succession plans for the Chief Executive Officer and the members of the Operating Committee. If for any reason the Firm were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer or members of the Operating Committee, the Firms performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected. JPMorgan Chases financial statements are based in part on estimates and judgments which, if incorrect, could result in unexpected losses in the future. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP), JPMorgan Chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation, among other items. Certain of the Firms financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, instruments in the investment securities portfolio, certain loans, MSRs, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Firms financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If estimates or judgments underlying the Firms financial statements are incorrect, the Firm may experience material losses. Lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the Firms operations, profitability or reputation. There can be no assurance that the Firms disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I and adversely affect the Firms business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose the Firm to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject it to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firms reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence. Damage to JPMorgan Chases reputation could damage its businesses. Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to the Firms ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. Damage to the Firms reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the Firms business and prospects. Harm to the Firms reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, security breaches, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. The Firms reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of an affiliate, joint-venturer or merchant banking portfolio company, or a vendor or other third party with which the Firm does business, to comply with laws or regulations. In addition, a failure or perceived failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, to treat customers and clients fairly, to provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the appropriate standards, or to handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to the Firms reputation. Adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding the Firm, whether or not true, may result in harm to the Firms prospects. Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the Firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among the Firms clients. The failure or perceived failure to adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest has given rise to litigation and enforcement actions and may do so in the future and could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the Firm, as well as cause serious harm to the Firms reputation. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the Firms reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms during the financial crisis, including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions, has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole. Should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the Firms reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the Firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the damage to its reputation could not adversely affect the Firms earnings and results of operations, or that damage to the Firms reputation will not impair the Firms ability to retain its existing or attract new customers, investors and employees.

See Managements report on internal control over financial reporting on page 174 . As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firms management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).

See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

The Firms businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firms products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. With respect to some of its geographies and products, JPMorgan Chase competes globally; with respect to others, the Firm competes on a national or regional basis. The Firms ability to compete also depends on its ability to attract and retain professional and other personnel, and on its reputation. It is likely that competition in the financial services industry will become even more intense as the Firms businesses continue to compete with other financial institutions that may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies or that operate under different rules and regulatory regimes than the Firm, or with companies that provide new or innovative products or services that the Firm does not provide. Supervision and regulation The Firm is subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as well as the applicable laws of each of the various jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business.  As a result of regulatory reforms enacted and proposed in the U.S. and abroad, the Firm has been experiencing a period of significant change in regulation which has had and could continue to have significant consequences for how the Firm conducts business. The Firm continues to work diligently in assessing the regulatory changes it is facing, and is devoting substantial resources to comply with all the new regulations, while, at the same time, endeavoring to best meet the needs and expectations of its customers, clients and shareholders. These efforts include the implementation of new policies, procedures and controls, and appropriate adjustments to the Firms business and operations, legal entity structure, and capital and liquidity management. The combined effect of numerous rule-makings by multiple governmental agencies and regulators, and the potential conflicts or inconsistencies among such ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I rules, present challenges and risks to the Firms business and operations. Given the current status of the regulatory developments, the Firm cannot currently quantify all of the possible effects on its business and operations of the significant changes that are underway. For more information, see Risk Factors on pages 821 . Financial holding company: Consolidated supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) . As a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company, JPMorgan Chase is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve acts as an umbrella regulator and certain of JPMorgan Chases subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional authorities based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries. For example, JPMorgan Chases national bank subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Chase Bank USA, N.A., are subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and, with respect to certain matters, by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC). Certain non-bank subsidiaries, such as the Firms U.S. broker-dealers, are subject to supervision and regulation by the SEC, and subsidiaries of the Firm that engage in certain futures-related and swaps-related activities  are subject to supervision and regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). J.P. Morgan Securities plc, is a U.K. bank licensed within the European Economic Area (the EEA) to undertake all banking activity and is regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (the PRA), a subsidiary of the Bank of England which has responsibility for prudential regulation of banks and other systemically important institutions, and by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates prudential matters for firms that are not so regulated by the PRA and conduct matters for all market participants. The Firms other non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the banking and securities regulatory authorities in the countries in which they operate. See Securities and broker-dealer regulation, Investment management regulation and Derivatives regulation below. In addition, the Firms consumer activities are subject to supervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)  and to regulation under various state statutes which are enforced by the respective states Attorney General.  Scope of permissible business activities. The Bank Holding Company Act generally restricts BHCs from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities. Financial holding companies generally can engage in a broader range of financial activities than are otherwise permissible for BHCs,  including underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities, and making merchant banking investments in non-financial companies.  The Federal Reserve has the authority to limit a financial holding companys ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities if the financial holding company or any of its depositary institution subsidiaries ceases to meet the applicable eligibility requirements (including requirements that the financial holding company and each of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries maintain their status as well-capitalized and well-managed).  The Federal Reserve may also impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may, for example, require divestiture of the holding companys depository institutions if the deficiencies persist. Federal regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies. In addition, a financial holding company must obtain Federal Reserve approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both in the U.S. and internationally, as further described under Regulation of acquisitions below.  Activities restrictions under the Volcker Rule. Section 619 of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) (the Volcker Rule) prohibits banking entities, including the Firm , from engaging in certain proprietary trading activities, subject to exceptions for underwriting, market-making, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. In addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, covered funds (as defined by the Volcker Rule) and imposes limits on certain transactions between the Firm and its sponsored funds (see JPMorgan Chases subsidiary banks  Restrictions on transactions with affiliates below). The Volcker Rule requires banking entities to establish comprehensive compliance programs reasonably designed to help ensure and monitor compliance with the restrictions under the Volcker Rule, including, in order to distinguish permissible from impermissible risk-taking activities, the measurement, monitoring and reporting of certain key metrics. Capital and liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve establishes capital and leverage requirements for the Firm and evaluates its compliance with such requirements. The OCC establishes similar capital and leverage requirements for the Firms national banking subsidiaries. For more information about the applicable requirements relating to risk-based capital and leverage in the U.S. under the most recent capital framework established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee)(Basel III) , see Capital Risk Management on pages 7685  and Note 28 . Under Basel III, bank holding companies and banks are required to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests: the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). The U.S. banking regulators have approved the final LCR rule (U.S. LCR), which became effective on January 1, 2015. In April 2016, the U.S. banking regulators issued a proposed rule for NSFR. For additional information on these ratios, see Liquidity Risk Management on pages 110115 . On December 19, 2016 the Federal Reserve published final ##TABLE_START 2   ##TABLE_ENDU.S. LCR public disclosure requirements. Starting with the second quarter of 2017, the Firm will be required to disclose quarterly its consolidated LCR pursuant to the U.S. LCR rule, including the Firms average LCR for the quarter and the key quantitative components of the average LCR in a standardized template, along with a qualitative discussion of material drivers of the ratio, changes over time, and causes of such changes. On September 8, 2016 the Federal Reserve published the framework that will apply to the setting of the countercyclical capital buffer. As of October 24, 2016 the Federal Reserve reaffirmed setting the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer at 0%, and stated that it will review the amount at least annually.  Banking supervisors continue to consider refinements and enhancements to the Basel III capital framework for financial institutions. The Basel Committee finalized revisions to market risk capital for trading books and the treatment of interest rate risk in the banking book; other proposals being contemplated by the Basel Committee include revisions to, among others,  standardized credit and operational risk capital frameworks , a recalibration of the leverage ratio, revisions to the securitization framework, and changes to the definition of defaulted assets. In January 2017, the Basel Committee announced that the review of the proposals to finalize the post-crisis regulatory reforms has been postponed. After a proposal is finalized by the Basel Committee, U.S. banking regulators would then need to propose requirements applicable to U.S. financial institutions.  In March 2016, the Federal Reserve Board released a revised proposal to establish single-counterparty credit limits for large U.S. bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations.  Stress tests. The Federal Reserve has adopted supervisory stress tests for large bank holding companies, including JPMorgan Chase, which form part of the Federal Reserves annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) framework. Under the framework, the Firm must conduct semi-annual company-run stress tests and, in addition, must submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by the Firm and the Federal Reserve. In reviewing the Firms capital plan, the Federal Reserve considers both quantitative and qualitative factors. Qualitative assessments include, among other things, the comprehensiveness of the plan, the assumptions and analysis underlying the plan, and the extent to which the Firm has satisfied certain supervisory matters related to the Firms processes and analyses, including the design and operational effectiveness of the controls governing such processes. Moreover, the Firm is required to receive a notice of non-objection from the Federal Reserve before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to perform separate, similar annual stress tests. The Firm publishes each year the results of its mid-cycle stress tests under the Firms internally-developed severely adverse scenario and the results of its (and its two primary subsidiary banks) annual stress tests under the supervisory severely adverse scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The Firm will file its 2017 annual CCAR submission on April 5. Results will be published by the Federal Reserve by June 30, with disclosures of results by BHCs, including the Firm, to follow within 15 days. The mid-cycle capital stress test submissions are due on October 5 and BHCs, including the Firm , will publish results by November 4.  For additional information on the Firms CCAR, see Capital Risk Management on pages 7685 . Enhanced prudential standards. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), among other things, recommends prudential standards and reporting and disclosure requirements to the Federal Reserve for systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), such as JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve has adopted several rules to implement the heightened prudential standards, including final rules relating to risk management and corporate governance of subject BHCs. BHCs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets are required to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, and their boards of directors are required to conduct appropriate oversight of their risk management activities. For information on liquidity measures, see Liquidity Risk Management on pages 110115 . Several additional proposed rules are still being considered, including an early remediation framework to address financial distress or material management weaknesses.  Orderly liquidation authority and resolution and recovery. As a BHC with assets of $50 billion or more, the Firm is required to submit annually to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for resolution under the Bankruptcy Code in the event of material distress or failure (a resolution plan). The FDIC also requires each insured depository institution with $50 billion or more in assets , such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., to provide a resolution plan. For more information about the Firms resolution plan, see Risk Factors on pages 821 as well as Business Overview on pages 3738 for information regarding the Firms 2016 Resolution Submission. In addition, certain financial companies, including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its subsidiaries, can be subjected to resolution under an orderly liquidation authority. The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States, must first make certain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk determinations, and action must be recommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent such actions, the Firm , as a BHC, would remain subject to resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. In December 2013, the FDIC issued a draft policy statement describing its single point of entry strategy for resolution of systemically important financial institutions under the orderly liquidation authority. This strategy seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of the BHC open and impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the holding company in ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I receivership according to their statutory order of priority. For further information see Risk Factors on pages 821 . The Firm has a comprehensive recovery plan detailing the actions it would take to avoid failure by remaining well-capitalized and well-funded in the case of an adverse event. JPMorgan Chase has provided the Federal Reserve with comprehensive confidential supervisory information and analyses about the Firms businesses, legal entities and corporate governance and about its crisis management governance, capabilities and available alternatives to raise liquidity and capital in severe market circumstances. The OCC has published guidelines establishing standards for recovery planning by insured national banks, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. have submitted their recovery plans to the OCC. For further information see Risk Factors on pages 821 . In addition, certain of the Firms non-U.S. subsidiaries are subject to resolution and recovery planning requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate.  Regulators in the U.S. and abroad continue to be focused on developing measures designed to address the possibility or perception that large financial institutions, including the Firm, may be too big to fail, and to provide safeguards so that, if a large financial institution does fail, it can be resolved without the use of public funds. Higher capital surcharges on global systemically important banks (GSIBs), requirements for certain large bank holding companies to maintain a minimum amount of long-term debt to facilitate orderly resolution of those firms, and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) protocol relating to the close-out of derivatives transactions during the resolution of a large cross-border financial institution, are examples of initiatives to address too big to fail.  For further information on the GSIB framework and Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC), see Capital Risk Management on pages 7685 and Risk Factors on pages 821 , and on the ISDA close-out protocol, see Derivatives regulation below.  Holding company as source of strength for bank subsidiaries . JPMorgan Chase  Co. is required to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the Federal Reserve at times when the Firm might otherwise determine not to provide it.  Regulation of acquisitions. Acquisitions by bank holding companies and their banks are subject to multiple requirements by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. For example, financial holding companies and bank holding companies are required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before they may acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of an unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by financial companies are prohibited if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies. In addition, for certain acquisitions, the Firm must provide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company with over $10 billion in assets that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature. JPMorgan Chases subsidiary banks:  The Firms two primary subsidiary banks, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., are FDIC-insured national banks regulated by the OCC. As national banks, the activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. are limited to those specifically authorized under the National Bank Act and related interpretations by the OCC. FDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance fund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits and is funded through assessments on banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. Changes in the methodology used to calculate such assessments, resulting from the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, significantly increased the assessments that the Firms bank subsidiaries pay annually to the FDIC. The FDIC instituted a new assessment surcharge on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion in order to raise the reserve ratio for the FDIC deposit insurance fund. Future FDIC rule-making could further increase such assessments.  FDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC could be appointed as the conservator or receiver under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA).  The FDIC has broad powers to transfer any assets and liabilities without the approval of the institutions creditors. For further information on the impact to creditors, see Risk Factors on pages 821 . Cross-guarantee. An FDIC-insured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the FDIC if another FDIC-insured institution that is under common control with such institution is in default or is deemed to be in danger of default (commonly referred to as cross-guarantee liability). An FDIC cross-guarantee claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution.  Prompt corrective action and early remediation. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. While these regulations apply only to banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against the parent BHC, such as JPMorgan Chase  Co., based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In certain instances, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary.  ##TABLE_START 4   ##TABLE_ENDOCC Heightened Standards. The OCC has established guidelines setting forth heightened standards for large banks. The guidelines establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks. While the bank can use certain components of the parent companys risk governance framework, the framework must ensure that the banks risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from the parent for risk management purposes. The banks board or risk committee is responsible for approving the banks risk governance framework, providing active oversight of the banks risk-taking activities, and holding management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework. Restrictions on transactions with affiliates. The bank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase (including subsidiaries of those banks) are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, investments in stock or securities of, and derivatives, securities lending and certain other transactions with, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and certain other affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan Chase  Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from such subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts and comply with certain other requirements. For more information, see Note 27. In addition, the Volcker Rule imposes a prohibition on such transactions between any JPMorgan Chase entity and covered funds for which a JPMorgan Chase entity serves as the investment manager, investment advisor, commodity trading advisor or sponsor, as well as, subject to a limited exception, any covered fund controlled by such funds.  Dividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. See Note 27 for the amount of dividends that the Firms principal bank subsidiaries could pay, at January 1, 2017, to their respective bank holding companies without the approval of their banking regulators.  In addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the OCC and the Federal Reserve have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends of the bank subsidiaries they supervise , if, in the banking regulators opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank. Depositor preference. Under federal law, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and foreign deposits that are payable in the U.S. as well as in a foreign branch) have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including public noteholders and depositors in non-U.S. offices. As a result, such persons could receive substantially less than the depositors in U.S. offices of the depository institution. CFPB regulation and supervision, and other consumer regulations. JPMorgan Chase and its national bank subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., are subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. These laws include the Truth-in-Lending, Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), Fair Credit Reporting, Fair Debt Collection Practice, Electronic Funds Transfer, Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) and Home Mortgage Disclosure Acts. The CFPB has authority to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service. The CFPBs rule-making efforts have addressed mortgage-related topics, including ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requirements, appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higher-priced mortgages. The CFPB continues to issue informal guidance on a variety of topics (such as the collection of consumer debts and credit card marketing practices). Other areas of focus include sales incentives, pre-authorized electronic funds transfers, add-on products, matters involving consumer populations considered vulnerable by the CFPB (such as students), credit reporting, and the furnishing of credit scores to individuals. As part of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has taken enforcement actions against certain financial institutions, including the Firm. Securities and broker-dealer regulation:  The Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and other broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations of the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the New York Stock Exchange, among others. The Firm conducts similar securities activities outside the U.S. subject to local regulatory requirements. In the U.K., those activities are conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc and are regulated PRA and the FCA. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customers funds, the financing of clients purchases, capital structure, record-keeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers and employees. For information on the net capital of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and the applicable requirements relating to risk-based capital for J.P. Morgan Securities plc, see Broker-dealer regulatory capital on page 85 . In addition, rules adopted by the Department of Labor would impose (among other things) a new standard of care applicable to broker-dealers when dealing with customers. For more information see - Investment management regulation below.  ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I Investment management regulation:  The Firms asset management businesses are subject to significant investment management regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding of client assets, offerings of funds, marketing activities, transactions among affiliates and management of client funds. Certain of the Firms subsidiaries are registered with, and subject to oversight by, the SEC as investment advisers. As such, the Firms registered investment advisers are subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as various state securities laws. For information regarding investigations and litigation in connection with disclosures to clients related to proprietary products, see Note 31. The Firms asset management businesses continue to be affected by ongoing rule-making and implementation of new regulations. The SEC amendments to rules that govern money-market funds, requiring a floating net asset value for institutional prime money-market funds became effective October 14, 2016. In addition, the SEC adopted amendments regarding enhanced liquidity risk management for open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and enhanced reporting for funds and advisors. The Department of Labor (DOL) fiduciary rule would significantly expand the universe of persons viewed as investment advice fiduciaries to retirement plans and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA).  Among the most significant impacts of the rule and related prohibited transaction exemptions would be the impact on the fee and compensation practices at financial institutions that offer investment advice to retail retirement clients. The related exemptions would require new client contracts, adherence to impartial conduct standards (including a requirement to act in the best interest of retirement clients), implementation of policies and procedures, websites and other disclosures to both investors and the DOL. The rule was due to become applicable from April 10, 2017; however following a recent memorandum from the White House directing review of the rule, the DOL announced that it is considering legal options for delaying the rules applicability.  Derivatives regulation: The Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its derivatives businesses. The regulations impose capital and margin requirements (including the collecting and posting of variation margin and initial margin in respect of non-centrally cleared derivatives), require central clearing of standardized over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, require that certain standardized over-the-counter swaps be traded on regulated trading venues, and provide for reporting of certain mandated information. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the registration of swap dealers and major swap participants with the CFTC and of security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants with the SEC. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities plc and J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corporation have registered with the CFTC as swap dealers, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc may be required to register with the SEC as security-based swap dealers. As a result of their registration as swap dealers or security-based swap dealers, these entities will be subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to their swap or security-based swap activities, which includes capital requirements, rules regulating their swap activities, rules requiring the collateralization of uncleared swaps, rules regarding segregation of counterparty collateral, business conduct and documentation standards, record-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-fraud and anti-manipulation requirements. Further, some of the rules for derivatives apply extraterritorially to U.S. firms doing business with clients outside of the U.S., as well as to the overseas activities of non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Firm that either deal with U.S. persons or that are guaranteed by U.S. subsidiaries of the Firm ; however, the full scope of the extra-territorial impact of the U.S. swaps regulation has not been finalized and therefore remains unclear. The effect of these rules may require banking entities, such as the Firm , to modify the structure of their derivatives businesses and face increased operational and regulatory costs. In the European Union (the EU), the implementation of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and the revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) will result in comparable, but not identical, changes to the European regulatory regime for derivatives. The combined effect of the U.S. and EU requirements, and the potential conflicts and inconsistencies between them, present challenges and risks to the structure and operating model of the Firms derivatives businesses.  The Firm and other financial institutions have agreed to adhere to an updated Resolution Stay Protocol developed by ISDA in response to regulator concerns that the close-out of derivatives and other financial transactions during the resolution of a large cross-border financial institution could impede resolution efforts and potentially destabilize markets. The Resolution Stay Protocol provides for the contractual recognition of cross-border stays under various statutory resolution regimes and a contractual stay on certain cross-default rights.  In the U.S., one subsidiary of the Firm is registered as a futures commission merchant, and other subsidiaries are either registered with the CFTC as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors or are exempt from such registration. These CFTC-registered subsidiaries are also members of the National Futures Association.  Data regulation:  The Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations concerning the use and protection of certain customer, employee and other personal and confidential information, including those imposed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Fair Credit ##TABLE_START 6   ##TABLE_ENDReporting Act, as well as the EU Data Protection Directive. In addition, various U.S. regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the SEC, have increased their focus on cybersecurity through guidance, examinations and regulations. In May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will replace the EU Data Protection Directive, and it will have a significant impact on how businesses can collect and process the personal data of EU individuals. In addition, numerous proposals regarding privacy and data protection are pending before U.S. and non-U.S. legislative and regulatory bodies. The Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions:  The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires all financial institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers, to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA includes a variety of record-keeping and reporting requirements (such as cash transaction and suspicious activity reporting), as well as due diligence/know your customer documentation requirements. In January 2013, the Firm entered into Consent Orders with its banking regulators relating to the Firms Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering policies, procedures and controls; the Firm has taken significant steps to modify and enhance its processes and controls with respect to its Anti-Money Laundering procedures and to remediate the issues identified in the Consent Order. The Firm is also subject to the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).  Anti-Corruption:  The Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. For more information on the Firms consent judgment and non-prosecution agreement relating to referral hiring practices, see Note 31. Compensation practices:  The Firms compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as other agencies. The Federal Reserve has issued guidance jointly with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed to ensure that incentive compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the organizations safety and soundness. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve, must issue regulations or guidelines requiring covered financial institutions, including the Firm , to report the structure of all incentive-based compensation arrangements and prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing compensation that is excessive or that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. Proposed regulations were issued in 2016, and the public comment period has closed. Final regulations have not yet been published. The Federal Reserve has conducted a review of the incentive compensation policies and practices of a number of large banking institutions, including the Firm. In addition to the Federal Reserve, the Financial Stability Board has established standards covering compensation principles for banks. In Europe, the Fourth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) includes compensation provisions and the European Banking Authority has instituted guidelines on compensation policies under CRD IV. In the U.K., compensation standards are governed by the Remuneration Code of the PRA and the FCA. The implementation of the Federal Reserves and other banking regulators guidelines regarding compensation are expected to evolve over the next several years, and may affect the manner in which the Firm structures its compensation programs and practices.  Significant international regulatory initiatives:  In the EU, there is an extensive and complex program of final and proposed regulatory enhancement that reflects, in part, the EUs commitments to policies of the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (G-20) together with other plans specific to the EU. The EU operates a European Systemic Risk Board that monitors financial stability, together with European Supervisory Agencies that set detailed regulatory rules and encourage supervisory convergence across the 28 Member States. The EU has also created a Single Supervisory Mechanism for the euro-zone, under which the regulation of all banks in that zone will be under the auspices of the European Central Bank, together with a Single Resolution Mechanism and Single Resolution Board, having jurisdiction over bank resolution in the zone. At both the G-20 and EU levels, various proposals are under consideration to address risks associated with global financial institutions. Some of the initiatives adopted include increased capital requirements for certain trading instruments or exposures and compensation limits on certain employees located in affected countries.  Guided by the G20 policy framework, the EU and national financial regulators have proposed or adopted several market reforms, including EMIR, which requires, among other things, the central clearing of standardized derivatives; and MiFID II, which gives effect to the G-20 commitment to trading of derivatives through central clearing houses and exchanges and also includes significantly enhanced requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency and a significant reconfiguration of the regulatory supervision of execution venues. Key aspects of EMIR and MiFID II have been finalized, although the implementation date of MiFID II has been delayed to 2018. The EU is also currently considering or implementing significant revisions to laws covering depositary activities; credit-rating activities; resolution of banks, investment firms and market infrastructures; anti-money laundering controls; data security and privacy; corporate governance in financial firms; and implementation in the EU of the Basel III capital and liquidity standards, including the introduction of ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I an intermediate holding company requirement for foreign banks and the implementation of the standard for TLAC.  The EU is also considering proposed legislation providing for a proprietary trading ban and mandatory separation of other trading activities within certain banks; various EU Member States have separately enacted similar measures. In the U.K., legislation was adopted that mandates the separation (or ring-fencing) of deposit-taking activities from securities trading and other analogous activities within banks, subject to certain exemptions. The legislation includes the supplemental recommendation of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards (the Tyrie Commission) that such ring-fences should be electrified by the imposition of mandatory forced separation on banking institutions that are deemed to test the limits of the safeguards. Parallel but distinct provisions have been enacted by the French and German governments. These measures may separately or taken together have significant implications for the Firms organizational structure in Europe, as well as its permitted activities and capital deployment in the EU.  Much of the G20 policy framework has been finalized; however, the Basel Committee is currently reviewing the framework, and proposing recalibrations of certain requirements. As such, the EU is considering or implementing significant revisions to laws covering: bank and investment firm recovery and resolution; bank structure; securities settlement; transparency and disclosure of securities financing transactions; benchmarks; resolution of market infrastructures (central counterparties (CCPs)); anti-money laundering controls; data security and privacy; and corporate governance in financial firms; together with new amendments to capital and liquidity standards.  Consistent with the G20 and EU policy frameworks, U.K. regulators have adopted a range of policy measures that have significantly changed the markets and prudential regulatory environment in the U.K. In addition to broad recommendations made by the Fair and Effective Markets Review which focused on fixed income currencies and commodities markets, U.K. regulators are considering measures to raise standards and accountability of individuals, and promote forward-looking conduct risk identification and mitigation, including by introducing the new Senior Managers and Certification Regimes. On June 23, 2016, the U.K. voted by referendum to leave the European Union (Brexit). The U.K. Government has since announced that it will invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and will start the formal exit negotiations by the end of March 2017, giving an expected exit date of the end of March 2019. More recently, the British Prime Minister  laid out twelve negotiation objectives for Brexit, which confirmed the U.K. will not remain a member of the Single Market, but will pursue a Free Trade Agreement that provides the greatest possible access to the Single Market. Further, the U.K. Government will seek a phased arrangement to ensure the orderly transition of the legal and regulatory framework for financial services, and promote stability and market confidence. Following a recent ruling by the U.K. Supreme Court, the House of Commons approved legislation on February 8, 2017 that allows the British Prime Minister to invoke Article 50. The legislation must now be approved by the House of Lords before it is signed into law.  Many international banks, including the Firm, operate substantial parts of their European Union businesses from entities based in the U.K. Upon the U.K. leaving the European Union, the regulatory and legal environment that would then exist, and to which the Firms U.K. operations would then be subject, will depend on, in certain respects, the nature of the arrangements the U.K. agreed with the European Union and other trading partners. These arrangements cannot be predicted, but currently the Firm does not believe any of the likely identified scenarios would threaten the viability of the Firms business units or the Firms ability to serve clients across the European Union and in the U.K. However, it is possible that under some scenarios, changes to the Firms legal entity structure and operations would be required, which might result in a less efficient operating model across the Firms European legal entities.  The Firm is in the process of evaluating plans to ensure its continued ability to operate in the U.K. and the EU beyond the expected exit date.  ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Regulatory Risk JPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated industry, and the Firms businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which the Firm is subject. As a global financial services firm, JPMorgan Chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the U.S. and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business. The financial services industry has in recent years experienced an unprecedented increase in regulations and supervision, both in the U.S. and globally. The cumulative effect of the new and currently proposed legislation and regulations could require the Firm to make further changes to its businesses or operations, which could result in a significant loss of revenue for the Firm and impose additional compliance and other costs on the Firm or otherwise reduce the Firms profitability. These changes could also: limit the products and services that the Firm offers; reduce the liquidity that the Firm is able to offer its clients or counterparties through its market-making activities; impede the Firms ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging; require the Firm to dispose of or curtail certain ##TABLE_START 8   ##TABLE_ENDbusinesses; affect the value of assets that the Firm holds; require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products; or otherwise adversely affect the Firms businesses. To the extent that these initiatives have been, or continue to be, imposed on a limited subset of financial institutions (based on size, activities, geography or other criteria), the requirements to which the Firm may be subject under such laws and regulations could require the Firm to restructure further its businesses, or further re-price or curtail the products or services that it offers to customers, which could result in the Firm not being able to compete effectively with other institutions that are not impacted in the same way. Authorities in some non-U.S. jurisdictions in which the Firm has operations have enacted legislation or regulations requiring that certain subsidiaries of the Firm operating in those countries maintain independent capital and liquidity. In addition, some non-U.S. regulators have proposed that large banks which conduct certain businesses in their jurisdictions operate through separate subsidiaries located in those countries. These requirements, and any future laws or regulations that seek to impose restrictions on the way the Firm organizes its business units or increase the capital or liquidity requirements on non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Firm, could hinder the Firms ability to efficiently manage its operations, increase its funding and liquidity costs and thereby decrease the Firms net income. In addition, there can be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in different countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, recent legislative and regulatory initiatives within the EU, including those relating to the resolution of financial institutions, the establishment by non-EU financial institutions of intermediate holding companies in the EU, the separation of trading activities from core banking services, mandatory on-exchange trading, position limits and reporting rules for derivatives, governance and accountability regimes, conduct of business requirements and restrictions on compensation, could require the Firm to make significant modifications to its non-U.S. business, operations and legal entity structure in order to comply with these requirements. These differences in implemented or proposed non-U.S. regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the U.S., which could subject the Firm to increased compliance and legal costs, as well as higher operational, capital and liquidity costs, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Firms business, results of operations and profitability. Recent political developments in the U.S. and abroad have increased the uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment in which the Firm will operate. Although certain of the proposals being mentioned in the U.S. include the possibility of regulatory reform related to the financial services industry, it is too early to determine the full extent to which these measures will ultimately modify or reduce the regulatory requirements currently imposed on the Firm, and the resulting possible effect on the Firm and its business and operations. In addition, the U.K.s planned departure from the EU has engendered significant uncertainty concerning the regulatory framework under which global financial services institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, will need to conduct their business and operations in the EU after the U.K.s departure. Expanded regulatory and governmental oversight of JPMorgan Chases businesses may continue to increase the Firms costs and risks. The Firms businesses and operations are subject to heightened governmental and regulatory oversight and scrutiny. The Firm has paid significant fines (or has provided significant monetary and other relief) to resolve a number of investigations or enforcement actions by governmental agencies. The Firm continues to devote substantial resources to satisfying the requirements of regulatory consent orders and other settlements to which it is subject, which increases the Firms operational and compliance costs. Certain regulators have taken measures in connection with specific enforcement actions against financial institutions (including the Firm) that require admissions of wrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection with settling such matters. Such admissions and conditions can lead to, among other things, greater exposure in civil litigation, harm to reputation, disqualification from providing business to certain clients and in certain jurisdictions, and other direct and indirect adverse effects. In addition, U.S. government officials have indicated and demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions, including the Firm, and have increasingly sought, and obtained, resolutions that include criminal pleas or other admissions of wrongdoing from those institutions, such as the Firms agreement in May 2015 to plead guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law in connection with its settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities, and the non-prosecution agreement entered into by a subsidiary of the Firm with the U.S. Department of Justice in November 2016 in connection with settlements to resolve various governmental investigations relating to a former hiring program for candidates referred by clients, potential clients and government officials in the Asia Pacific region. Such resolutions, whether with U.S. or non-U.S. authorities, could have significant collateral consequences for a subject financial institution, including loss of customers and business, or the inability to offer certain products or services, or losing permission to operate certain businesses, for a period of time (absent the forbearance of, or the granting of waivers by, applicable regulators). The Firm expects that it and the financial services industry as a whole will continue to be subject to regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions and that violations of law will more frequently be met with formal and punitive enforcement action, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than with informal supervisory action. In addition, if the Firm fails to meet the requirements of the various governmental settlements to which it is subject, or more ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I generally, to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators and other government agencies, it could be required to enter into further orders and settlements, pay additional fines, penalties or judgments, or accept material regulatory restrictions on its businesses. The extent of the Firms exposure to legal and regulatory matters may be unpredictable and could, in some cases, substantially exceed the amount of reserves that the Firm has established for such matters. Requirements for the orderly resolution of the Firm could require JPMorgan Chase to restructure or reorganize its businesses. Under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act (Title I) and Federal Reserve and FDIC rules, the Firm is required to prepare and submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a detailed plan (the Resolution Plan) for the rapid and orderly resolution, without extraordinary government support, of JPMorgan Chase  Co. and certain of its subsidiaries under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and other applicable insolvency laws in the event of future material financial distress of the Firm. In April 2016, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC jointly provided firm-specific feedback on the 2015 Resolution Plans of eight systemically important domestic banking institutions, and determined that five of these 2015 Resolution Plans, including that of the Firm, were not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In addition to the identified deficiencies, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC also identified certain shortcomings which were required to be satisfactorily addressed in the Firms Resolution Plan due on July 1, 2017. On October 1, 2016, the Firm filed with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC its submission (the 2016 Resolution Submission) describing how the Firm remediated the identified deficiencies and providing a status report of its actions to address the identified shortcomings. On December 13, 2016, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC advised the Firm of their determinations that the Firms 2016 Resolution Submission adequately remediated the deficiencies in the Firms 2015 Resolution Plan identified by the agencies. On July 1, 2017, the Firm will file with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC its 2017 Resolution Plan which will, among other things, describe how the Firm has remediated the remaining shortcomings identified by the agencies in April 2016. If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were to jointly determine that the Firm did not remediate the identified shortcomings, or that the Firms 2017 Resolution Plan, or any future update of that plan, is not credible, and the Firm is unable to remedy the identified deficiencies in a timely manner, the regulators may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on the Firm or restrictions on growth, activities or operations of the Firm, and could, if such deficiencies are not remedied within two years after such a determination, require the Firm to restructure, reorganize or divest businesses, legal entities, operational systems and/or intercompany transactions in ways that could materially and adversely affect the Firms operations and strategy. In addition, in order to continue to maintain a Title I Resolution Plan that the Federal Reserve and FDIC determine is credible, the Firm may need to make additional changes to its legal entity structure and to certain intercompany and external activities, which could result in increased funding or operational costs. Holders of JPMorgan Chases debt and equity securities will absorb losses if JPMorgan Chase were to enter into a resolution. The Federal Reserve has issued final rules (the TLAC rules) regarding the minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity that bank holding companies are required to have issued and outstanding, as well as guidelines defining the terms of qualifying debt instruments, to ensure that adequate levels of debt are maintained at the holding company level for purposes of recapitalizing the Firms operating subsidiaries (eligible LTD). If JPMorgan Chase  Co. were to enter into a resolution, either in a proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Firm will absorb the losses of JPMorgan Chase  Co. and its affiliates. Under the Firms Resolution Plan, the Firms preferred resolution strategy contemplates that only JPMorgan Chase  Co. would enter bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code pursuant to a single point of entry recapitalization strategy. JPMorgan Chase  Co.s subsidiaries would be recapitalized as needed so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, JPMorgan Chase  Co.s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of JPMorgan Chase  Co.s equity securities and thereafter on unsecured creditors, including holders of JPMorgan Chase  Co.s eligible LTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those debt securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase  Co.s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of JPMorgan Chase  Co. Accordingly, in a resolution of JPMorgan Chase  Co. under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of JPMorgan Chase  Co. would realize value only to the extent available to JPMorgan Chase  Co. as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of JPMorgan Chase  Co. have been fully repaid. If JPMorgan Chase  Co. were to enter into a resolution, none of JPMorgan Chase  Co., the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow the Firms preferred resolution strategy under its Resolution Plan. The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as JPMorgan Chase  Co., under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. Pursuant to that strategy, the FDIC would use its power to create a bridge entity for JPMorgan Chase  Co.; ##TABLE_START 10   ##TABLE_ENDtransfer the systemically important and viable parts of its business, principally the stock of JPMorgan Chase  Co.s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries, to the bridge entity; recapitalize those subsidiaries using assets of JPMorgan Chase  Co. that have been transferred to the bridge entity; and exchange external debt claims against JPMorgan Chase  Co. for equity in the bridge entity. Under this Title II resolution strategy, the value of the stock of the bridge entity that would be redistributed to holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of JPMorgan Chase  Co. may not be sufficient to repay all or part of the principal amount and interest on such securities. To date, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy and it is not obligated to follow such a strategy in a Title II resolution of JPMorgan Chase  Co. Market Risk JPMorgan Chases results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by U.S. and global financial market and economic conditions and political developments. JPMorgan Chases businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions, including the liquidity of the global financial markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates, currency and commodities prices (including oil prices) and other market indices; investor, consumer and business sentiment; events that reduce confidence in the financial markets; inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit; the economic effects of natural disasters, health emergencies or pandemics, severe weather conditions, outbreaks of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities; monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks; and the health of the U.S. and global economies. Recent political developments in the U.S. and abroad have increased the uncertainty regarding the economic environment in which the Firm will operate. Although certain of the proposals being considered in the U.S., such as tax reform or increased expenditure on infrastructure projects, could lead to higher levels of U.S. economic activity and more expansive U.S. domestic economic growth, others, such as protectionist trade policies or isolationist foreign policies, could contract economic growth. The uncertainty around the manner and extent to which these economic policies are ultimately enacted could impact market volatility and affect the Firms businesses, both directly and through their impact on the businesses and activities of the Firms clients and customers. In addition, the effects of various referenda in Europe, including the vote by the U.K. electorate to leave the EU, as well as the uncertainties regarding the outcome of Eurozone presidential elections in 2017, have triggered political and economic uncertainty in the Eurozone. There is no assurance that such uncertainty, and any resultant market volatility, will not adversely affect the Firms results of operations. In the Firms wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that the Firm executes for its clients and, therefore, the revenue that the Firm receives, as well as the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the Firm. The Firm generally maintains market-making positions in the fixed income, currency, commodities, credit and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients. The revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors, including the Firms success in effectively hedging its market and other risks; volatility in interest rates and equity, debt and commodities markets; interest rate and credit spreads; and the availability of liquidity in the capital markets, all of which are affected by global economic and market conditions, political events and regulatory restrictions on market-making activities. In addition, the Firms market-making businesses can expose the Firm to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause the Firm to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risks not having been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument. The Firm may be adversely affected by declining asset values. This is particularly true for businesses that earn fees for managing third-party assets or receive or post collateral. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of the client assets that the Firm manages or holds in custody, which, in turn, could affect the Firms revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Macroeconomic or market concerns, as well as legislative and regulatory developments (such as, for example, the recently-adopted SEC rules relating to money-market funds), may also prompt outflows from the Firms funds or accounts or cause clients to invest funds in products that generate lower revenue. Changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the Firms balance sheet and the revenue that the Firm earns from net interest income. An increasing or high interest rate environment, while generally increasing the net interest income earned by the Firm, may under certain circumstances also result in lower levels of commercial and residential loan originations and diminished returns on the investment securities portfolio (to the extent that the Firm is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding assets), thereby adversely affecting the Firms revenues and capital levels. Conversely, a low interest rate environment may compress net interest margins, reducing the amounts that the Firm earns on its investment securities portfolio, or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) asset, thereby reducing the Firms net interest income and other revenues. The Firms consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. domestic economic conditions, including U.S. interest ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I rates, the rate of unemployment, housing prices, the level of consumer confidence, changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies. Sustained low growth in the U.S. economy could diminish demand for the products and services offered by the Firms consumer businesses, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. In addition, adverse economic conditions, such as economic dislocations in certain geographies due to high levels of unemployment resulting from declining industrial or manufacturing activity, or other market or economic factors, could lead to an increase in mortgage, credit card, auto, student and other loan delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce the Firms earnings. The Firms earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by changes in government policies that affect consumers, including those relating to medical insurance, immigration, employment status and taxation, as well as governmental policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as infrastructure spending and global trade, which could result in, among other things, higher inflation or reductions in consumer disposable income. Widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the Firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis, and may adversely affect the credit markets and the Firms businesses. Credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to Firm-specific events and circumstances, but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in the Firms credit spreads will impact, positively or negatively, the Firms earnings on certain liabilities that are recorded at fair value. Sudden and significant volatility in the prices of securities and other assets (including loans and derivatives) may curtail the trading markets for such securities and assets, make it difficult to sell or hedge such securities and assets, adversely affect the Firms profitability, capital or liquidity, or increase the Firms funding costs. The Federal Reserve has recently observed that market volatility may be exacerbated by regulatory restrictions, as market participants that are subject to the Volcker Rule are likely to decrease their market-making activities, and thereby constrain market liquidity, during periods of market stress. In addition, in a difficult or less liquid market environment, the Firms risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for the Firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants or widespread market dislocations. Sustained volatility in the financial markets may also negatively affect consumer or investor confidence, which could lead to lower client activity and decreased revenue for the Firm. Credit Risk The financial condition of JPMorgan Chases clients and counterparties, particularly other financial institutions, could adversely affect the Firm. The Firm routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, investment managers and other types of financial institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Firm to the credit risk of its counterparties and, in some cases, disputes and litigation in the event of a default by the counterparty or client. Disputes with counterparties may also arise regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts, including with respect to the value of underlying collateral, which could cause the Firm to incur unexpected costs, including transaction, operational, legal and litigation costs, or result in credit losses, all of which may impair the Firms ability to manage effectively its credit risk exposure from these products. The failure of a significant market participant, or concerns about a default by such an institution, could also lead to significant liquidity problems for, or losses or defaults by, other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect the Firm. In addition, in recent years the perceived interrelationship among financial institutions has also led to claims by other market participants and regulators that the Firm and other financial institutions have allegedly violated anti-trust or anti-competition laws by colluding to manipulate markets, prices or indices, and there is no assurance that such allegations will not arise in the same or similar contexts in the future. As part of providing clearing services, the Firm is a member of a number of CCPs, and may be required to pay a portion of the losses incurred by such organizations as a result of the default of other members. As a clearing member, the Firm is also exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate through the maintenance of adequate collateral. In addition, the Firm can be exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to such clients. If a client for which the Firm provides such services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the Firm may suffer losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with various parties, including one or more CCPs, or the clients bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or involved in regulatory investigations. All of such events can increase the Firms operational and litigation costs and may result in losses if any collateral received by the Firm is insufficient to cover such losses. During periods of market stress or illiquidity, the Firms credit risk also may be further increased when the Firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to the Firm. Further, disputes with obligors concerning the valuation of collateral could increase in ##TABLE_START 12   ##TABLE_ENDtimes of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and the Firm could suffer losses during such periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral. Concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses. JPMorgan Chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when clients or counterparties are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of the Firms borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the credit quality of other borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries and thereby could exacerbate the Firms credit risk exposure and potentially increase its losses, including mark-to-market losses in its trading businesses. Similarly, challenging economic conditions affecting a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of the Firms borrowers or counterparties, not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located, or about the ability of customers of the Firms consumer businesses living in such areas or working in such affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to the Firm. Although the Firm regularly monitors various segments of its exposures to assess potential concentration or contagion risks, the Firms efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against concentration risks may not be successful. In addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the Firms inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce the Firms positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but may also increase the level of risk-weighted assets (RWA) on the Firms balance sheet, thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs, all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the Firms businesses. Liquidity Risk If JPMorgan Chase does not effectively manage its liquidity, its business could suffer. JPMorgan Chases liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses. Some potential conditions that could impair the Firms liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise experiencing disruption, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including, among others, commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities (SPEs) or other entities), difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets, default by a CCP or other counterparty, unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, and lack of market or customer confidence in the Firm or financial markets in general. These conditions may be caused by events over which the Firm has little or no control. The widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the Firms cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity (such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, credit card receivables and other assets) during that time, and there is no assurance that these severe conditions could not occur in the future. If the Firms access to stable and low cost sources of funding, such as bank deposits, is reduced, the Firm may need to raise alternative funding which may be more expensive or of limited availability. In addition, the Firms cost of funding could be affected by actions that the Firm may take in order to satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements, to lower its GSIB systemic risk score, to satisfy the amount of eligible LTD that the Firm must have outstanding under the TLAC rules, to address obligations under the Firms Resolution Plan or to satisfy regulatory requirements in non-U.S. jurisdictions relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities. JPMorgan Chase is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to fund payments of dividends on its equity securities, principal and interest payments on its debt securities and redemptions and repurchases of its outstanding securities. As a holding company, JPMorgan Chase  Co. is dependent on the earnings of its subsidiaries to meet its payment obligations. Under the arrangements contemplated by the Firms Resolution Plan, JPMorgan Chase  Co. has established a new intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the IHC), and has contributed to the IHC the stock of substantially all of its direct subsidiaries (other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) as well as other assets and intercompany indebtedness owing to it. Under these arrangements, JPMorgan Chase  Co. is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received by it from securities issuances (including, without limitation, issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). As a result of these arrangements, JPMorgan Chase  Co.s ability to pay interest on its debt securities and dividends on its equity securities, to redeem or repurchase its outstanding securities and to fulfill its other payment obligations is dependent on it receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to restrictions on its dividend distributions, capital adequacy and liquidity coverage requirements, and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to JPMorgan Chase  Co., and the IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to JPMorgan Chase  Co. if certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Firms management or Board of Directors. These regulatory restrictions and limitations on the payments that JPMorgan Chase  Co. is permitted to receive from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC could reduce or hinder its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations, or result in JPMorgan Chase  Co. seeking protection under bankruptcy laws at a time earlier than ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I would have been the case absent the existence of such thresholds. Reductions in JPMorgan Chases credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding, as well as the value of debt obligations issued by the Firm. JPMorgan Chase  Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are currently rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate both general and firm- and industry-specific factors when determining their credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, legal expenses, assumptions surrounding government support, and ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries. Although the Firm closely monitors and manages, to the extent it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings, there is no assurance that the Firms credit ratings will not be lowered in the future, or that any such downgrade would not occur at times of broader market instability when the Firms options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low. Furthermore, a reduction in the Firms credit ratings could reduce the Firms access to capital markets, materially increase the cost of issuing securities, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted, contractually or otherwise, to do business with or lend to the Firm, thereby curtailing the Firms business operations and reducing its profitability. In addition, any such reduction in credit ratings may increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase  Co. and its subsidiaries and, as a result, could adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations that JPMorgan Chase  Co. and its subsidiaries have issued or may issue in the future. Legal Risk JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the Firm. JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against the Firm may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Firm, which could materially and adversely affect the Firms business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious harm to the Firms reputation. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that the Firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations. In addition, and as noted above, the Firms businesses and operations are also subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Regulators and other government agencies examine the operations of the Firm and its subsidiaries on both a routine- and targeted-exam basis, and there is no assurance that they will not pursue additional regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against the Firm in the future. A violation of law or regulation by another financial institution is likely to give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by the Firm. For example, various regulatory and governmental agencies have made inquiries to the Firm about its sales practices with retail customers, including, among other matters, the Firms incentive compensation structures related to such practices. In addition, a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions. These and other initiatives from U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities and officials may subject the Firm to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause the Firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm the Firms reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing the Firms profitability, or result in collateral consequences as discussed above. Other Business Risks Any significant failure by the Firms management to anticipate and respond quickly and appropriately to changes in the Firms operating environment or trends affecting the financial services industry, to make prudent decisions regarding the Firms strategy or to execute on that strategy could adversely affect the Firms competitive standing and its earnings and future results of operations. The Firm operates in many jurisdictions and offers a wide variety of products and services to its clients and customers. The Firms strategies concerning the products and services that it will offer, the geographies in which it will operate, the types of clients and customers that it will serve and the counterparties with which it will do business, and the methods and distribution channels by which it will offer its products and services, will all affect the Firms competitive standing and its results of operations. If the Firms management makes choices about the Firms business strategies and goals that later prove to have been incorrect, does not accurately assess the competitive landscape and the industry trends affecting the Firm or does not formulate effective business plans to address the Firms near- and longer-term strategic priorities, as well as the changing regulatory and market environments in which the Firm operates both in the U.S. and abroad, the franchise values and growth prospects of the Firms businesses will suffer and revenues will decline. The prospects of the Firm will also depend on managements ability to execute effectively against the Firms strategic plans and to manage the Firms resources to grow revenues, control expenses and return capital to the Firms shareholders. Any significant failure by the Firms Board of Directors to exercise appropriate oversight of managements strategic decisions, or any significant failure by the Firms management to develop and execute on the Firms strategic plans and business initiatives, or the ineffectual ##TABLE_START 14   ##TABLE_ENDimplementation of business decisions, the failure of the Firms products or services or dealings with customers to meet customer expectations, inadequate responses to regulatory requirements, the failure to react quickly to changes in market conditions or structure, or the failure to develop the necessary operational, technology, risk, financial, and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage the Firm and its various businesses could adversely affect the Firms competitive standing and negatively affect the Firms earnings and future results of operations. JPMorgan Chases operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary and political developments in the U.S. and around the world. JPMorgan Chases businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities and agencies. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the U.S. and the return earned on those loans and investments. Changes in Federal Reserve policies (as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of non-U.S. central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies, such as pegging the exchange rate of their currency to the currencies of others) are beyond the Firms control and may be difficult to predict, and consequently, unanticipated changes in these policies could have a negative impact on the Firms activities and results of operations. The Firms businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and market-making in securities, loans and other obligations of companies worldwide. These risks include, among others, negative effects from slowing growth rates or recessionary economic conditions, or the risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, in the countries or regions in which such companies operate, as well as the other risks and considerations as described further below. Several of the Firms businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities. These activities can expose the Firm to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputation risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations, claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government, any or all of which could adversely affect the Firms financial condition and results of operations. Further, various countries or regions in which the Firm operates or invests, or in which the Firm may do so in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. In some cases, concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries can cause a contraction of available credit and reduced activity among trading partners or create market volatility that could lead to market contagion affecting other countries in the same region or beyond the region. In addition, governments in particular countries or regions in which the Firm or its client do business may choose to adopt protectionist economic or trade policies in response to concerns about domestic economic conditions which could lead to diminished cross-border trade and financing activity within that country or region, all of which could negatively affect the Firms business and earnings in those jurisdictions. Political and economic uncertainty can also undermine consumer, business and investor confidence, and thereby contribute to market volatility. For example, uncertainties concerning the timing and terms of the U.K.s planned departure from the EU could have an adverse effect on global financial markets and may adversely impact global economic conditions more generally. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the arrangements agreed between the U.K. and the EU, including with respect to the ability of financial services companies to engage in business in the EU from legal entities organized in or operating from the U.K., it is possible that under some scenarios, the Firm may need to make changes to its legal entity structure and operations and the locations in which it operates, which might result in a less efficient operating model across the Firms European legal entities. Accordingly, it is possible that political or economic developments in certain countries, even in countries in which the Firm does not conduct business or have operations or engages in only limited activities, may adversely affect the Firm. The Firm must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by OFAC and similar multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside U.S., including, most recently, sanctions targeted at individuals and companies in Russia. A violation of a sanction or embargo program could subject the Firm, and individual employees, to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties. JPMorgan Chases operations in emerging markets may be hindered by local political, social and economic factors, and may be subject to additional compliance costs and risks. Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the U.S. and other developed markets in which the Firm currently operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, low or negative growth, or defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt, among other negative conditions, or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment. In addition, these countries, as well as certain more developed countries, have recently been more susceptible to unfavorable political, social or economic developments; these developments have in the past resulted in, and may in the future lead to, social unrest, ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I general strikes and demonstrations, crime and corruption, security and personal safety issues, outbreaks of hostilities, overthrow of incumbent governments, terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord, all of which can adversely affect the Firms operations or investments in such countries. Political, social or economic disruption or dislocation in certain countries or regions in which the Firm conducts its businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations. Less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the Firms operations in those countries, including, among others, the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions; the promulgation of conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations; uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations; difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive; and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions, the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies. Revenue from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations, as well as due to governmental actions including monetary policies, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, and changes in laws and regulations. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets. Also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can affect, and in the past conditions of these types have affected, the Firms operations and investments in another country or countries, including the Firms operations in the U.S. As a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the Firms business and results of operations. Conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the Firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. There can be no assurance that the Firm will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems or that the Firm will be able to develop effective working relationships with local regulators. In addition, the Firm can also incur higher costs, and face greater compliance risks, in structuring and operating its businesses outside the U.S. to comply with U.S. anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. JPMorgan Chase relies on the effectiveness and integrity of its processes, operational systems and employees, and those of third parties, and certain failures of such processes or systems, or errors or misconduct by such employees, could materially and adversely affect the Firms operations. JPMorgan Chases businesses are dependent on the Firms ability to process, record and monitor an increasingly large number of complex transactions and to do so on a faster and more frequent basis. The Firms front- and back-office trading systems similarly rely on their access to, and on the functionality of, the operational systems maintained by third parties such as clearing and payment systems, central counterparties, securities exchanges and data processing and technology companies. If the Firms financial, accounting, trading or other data processing systems, or the operational systems of third parties on which the Firms businesses are dependent, are unable to meet these increasingly demanding standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Firm could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, as the speed, frequency, volume and complexity of transactions (and the requirements to report such transactions on a real-time basis to clients, regulators and financial intermediaries) increases, the risk of human and/or systems error in connection with such transactions increases, and it becomes more challenging to maintain the Firms operational systems and infrastructure. The effective functioning of the Firms operational systems is also dependent on the competence and reliability of its employees, as well as the employees of third parties on whom the Firm relies for technological support, and the Firm could be materially and adversely affected by a significant operational breakdown or failure caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of the Firm or a third party. In addition, when the Firm changes processes or introduces new products and services or new connectivity solutions, the Firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Any of these occurrences could diminish the Firms ability to operate one or more of its businesses, or result in potential liability to clients and customers, increased operating expenses, higher litigation costs (including fines and sanctions), damage to reputation, impairment of liquidity, regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Firm. Third parties with which the Firm does business, including retailers, data aggregators and other third parties with which the Firms customers do business, can also be sources of operational risk to the Firm, particularly where activities of customers or such third parties are beyond the Firms security and control systems, such as through the use of the internet, personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services. As the Firms interconnectivity with customers and other third parties increases, the Firm increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to their systems. Security breaches affecting the Firms customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting such other third ##TABLE_START 16   ##TABLE_ENDparties, may require the Firm to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Firm or its customers, thereby increasing the Firms operational costs and potentially diminishing customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, and the increased importance of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially impact the Firms ability to conduct business. The Firms businesses are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals (including clients, clients clients, employees of the Firm and its suppliers and other third parties). Ensuring that the Firms collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can increase the Firms operating costs, impact the development of new products or services and require significant oversight by management, and may require the Firm to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. Furthermore, the Firm may not be able to ensure that all of its clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and the Firm, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused (in situations where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties), the Firm could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of the Firms measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause the Firm to lose customers or potential customers for its products and services and thereby reduce the Firms revenues. Accordingly, any failure or perceived failure by the Firm to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage the Firms reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses. The Firm may be subject to disruptions of its operational systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the Firms control, which may include, for example, security breaches (as discussed further below); electrical or telecommunications outages; failures of computer servers or other damage to the Firms property or assets; natural disasters or severe weather conditions; health emergencies or pandemics; or events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. JPMorgan Chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure that the Firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. While the Firm believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate, there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the Firm or its customers and clients. Any failures or disruptions of the Firms systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients, adversely affect the Firms business and results of operations by subjecting the Firm to losses or liability, or require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption, as well as by exposing the Firm to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance. A breach in the security of JPMorgan Chases systems, or those of other market participants, could disrupt the Firms businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage the Firms reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the Firm. Although JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Firms computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Firm and its customers and clients, there is no assurance that all of the Firms security measures will provide absolute security. JPMorgan Chase and other companies, as well as governmental and political organizations, have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites, networks or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, including through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. The Firm is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious code and viruses, and has experienced several significant distributed denial-of-service attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties which were intended to disrupt online banking services. Despite the Firms efforts to ensure the security and integrity of its systems, it is possible that the Firm may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to its systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types inside or outside the Firm, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments, and such third parties may seek to gain access to the Firms systems either directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of the Firms systems. These risks may increase in the future as the Firm continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications. Given the breadth of the Firms operations, the high volume of transactions that it processes, the large number of customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which the Firm does business, and the proliferation and increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, a particular cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected. The extent of a particular cyberattack and the steps that the Firm may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation could be completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. During such time the Firm may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the Firms systems or the systems of another market participant could cause serious negative consequences for the Firm, including significant disruption of the Firms operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, misappropriation of confidential information of the Firm or that of its clients, customers, counterparties or employees, or damage to computers or systems of the Firm and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Firm or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Firms security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to the Firms reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Firm. Risk Management JPMorgan Chases framework for managing risks and its risk management procedures and practices may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to the Firm, thereby resulting in losses. JPMorgan Chases risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the Firm. The Firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which the Firm is subject. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the Firms risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that the Firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified. In addition, the Firm relies on data to aggregate and assess its various risk exposures, and any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of the Firms data aggregation and validation procedures could result in ineffective risk management practices or inaccurate risk reporting. Any lapse in the Firms risk management framework and governance structure or other inadequacies in the design or implementation of the Firms risk management framework, governance, procedures, practices, models or risk reporting systems could, individually or in the aggregate, cause unexpected losses for the Firm, materially and adversely affect the Firms financial condition and results of operations, require significant resources to remediate any risk management deficiency, attract heightened regulatory scrutiny, expose the Firm to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings, subject the Firm to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firms reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence. The Firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses inherent in its credit exposures, and also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the Firm in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to the Firms financial results and condition, and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the Firms borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the possibility that the Firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the Firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies. Certain of the Firms trading transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that the Firm does not own; if the Firm is unable to obtain such securities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery, this could cause the Firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays, which could damage the Firms reputation and ability to transact future business. In addition, in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis, the Firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, the Firm may be exposed to market and operational losses. Many of the Firms risk management strategies or techniques have a basis in historical market behavior, and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on managements subjective judgment. For example, many models used by the Firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements. These sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited and could again limit the effectiveness of the Firms risk management strategies, causing the Firm to incur losses. Many of the models used by the Firm are subject to review not only by the Firms Model Risk function but also by the Firms regulators in order that the Firm may utilize such models in connection with the Firms calculations of market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel III. The Firm may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit its ability to expand its businesses, if such models do not receive approval by its regulators. ##TABLE_START 18   ##TABLE_ENDIn addition, the Firm must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with vendors and other third parties that provide services to the Firm. These requirements apply to the Firm both under general guidance issued by its banking regulators and, more specifically, under certain of the consent orders to which the Firm has been subject. The Firm has incurred and expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships. Failure by the Firm to appropriately assess and manage third party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could result in potential liability to clients and customers, fines, penalties or judgments imposed by the Firms regulators, increased operating expenses and harm to the Firms reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Firm. Other Risks Actions or inaction by employees of the Firm may cause harm to the Firms clients and customers, damage the Firms reputation, negatively impact the Firms culture and lead to liability and regulatory and other governmental actions against the Firm. JPMorgan Chases employees interact with clients, customers and counterparties every day, and they are expected through their conduct to demonstrate the Firms values and exhibit the culture and behaviors that are an integral part of the Firms How We Do Business Principles, including the Firms commitment to do first class business in a first class way. If an employee takes an action (including a failure to act) that does not comply with the Firms Code of Conduct, is inconsistent with the Firms How We Do Business Principles or that otherwise harms clients, consumers or the market, such as improperly selling and marketing the Firms product or services, acting illegally with others to establish market prices, improperly hiring individuals related to politically exposed persons or misappropriating Firm property or confidential or proprietary information or technology belonging to the Firm, its customers or third parties, such activities could give rise to litigation, regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions, and judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, and lead to requirements that the Firm restructure certain of its operations and activities, all of which could harm the Firms reputation or result in collateral consequences. Although the Firm endeavors to embed culture and conduct risk management throughout an employees life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance management, as well as through the Firms promotion and compensation processes, employees of the Firm have, from time to time in the past, engaged in improper or illegal conduct resulting in litigation as well as settlements involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements and non-prosecution agreements, as well as other civil and criminal settlements with regulators and other governmental entities, and there is no assurance that further inappropriate actions by employees will not occur or that any such actions will always be deterred or quickly prevented. The financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chases inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations. JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment, and the Firm expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors of the Firm include other banks and financial institutions, trading, advisory and investment management firms, finance companies and technology companies and other firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, payment processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. New technologies have required and could require the Firm to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. Ongoing or increased competition, on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation, price or other factors, may put downward pressure on prices and fees for the Firms products and services or may cause the Firm to lose market share. In addition, the failure of any of the Firms businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions or underperformance (relative to competitors or to benchmarks), could impact the Firms ability to retain clients and customers or attract new clients and customers, thereby reducing the Firms revenues. Increased competition also may require the Firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive. The Firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations. Non-U.S. competitors of the Firms wholesale businesses outside the U.S. are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. The more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to U.S. financial services institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase, can put the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to its non-U.S. competitors, including prohibiting the Firm from engaging in certain transactions, imposing higher capital and liquidity requirements on the Firm, making the Firms pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the Firms cost structure for providing certain products, all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the Firms wholesale businesses. ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success. JPMorgan Chases employees are the Firms most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The Firm endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees. There is the potential for changes in immigration policies in multiple jurisdictions around the world, including the U.S., and to the extent that immigration policies were to unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for qualified employees to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which the Firm has operations or conducts its business, the Firm could be adversely affected. The Firm also seeks to retain a pipeline of senior employees with superior talent, augmented from time to time by external hires, to provide continuity of succession for the Firms Operating Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer position, and senior positions below the Operating Committee. The Firm regularly reviews candidates for senior management positions to assess whether they currently are ready for a next-level role. In addition, the Firms Board of Directors is deeply involved in succession planning, including review of the succession plans for the Chief Executive Officer and the members of the Operating Committee. If the Firm were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer or members of the Operating Committee, the Firms performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected. JPMorgan Chases financial statements are based in part on estimates and judgments which, if incorrect, could result in unexpected losses in the future. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP), JPMorgan Chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation, among other items. Certain of the Firms financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, instruments in the investment securities portfolio, certain loans, MSRs, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Firms financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If estimates or judgments underlying the Firms financial statements are incorrect, the Firm may experience material losses. Lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the Firms operations, profitability or reputation. There can be no assurance that the Firms disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect the Firms business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose the Firm to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject it to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firms reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence. Damage to JPMorgan Chases reputation could damage its businesses. Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to the Firms ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. Damage to the Firms reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the Firms business and prospects. Harm to the Firms reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, security breaches, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. The Firms reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of an affiliate, joint-venturer or merchant banking portfolio company, or a vendor or other third party with which the Firm does business, to comply with laws or regulations. In addition, the Firms reputation or prospects may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding the Firm, whether or not true, that may be posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet, and this risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels.  Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as the Firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among the Firms clients. The failure or perceived failure to adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest has given rise to litigation and enforcement actions. Likewise, the failure or perceived failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, to treat customers and clients fairly, to provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or to handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations has given rise to litigation and enforcement actions. In the future, a failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost ##TABLE_START 20   ##TABLE_ENDrevenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to the Firms reputation. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the Firms reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms during and after the financial crisis, including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions or that a financial institution had acted inappropriately with respect to the methods employed in offering products to customers, have damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole. Should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the Firms reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the Firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the damage to its reputation could not adversely affect the Firms earnings and results of operations, or that damage to the Firms reputation will not impair the Firms ability to retain its existing or attract new customers, investors and employees.

The internal control framework promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), Internal Control  Integrated Framework (COSO 2013) provides guidance for designing, implementing and conducting internal control and assessing its effectiveness. The Firm used the COSO 2013 framework to assess the effectiveness of the Firms internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 . See Managements report on internal control over financial reporting on page 139 . As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firms management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the future. For further information, see Managements report on internal control over financial reporting on page 139 . There was no change in the Firms internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended  December 31, 2016 , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firms internal control over financial reporting.

Business. Overview JPMorgan Chase  Co.  (JPMorgan Chase or the Firm), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States of America (U.S.) , with operations worldwide; the Firm had $2.5 trillion in assets and $255.7 billion in stockholders equity as of  December 31, 2017 . The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands, the Firm serves millions of customers in the U.S. and many of the worlds most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients. JPMorgan Chases principal bank subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), a national banking association with U.S. branches in 23 states, and Chase Bank USA, National Association (Chase Bank USA, N.A.), a national banking association that is the Firms principal credit card-issuing bank. JPMorgan Chases principal nonbank subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMorgan Securities), a U.S. broker-dealer. The bank and non-bank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase operate nationally as well as through overseas branches and subsidiaries, representative offices and subsidiary foreign banks. The Firms principal operating subsidiary in the U.K. is J.P. Morgan Securities plc, a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Firms website is www.jpmorganchase.com. JPMorgan Chase makes available free of charge, through its website, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) at www.sec.gov. The Firm has adopted, and posted on its website, a Code of Conduct for all employees of the Firm and a Code of Ethics for its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and all other professionals of the Firm worldwide serving in a finance, accounting, tax or investor relations role. Business segments JPMorgan Chases activities are organized, for management reporting purposes, into four major reportable business segments, as well as a Corporate  segment. The Firms consumer business is the Consumer  Community Banking (CCB) segment. The Firms wholesale business segments are Corporate  Investment Bank (CIB), Commercial Banking (CB), and Asset  Wealth Management (AWM). A description of the Firms business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases is provided in the Business segment results section of Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MDA), beginning on page 40 and in Note 31 . Competition JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in a highly competitive environment. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, investment managers, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, financial technology companies, and other companies engaged in providing similar products and services. The Firms businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firms products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. With respect to some of its geographies and products, JPMorgan Chase competes globally; with respect to others, the Firm competes on a national or regional basis. The Firms ability to compete also depends on its ability to attract and retain professional and other personnel, and on its reputation. It is likely that competition in the financial services industry will continue to be intense as the Firms businesses compete with other financial institutions that may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies or that operate under different rules and regulatory regimes than the Firm, or with companies that provide new or innovative products or services that the Firm does not provide. Supervision and regulation The Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as well as the applicable laws of each of the various jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business.  The Firm has experienced an extended period of significant change in regulation which has had and could continue to have significant consequences for how the Firm conducts business in the U.S. and abroad. The Firm devotes substantial resources to complying with existing and new laws, rules and regulations, while, at the same time, endeavoring to best meet the needs and expectations of its customers, clients and shareholders. As a result of legislative and regulatory changes and expanded supervision, the Firm has implemented and refined policies, procedures and controls, and made adjustments to its business and operations, legal entity structure, and capital and liquidity management. The combined effect of numerous rule-makings by multiple governmental agencies and regulators, and the potential conflicts or inconsistencies among such rules, continue to present challenges and risks to the Firms business and operations. ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I Because regulatory changes are ongoing, the Firm cannot currently quantify all of the possible effects on its business and operations of the significant changes that are underway. For more information, see Risk Factors on pages 826 . Financial holding company: Consolidated supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) . As a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company, JPMorgan Chase is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve acts as an umbrella regulator and certain of JPMorgan Chases subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional regulatory authorities based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries. For example, JPMorgan Chases national bank subsidiaries, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., are subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and, with respect to certain matters, by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC). Certain non-bank subsidiaries, such as the Firms U.S. broker-dealers, are subject to supervision and regulation by the SEC, and subsidiaries of the Firm that engage in certain futures-related and swaps-related activities  are subject to supervision and regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). J.P. Morgan Securities plc, is a U.K. bank licensed within the European Economic Area (the EEA) to undertake all banking activity and is regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (the PRA), a subsidiary of the Bank of England which has responsibility for prudential regulation of banks and other systemically important institutions, and by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates conduct matters for all market participants. The Firms other non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the banking and securities regulatory authorities in the countries in which they operate. See Securities and broker-dealer regulation, Investment management regulation and Derivatives regulation below. In addition, the Firms consumer activities are subject to supervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)  and to regulation under various state statutes which are enforced by the respective states Attorney General.  Scope of permissible business activities. The Bank Holding Company Act generally restricts BHCs from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely-related activities. Financial holding companies generally can engage in a broader range of financial activities than are otherwise permissible for BHCs,  including underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities, and making merchant banking investments in non-financial companies.  The Federal Reserve has the authority to limit a financial holding companys ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities if the financial holding company or any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet the applicable eligibility requirements (including requirements that the  financial holding company and each of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries maintain their status as well-capitalized and well-managed).  The Federal Reserve may also impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may, for example, require divestiture of the holding companys depository institutions if the deficiencies persist. Federal regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies. In addition, a financial holding company must obtain Federal Reserve approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both in the U.S. and internationally, as further described under Regulation of acquisitions below.  Activities restrictions under the Volcker Rule. Section 619 (the Volcker Rule) of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) prohibits banking entities, including the Firm , from engaging in certain proprietary trading activities, subject to exceptions for underwriting, market-making, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. In addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, covered funds (as defined by the Volcker Rule) and imposes limits on certain transactions between the Firm and its sponsored funds (see JPMorgan Chases subsidiary banks  Restrictions on transactions with affiliates below). The period during which banking entities were required to bring covered funds into conformance with the Volcker Rule ended on July 21, 2017. The Volcker Rule requires banking entities to establish comprehensive compliance programs reasonably designed to help ensure and monitor compliance with the restrictions under the Volcker Rule, including, in order to distinguish permissible from impermissible risk-taking activities, the measurement, monitoring and reporting of certain key metrics. Capital and liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve establishes capital and leverage requirements for the Firm and evaluates its compliance with such requirements. The OCC establishes similar capital and leverage requirements for the Firms national banking subsidiaries . For more information about the applicable requirements relating to risk-based capital and leverage, see Capital Risk Management on pages 8291 and Note 26 . Under Basel III, bank holding companies and banks are required to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests: the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). In the U.S., the final LCR rule (U.S. LCR) became effective on January 1, 2015. In April 2016, the U.S. banking regulators issued a proposed rule for NSFR, but no final rule has been issued. For additional information on LCR, see Liquidity Risk Management on pages 9297 . On December 19, 2016, the Federal Reserve published final U.S. LCR public disclosure requirements. Beginning in the second quarter of 2017, the Firm began disclosing its ##TABLE_START 2   ##TABLE_ENDconsolidated LCR pursuant to the U.S. LCR rule.  On September 8, 2016, the Federal Reserve published the framework that will apply to the setting of the countercyclical capital buffer. The Federal Reserve reviews the amount of this buffer at least annually, and on December 1, 2017, the Federal Reserve reaffirmed setting this buffer at 0%.  Banking supervisors globally continue to consider refinements and enhancements to the Basel III capital framework for financial institutions. On December 7, 2017, the Basel Committee issued Basel III: Finalizing post-crisis reforms (Basel III Reforms), which seeks to reduce excessive variability in RWA and converge capital requirements between Standardized and Advanced approaches. The Basel III Reforms include revisions to both the standardized and internal ratings-based approach for credit risk, streamlining of the available approaches under the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) framework, a revised approach for operational risk, revisions to the measurement and calibration of the leverage ratio, and a capital floor based on 72.5% of the revised Standardized approaches. The Basel Committee expects national regulatory authorities to implement the Basel III Reforms in the laws of their respective jurisdictions and to require banking organizations subject to such laws to meet most of the revised requirements by January 1, 2022, with certain elements being phased in through January 1, 2027.  U.S. banking regulators will now propose requirements applicable to U.S. financial institutions.  Stress tests. The Federal Reserve has adopted supervisory stress tests for large bank holding companies, including JPMorgan Chase, which form part of the Federal Reserves annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) framework. Under the framework, the Firm must conduct semi-annual company-run stress tests and, in addition, must submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by the Firm and the Federal Reserve. In reviewing the Firms capital plan, the Federal Reserve considers both quantitative and qualitative factors. Qualitative assessments include, among other things, the comprehensiveness of the plan, the assumptions and analysis underlying the plan, and the extent to which the Firm has satisfied certain supervisory matters related to the Firms processes and analyses, including the design and operational effectiveness of the controls governing such processes. Moreover, the Firm is required to receive a notice of non-objection from the Federal Reserve before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to perform separate, similar annual stress tests. The Firm publishes each year the results of its mid-cycle stress tests under the Firms internally-developed severely adverse scenario and the results of its (and its two primary subsidiary banks) annual stress tests under the supervisory severely adverse scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The Firm is required to file its 2018 annual CCAR submission on April 5, 2018. Results will be published by the Federal Reserve by June 30, 2018, with disclosures of results by BHCs, including the Firm, to follow within 15 days. The mid-cycle capital stress test submissions are due on October 5, 2018 and BHCs, including the Firm , will publish results by November 4, 2018.  For additional information on the Firms CCAR, see Capital Risk Management on pages 8291 . In December 2017, the Federal Reserve released a set of proposals intended to provide more detailed disclosure and transparency concerning the Federal Reserves approach, design and governance of the supervisory stress testing process. The proposals were open for public comment through January 22, 2018.  Enhanced prudential standards. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), among other things, recommends prudential standards and reporting and disclosure requirements to the Federal Reserve for systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), such as JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve has adopted several rules to implement the heightened prudential standards, including final rules relating to risk management and corporate governance of subject BHCs. BHCs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets are required to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, and their boards of directors are required to conduct appropriate oversight of their risk management activities. For information on liquidity measures, see Liquidity Risk Management on pages 9297 . Orderly liquidation authority and resolution and recovery. As a BHC with assets of $50 billion or more, the Firm is required to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for resolution under the Bankruptcy Code in the event of material distress or failure (a resolution plan).  On December 19, 2017, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC announced joint determinations on the 2017 resolution plans of eight systemically important domestic banking institutions, including that of JPMorgan Chase, and extended the filing deadline for the next resolution plan for each of these entities until July 1, 2019.  The agencies determined that JPMorgan Chases 2017 resolution plan did not have any deficiencies, which are weaknesses severe enough to trigger a resubmission process that could result in more stringent requirements, or any shortcomings, which are less-severe weaknesses that would need to be addressed in the next resolution plan. For more information about the Firms resolution plan, see Risk Factors on pages 826 . Certain financial companies, including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its subsidiaries, can also be subjected to resolution under an orderly liquidation authority. The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States, must first make certain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk determinations, and action must be recommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent such actions, the Firm , as a BHC, would remain subject to resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. In December 2013, the FDIC issued a draft policy statement ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I describing its single point of entry strategy for resolution of systemically important financial institutions under the orderly liquidation authority. This strategy seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of the BHC open and impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the holding company in receivership according to their statutory order of priority. For further information see Risk Factors on pages 826 . The FDIC also requires each insured depository institution (IDI) with $50 billion or more in assets, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., to provide an IDI resolution plan. The Firm has a comprehensive recovery plan detailing the actions it would take to avoid failure by remaining well-capitalized and well-funded in the case of an adverse event. JPMorgan Chase has provided the Federal Reserve with comprehensive confidential supervisory information and analyses about the Firms businesses, legal entities and corporate governance and about its crisis management governance, capabilities and available alternatives to generate liquidity and capital in severe market circumstances. The OCC has published guidelines establishing standards for recovery planning by insured national banks, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. have submitted their recovery plans to the OCC.  In addition, certain of the Firms non-U.S. subsidiaries are subject to resolution and recovery planning requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate.  Regulators in the U.S. and abroad have proposed and implemented measures designed to address the possibility or perception that large financial institutions, including the Firm, may be too big to fail, and to provide safeguards so that, if a large financial institution does fail, it can be resolved without the use of public funds. Higher capital surcharges on global systemically important banks (GSIBs), requirements for certain large bank holding companies to maintain a minimum amount of long-term debt to facilitate orderly resolution of those firms (referred to as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)), and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) protocol relating to the close-out of derivatives transactions during the resolution of a large cross-border financial institution, are examples of initiatives to address too big to fail.  For further information on the GSIB framework and TLAC, see Capital Risk Management on pages 8291 and Risk Factors on pages 826 , and on the ISDA close-out protocol, see Derivatives regulation below.  Holding company as source of strength for bank subsidiaries . JPMorgan Chase  Co. is required to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the Federal Reserve at times when the Firm might otherwise determine not to provide it.  Regulation of acquisitions. Acquisitions by bank holding companies and their banks are subject to multiple requirements by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. For example, financial holding companies and bank holding companies are required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before they may acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of an unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by financial companies are prohibited if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies. In addition, for certain acquisitions, the Firm must provide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company with over $10 billion in assets that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature. JPMorgan Chases subsidiary banks:  The Firms two principal subsidiary banks, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., are FDIC-insured national banks regulated by the OCC. As national banks, the activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. are limited to those specifically authorized under the National Bank Act and related interpretations by the OCC. FDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance fund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits and is funded through assessments on banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. Changes in the methodology used to calculate such assessments, resulting from the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, significantly increased the assessments that the Firms bank subsidiaries pay annually to the FDIC. The FDIC instituted a new assessment surcharge on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion in order to raise the reserve ratio for the FDIC deposit insurance fund. FDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC could be appointed as the conservator or receiver under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA).  The FDIC has broad powers to transfer any assets and liabilities without the approval of the institutions creditors.  Cross-guarantee. An FDIC-insured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the FDIC if another FDIC-insured institution that is under common control with such institution is in default or is deemed to be in danger of default (commonly referred to as cross-guarantee liability). An FDIC cross-guarantee claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution.  Prompt corrective action and early remediation. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. While these regulations apply only to banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against the parent BHC, such as ##TABLE_START 4   ##TABLE_ENDJPMorgan Chase  Co., based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In certain instances, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary.  OCC Heightened Standards. The OCC has established guidelines setting forth heightened standards for large banks. The guidelines establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks. While the bank can use certain components of the parent companys risk governance framework, the framework must ensure that the banks risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from the parent for risk management purposes. The banks board or risk committee is responsible for approving the banks risk governance framework, providing active oversight of the banks risk-taking activities, and holding management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework. Restrictions on transactions with affiliates. The bank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase  (including subsidiaries of those banks)  are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, investments in stock or securities of, and derivatives, securities lending and certain other transactions with, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and certain other affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan Chase  Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from  such subsidiaries  unless the loans are secured in specified amounts and comply with certain other requirements. For more information, see Note  25 . In addition, the Volcker Rule imposes a prohibition on such transactions between any JPMorgan Chase entity and covered funds for which a JPMorgan Chase entity serves as the investment manager, investment advisor, commodity trading advisor or sponsor, as well as, subject to a limited exception, any covered fund controlled by such funds.  Dividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. See Note 25  for the amount of dividends that the Firms principal bank subsidiaries could pay, at January 1, 2018, to their respective bank holding companies without the approval of their banking regulators.  In addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the OCC and the Federal Reserve have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends of the bank subsidiaries they supervise , if, in the banking regulators opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank. Depositor preference. Under federal law, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and deposits in non-U.S. branches that are dually payable in the U.S. and in a non-U.S. branch) have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including public noteholders and depositors in non-U.S. branches. As a result, such persons could receive substantially less than the depositors in U.S. offices of the depository institution. CFPB regulation and supervision, and other consumer regulations. JPMorgan Chase and its national bank subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., are subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. These laws include the Truth-in-Lending, Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), Fair Credit Reporting, Fair Debt Collection Practice, Electronic Funds Transfer, Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) and Home Mortgage Disclosure Acts. The CFPB has authority to impose new disclosure requirements for certain consumer financial products and services. The CFPBs rule-making efforts have addressed mortgage-related topics, including ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requirements, appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higher-priced mortgages. The CFPB continues to issue informal guidance on a variety of topics (such as the collection of consumer debts and credit card marketing practices). Other areas of focus include sales incentives, pre-authorized electronic funds transfers, add-on products, matters involving consumer populations considered vulnerable by the CFPB, credit reporting, and the furnishing of credit scores to individuals. As part of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has authority to take enforcement actions against firms that offer certain products and services to consumers, including JPMorgan Chase. Securities and broker-dealer regulation: The Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and other non-bank broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations of the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the New York Stock Exchange, among others. The Firm conducts similar securities activities outside the U.S. subject to local regulatory requirements. In the U.K., those activities are conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc, a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and are regulated by the PRA and the FCA. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customers funds, the financing of clients purchases, capital structure, record-keeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers and employees. For information on the net capital of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and the applicable requirements relating to risk-based capital for J.P. Morgan Securities plc, see Broker-dealer regulatory capital on page 91 . In addition, rules adopted by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) have imposed (among other things) a new standard of care applicable to broker-dealers when dealing ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I with customers. For more information see Investment management regulation below.  Investment management regulation: The Firms asset and wealth management businesses are subject to significant regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding and management of client assets, offerings of funds and marketing activities. Certain of the Firms subsidiaries are registered with, and subject to oversight by, the SEC as investment advisers. As such, the Firms registered investment advisers are subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as various state securities laws. For information regarding investigations and litigation in connection with disclosures to clients related to proprietary products, see Note  29 . The Firms asset and wealth management businesses continue to be affected by ongoing rule-making and implementation of new regulations. The DOLs fiduciary rule, which became effective June 9, 2017, has significantly expanded the universe of persons viewed as investment advice fiduciaries to retirement plans and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA).  The prohibited transaction exemptions issued in connection with the rule require adherence to impartial conduct standards (including a requirement to act in the best interest of retirement clients), although compliance with requirements relating to conditions requiring new client contracts, implementation of policies and procedures, websites and other disclosures to both investors and the DOL have been delayed until July 1, 2019. Furthermore, the DOL is performing a review of the rule and the related exemptions in accordance with a February 2017 memorandum from the President. Subject to the outcome of the DOLs review, it is expected that the rule and related prohibited transaction exemptions will have a significant impact on the fee and compensation practices at financial institutions that offer investment advice to retail retirement clients.  In addition to the impact of the DOLs fiduciary rule, the Firms asset and wealth management businesses may be affected by ongoing rule-making and implementation of new regulations by the SEC and certain U.S. states relating to enhanced standards of conduct for broker-dealers and certain other market participants.  In the European Union (EU), substantial revisions to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) became effective across EU member states beginning January 3, 2018. These revisions introduced expanded requirements for a broad range of investment management activities, including product governance, transparency on costs and charges, independent investment advice, inducements, record keeping and client reporting. In addition, final regulations on European Money Market Fund Reform were published in July 2017 and, following an 18-month transition period for existing funds, will implement new requirements to enhance the liquidity and stability of money market funds in the EU.  Derivatives regulation: The Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its derivatives businesses. The regulations impose capital and margin requirements (including the collecting and posting of variation margin and initial margin in respect of non-centrally cleared derivatives), require central clearing of standardized over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, require that certain standardized over-the-counter swaps be traded on regulated trading venues, and provide for reporting of certain mandated information. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the registration of swap dealers and major swap participants with the CFTC and of security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants with the SEC. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities plc and J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corporation have registered with the CFTC as swap dealers, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc may be required to register with the SEC as security-based swap dealers. As a result of their registration as swap dealers or security-based swap dealers, these entities will be subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to their swap or security-based swap activities, which includes capital requirements, rules regulating their swap activities, rules requiring the collateralization of uncleared swaps, rules regarding segregation of counterparty collateral, business conduct and documentation standards, record-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-fraud and anti-manipulation requirements. Further, some of the rules for derivatives apply extraterritorially to U.S. firms doing business with clients outside of the U.S., as well as to the overseas activities of non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Firm that either deal with U.S. persons or that are guaranteed by U.S. subsidiaries of the Firm ; however, the full scope of the extra-territorial impact of the U.S. swaps regulation has not been finalized and therefore remains unclear. The effect of these rules may require banking entities, such as the Firm , to modify the structure of their derivatives businesses and face increased operational and regulatory costs. In the EU, the implementation of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and MiFID II will result in comparable, but not identical, changes to the European regulatory regime for derivatives. The combined effect of the U.S. and EU requirements, and the potential conflicts and inconsistencies between them, present challenges and risks to the structure and operating model of the Firms derivatives businesses.  The Firm and other financial institutions have agreed to adhere to the 2015 Universal Resolution Stay Protocol (the Protocol) developed by ISDA in response to regulator concerns that the close-out of derivatives and other financial transactions during the resolution of a large cross-border financial institution could impede resolution efforts and potentially destabilize markets. The Protocol provides for the contractual recognition of cross-border stays under ##TABLE_START 6   ##TABLE_ENDvarious statutory resolution regimes and a contractual stay on certain cross-default rights.  In the U.S., one subsidiary of the Firm , J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, is registered as a futures commission merchant, and other subsidiaries are either registered with the CFTC as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors or are exempt from such registration. These CFTC-registered subsidiaries are also members of the National Futures Association.  Data regulation: The Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations concerning the use and protection of certain customer, employee and other personal and confidential information, including those imposed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as well as the EU Data Protection Directive. In addition, various U.S. regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the SEC, have increased their focus on cybersecurity and data privacy through guidance, examinations and regulations. In May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will replace the EU Data Protection Directive, and it will have a significant impact on how businesses can collect and process the personal data of EU individuals. In addition, numerous proposals regarding privacy and data protection are pending before U.S. and non-U.S. legislative and regulatory bodies. The Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions: The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires all financial institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers, to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA includes a variety of record-keeping and reporting requirements (such as cash transaction and suspicious activity reporting), as well as due diligence/know your customer documentation requirements. In January 2013, the Firm entered into Consent Orders with its banking regulators relating to the Firms Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering policies, procedures and controls; the Firm has taken significant steps to modify and enhance its processes and controls with respect to its Anti-Money Laundering procedures and to remediate the issues identified in the Consent Order. The Firm is also subject to the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).  Anti-Corruption: The Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. In November 2016, the Firm entered into a Consent Order with the Federal Reserve to resolve its investigation relating to a former hiring program for candidates referred by clients, potential clients and government officials in the Asia Pacific region. The Firm has taken significant steps to modify and enhance its processes and controls with respect to the hiring of referred candidates and to remediate the issues identified in the Consent Order.  Compensation practices:  The Firms compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as other agencies. The Federal Reserve has issued guidance jointly with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed to ensure that incentive compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the organizations safety and soundness. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve, must issue regulations or guidelines requiring covered financial institutions, including the Firm , to report the structure of all incentive-based compensation arrangements and prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing compensation that is excessive or that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. The Federal Reserve has conducted a review of the incentive compensation policies and practices of a number of large banking institutions, including the Firm. The Financial Stability Board has established standards covering compensation principles for banks. In addition, the SEC has issued regulations that will require public companies to start disclosing, beginning with annual shareholder meetings in 2018, the pay ratio between the companys median employee and the companys chief executive officer or other principal executive officer in the proxy statement as of December 31, 2017. The Firms compensation practices are also subject to regulation and oversight by local regulators in other jurisdictions. In Europe, the Fourth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) includes compensation provisions and the European Banking Authority has instituted guidelines on compensation policies which in certain countries, such as the U.K., are implemented or supplemented by further local regulations or guidelines. The implementation of the Federal Reserves and other banking regulators guidelines regarding compensation are expected to evolve over the next several years, and may affect the manner in which the Firm structures its compensation programs and practices.  Significant international regulatory initiatives: In the EU, there is an extensive and complex program of final and proposed regulatory enhancement that reflects, in part, the EUs commitments to policies of the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (G20) together with other plans specific to the EU. The EU operates a European Systemic Risk Board that monitors financial stability, together with European Supervisory Authorities (ESA) that set detailed regulatory rules and encourage supervisory convergence across the EUs Member States. The EU is currently reviewing the ESA framework. The EU has also created a Single Supervisory Mechanism for the euro-zone, under which the regulation of all banks in that zone will be under the auspices of the European Central Bank, together with a Single Resolution Mechanism and Single Resolution Board, having jurisdiction over bank resolution in the zone. At both the G20 and EU ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I levels, various proposals are under consideration to address risks associated with global financial institutions.   In the EU, this includes EMIR, which requires, among other things, the central clearing of certain standardized derivatives and risk mitigation for uncleared OTC derivatives, and MiFID II, which gives effect to the G20 commitment to move trading of standardized OTC derivatives to exchanges or electronic trading platforms. MiFID II significantly enhances requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency, transaction reporting and investor protection. MiFID II also introduces a commodities position limits and reporting regime. EMIR became effective in 2012, although some requirements apply on a phased basis and certain aspects of the regulation are currently being reviewed. MiFID II became effective across EU Member States on January 3, 2018, after a one-year delay. The EU is also currently considering or implementing significant revisions to laws covering securities settlement; mutual funds and pensions; payments; anti-money laundering controls; data security and privacy; transparency and disclosure of securities financing transactions; benchmarks; resolution of banks, investment firms and market infrastructures; and capital and liquidity requirements for banks and investment firms. The capital and liquidity legislation for banks and investment firms will implement in the EU many of the finalized Basel III capital and liquidity standards, including in relation to the leverage ratio, market risk capital, and a net stable funding ratio. The legislation also proposes an intermediate parent undertaking (IPU) requirement for foreign banks, which will require non-EU banks operating in Europe (with total EU assets greater than EUR30 billion or which are part of a GSIB) to establish a single EU-located IPU. The full impact of the proposal on JPMs EU operations and legal entities will be heavily influenced by the outcome of the EU legislative process, including whether any flexibility is introduced to the requirement.  Consistent with the G20 and EU policy frameworks, U.K. regulators have adopted a range of policy measures that have significantly changed the markets and prudential regulatory environment in the U.K. In addition, U.K. regulators have introduced measures to enhance accountability of individuals, and promote forward-looking conduct risk identification and mitigation, including by introducing the Senior Managers and Certification Regimes. On June 23, 2016, the U.K. voted by referendum to leave the European Union. The U.K. government invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on March 29, 2017, starting a two-year period for the formal exit negotiations. This means that the U.K. will leave the EU on March 29, 2019 unless the timeline is unanimously extended by the remaining 27 EU Member States (EU27) and the U.K. In December 2017, the EU27 agreed that sufficient progress had been made on the terms of the U.K.s withdrawal to allow parallel talks on the future relationship, which are expected to begin in March 2018. The U.K.s priorities in negotiating the future relationship are to seek a bilateral free trade agreement with the EU27 that facilitates the greatest possible access to the Single Market. However, the U.K. will not seek to continue its membership in the Single Market. The current EU27 position is that a free trade agreement should be balanced, ambitious and wide-ranging, that the U.K.s participation in the Single Market or parts thereof must end, and that there will not be any sector-specific carve-outs, such as for financial services. Both the EU27 and the U.K. are open to the idea of a transitional arrangement.  The U.K.s departure from the EU will have a significant impact across the Firms European businesses, including business and legal entity reorganization, and may lead to direct and indirect changes to EU27 and U.K. regulatory approaches. The situation remains highly uncertain, particularly in relation to whether a transition period is implemented and whether financial services will be included in any future free trade agreement.  ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Regulatory JPMorgan Chases businesses are highly regulated, and the laws and regulations that apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its operations. JPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business. The regulation of financial services activities is typically extensive and comprehensive. In recent years, legislators and regulators adopted a wide range of new laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry, both within and outside the U.S. The supervision of financial services firms also expanded significantly during this period. The wave of increased regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase has affected the way that it conducts and structures its operations. Existing and new laws and regulations and expanded supervision could require JPMorgan Chase to make further changes to its operations. These changes could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs for complying with laws and regulations or losing a significant amount of revenue, and could reduce JPMorgan Chases profitability. More specifically, existing and new laws and regulations could require JPMorgan Chase to: ##TABLE_START  limit the products and services that it offers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  stop or discourage it from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  recognize losses in the value of assets that it holds ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 8   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pay higher assessments, levies or other governmental charges ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  impose restrictions on certain business activities, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increase the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them. ##TABLE_END Differences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for JPMorgan Chases business. The content and application of laws and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, or other criteria. For example: ##TABLE_START  larger firms are often subject to more stringent supervision and regulation ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  financial technology companies and other competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that country. ##TABLE_END There can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in different countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, legislative and regulatory initiatives within the EU could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in that region in order to comply with those requirements. These include laws and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to: ##TABLE_START  the resolution of financial institutions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the establishment by non-EU financial institutions of intermediate holding companies in the EU ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the separation of trading activities from core banking services ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  mandatory on-exchange trading ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  position limits and reporting rules for derivatives ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  governance and accountability regimes ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  conduct of business requirements, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  restrictions on compensation. ##TABLE_END These types of differences in financial services regulation, or inconsistencies or conflicts between laws and regulations between different jurisdictions, could require JPMorgan Chase to, among other things: ##TABLE_START  divest assets or restructure its operations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  absorb increased operational, capital and liquidity costs ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  change the prices that it charges for its products and services ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks. ##TABLE_END Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chases ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chases businesses, results of operations and profitability. Governments in some countries in which JPMorgan Chase does business have adopted laws or regulations which require that JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries which operate in those countries maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity on a stand-alone basis. Some regulators outside the U.S. have also proposed that large banks which conduct certain businesses in their jurisdictions operate through separate subsidiaries located in those countries. These requirements, and any future laws or regulations that impose restrictions on the way JPMorgan Chase organizes its businesses or increase the capital or liquidity requirements that would apply to JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries, could hinder JPMorgan Chases ability to efficiently manage its operations, increase its funding and liquidity costs, and result in lower profitability. Heightened regulatory scrutiny of JPMorgan Chases businesses has increased its compliance costs and could result in restrictions on its operations. JPMorgan Chases operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions where JPMorgan Chase does business. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines or provided other monetary relief in connection with resolving several investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar regulatory settlements or other actions in the future, and addressing the requirements of any such settlement could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs. In connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the settlement. These types of admissions can lead to: ##TABLE_START  greater exposure in civil litigation ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  damage to reputation ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I ##TABLE_START  other direct and indirect adverse effects. ##TABLE_END Furthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have increasingly demanded that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. In the case of JPMorgan Chase, these resolutions have included: ##TABLE_START  JPMorgan Chases agreement in May 2015 to plead guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law in connection with its settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the non-prosecution agreement entered into by a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase with the U.S. Department of Justice in November 2016 in connection with settlements to resolve various governmental investigations relating to a former hiring program for candidates referred by clients, potential clients and government officials in the Asia Pacific region. ##TABLE_END Resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution, including loss of clients, customers and business, the inability to offer certain products or services, or losing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or permanently. JPMorgan Chase expects that it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to expanded regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions. JPMorgan Chase also expects that regulators will continue to insist that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions. Furthermore, if JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any governmental settlements and other actions to which it is subject, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators, it could be required to, among other things: ##TABLE_START  enter into further orders and settlements ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pay additional regulatory fines, penalties or judgments, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of, its businesses. ##TABLE_END The extent of JPMorgan Chases exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established for those matters. Requirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses. JPMorgan Chase is required under the Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy without extraordinary government support, in the event of material financial distress or failure. The agencies evaluation of the Firms resolution plan may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase making changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities that could increase funding or operational costs. If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were to determine that a future resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on JPMorgan Chases growth, activities or operations. After two years, if the deficiencies are not cured, the agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases operations and strategy.  Holders of JPMorgan Chase  Co.s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution. Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase  Co. (the holding company) maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity with specific terms (eligible LTD) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chases operating subsidiaries if the holding company were to enter into a resolution either: ##TABLE_START  in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (Title II). ##TABLE_END If the holding company were to enter into a resolution, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the holding company will absorb the losses of the holding company and its affiliates. The preferred single point of entry strategy under JPMorgan Chases resolution plan contemplates that only the holding company would enter bankruptcy proceedings. JPMorgan Chases subsidiaries would be recapitalized as needed so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the holding companys losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the holding companys equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chases subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the holding company. Accordingly, in a resolution of the holding company in bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the holding company would realize value only to the ##TABLE_START 10   ##TABLE_ENDextent available to the holding company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the holding company have been fully repaid. The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the holding company, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not, to date, formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy. If the holding company were to enter into a resolution, none of the holding company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chases preferred strategy, and losses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the holding company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater. Political Political developments can cause uncertainty concerning the regulatory environment in which JPMorgan Chase operates its businesses. Recent elections and referendums in the U.S. and abroad have introduced uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment in which JPMorgan Chase and other financial services firms will operate in the future. For example, the U.K.s planned departure from the EU has engendered significant uncertainty concerning the regulatory framework under which global financial services institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, will need to conduct their business in the U.K. and the EU. Depending on the nature of the arrangements agreed between the U.K. and the EU, including with respect to the ability of financial services companies to engage in business in the EU from legal entities organized in or operating from the U.K., JPMorgan Chase may need to make significant changes to its legal entity structure and operations and the locations in which it operates. These types of structural and operational changes could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to implement an operating model across its European legal entities that is less efficient or cost-effective. The result of an election may suggest that the new administration will ease the regulatory requirements that apply to financial services firms. However, it is equally possible that the potential for reduced regulation does not occur or is reversed by another regulator or by a subsequent administration, or that deregulation measures that are ultimately enacted deliver significant competitive advantages to financial services firms that are structured differently or serve different markets than JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase cannot predict political developments of this nature, or whether they will have favorable or unfavorable long-term effects on its businesses. Economic uncertainty caused by political developments can hurt JPMorgan Chases businesses. The economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates continue to be uncertain due to recent political developments in the U.S. and abroad. Certain policy proposals, including isolationist foreign policies, protectionist trade policies or the possible withdrawal or reduction of government support for GSEs, could cause a contraction in U.S. and global economic growth and higher volatility in the financial markets. These types of political developments could, among other things: ##TABLE_START  erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  heighten concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency. ##TABLE_END These factors could lead to greater market volatility, large-scale sales of U.S. government debt and other U.S. debt and equity securities, the widening of credit spreads and other market dislocations. Any of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses in its investment securities portfolio, reduce its capital levels, hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers, and weaken its results of operations. Political developments in other parts of the world have also led to uncertainty in global economic conditions, including: ##TABLE_START  concerns about the capabilities and intentions of the government of North Korea, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regional hostilities, and political or social upheavals, in other parts of the world. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chases results of operations can be adversely affected by the uncertainty arising from significant political developments and any market volatility or disruption that results from that uncertainty. The positive impact of U.S. tax reform legislation on JPMorgan Chase may diminish over time. The long-term impact of the tax reform legislation recently enacted in the U.S. on JPMorgan Chase and the U.S. economy is not yet known. While the tax reform will have a positive impact on JPMorgan Chases net income, the competitive environment and other factors will influence the extent to which these benefits are retained by JPMorgan Chase over the longer term. In addition, the specific impact on JPMorgan Chases businesses, products and geographies may vary. Market JPMorgan Chases businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions. JPMorgan Chases results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following: ##TABLE_START  the liquidity in the U.S. and global financial markets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the level and volatility of market prices and rates, including those for debt and equity instruments, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I currencies, commodities, interest rates and other market indices ##TABLE_START  investor, consumer and business sentiment ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  events that reduce confidence in the financial markets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inflation and unemployment ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the availability and cost of capital and credit ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the economic effects of natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health emergencies or pandemics, cyberattacks, outbreaks of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  monetary and fiscal policies and actions taken by governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve and other central banks, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the health of the U.S. and global economies. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. domestic economic conditions, including: ##TABLE_START  U.S. interest rates ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the rate of unemployment ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  housing prices ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the level of consumer confidence ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in consumer spending, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the number of personal bankruptcies. ##TABLE_END Sustained low growth in the U.S. economy could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses. It could also increase the cost to provide those products and services. Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies in mortgage, credit card, auto and other loans and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chases earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies where high levels of unemployment have resulted from declining industrial or manufacturing activity. JPMorgan Chases earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by changes in government policies that affect consumers, including those relating to medical insurance, immigration and employment status, as well as governmental policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as infrastructure spending and global trade, which could result in, among other things, higher inflation or reductions in consumer disposable income. In JPMorgan Chases wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings. Furthermore, if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chases capital markets businesses could be reduced to the extent that those businesses: ##TABLE_START  earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  dispose of portions of credit commitments, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings, at a loss, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chases investment securities portfolio and market-making positions can suffer losses due to adverse economic, market and political events and conditions. JPMorgan Chase generally maintains positions in various fixed income instruments in its investment securities portfolio, and positions in various fixed income, currency, commodity, credit and equity instruments as part of its market-making activities. Market-making positions are intended to facilitate demand from JPMorgan Chases clients for these instruments and to provide liquidity for clients. The value of the positions that JPMorgan Chase holds can be significantly affected by factors such as: ##TABLE_START  JPMorgan Chases ability to effectively hedge market and other risks on its positions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  volatility in interest rates and debt, equity and commodities markets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in interest rates and credit spreads, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the availability of liquidity in the capital markets. ##TABLE_END All of these are affected by global economic, market and political events and conditions, as well as regulatory restrictions on market-making activities. JPMorgan Chases investment securities portfolio and market-making businesses can also suffer losses due to unanticipated market events, including: ##TABLE_START  severe declines in asset values ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unexpected credit events ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa), or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument. ##TABLE_END If JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its investment securities portfolio or from market-making activities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chases profitability and its capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses. ##TABLE_START 12   ##TABLE_ENDJPMorgan Chases asset and wealth management and custody businesses may earn lower fee revenue during adverse macroeconomic conditions. The fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing third-party assets or holding assets in custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of the client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or holds in custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan Chases revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance. Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of JPMorgan Chases revenue and income streams. JPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income when interest rates are high or increasing. However, higher interest rates can also lead to: ##TABLE_START  fewer originations of commercial and residential loans ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  lower returns on JPMorgan Chases investment securities portfolio, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the loss of deposits to the extent that JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior. ##TABLE_END All of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chases revenues and capital levels. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chases consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans. On the other hand, a low interest rate environment may cause JPMorgan Chases net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce: ##TABLE_START  the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the value of JPMorgan Chases mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) asset, thereby reducing its net interest income and other revenues. ##TABLE_END When credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chases credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chases credit spreads will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chases earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value. High market volatility can impact JPMorgan Chases markets businesses. While JPMorgan Chases markets businesses may earn higher flow revenue during periods of elevated market volatility, sudden and significant volatility in the prices of securities, loans, derivatives and other instruments can: ##TABLE_START  curtail the trading markets for those instruments ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  make it difficult to sell or hedge those instruments ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increase JPMorgan Chases funding costs, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  adversely affect JPMorgan Chases profitability, capital or liquidity. ##TABLE_END The Federal Reserve has observed that market volatility may be exacerbated by regulatory restrictions. It noted that market participants that are subject to the Volcker Rule are likely to decrease their market-making activities, and thereby constrain market liquidity, during periods of market stress. Furthermore, market participants that are not required to hold substantial amounts of capital may retreat more quickly from volatile markets, which could further reduce market liquidity. In a difficult or less liquid market environment, JPMorgan Chases risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies. In these circumstances, it may be difficult for JPMorgan Chase to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations. Sustained volatility in the financial markets may also negatively affect consumer or investor confidence, which could lead to lower client activity and reduce JPMorgan Chases revenues. Credit JPMorgan Chase can be adversely affected by the financial condition of its clients, customers and counterparties. JPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, investment managers and other types of financial institutions. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation in the event that a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I provide custody services for assets of JPMorgan Chases clients becomes insolvent. Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can also impair JPMorgan Chases ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities. JPMorgan Chases markets businesses can be harmed by the insolvency of a significant market participant. The failure of a significant market participant, or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a firm, can have a cascading effect within the financial markets. JPMorgan Chases markets businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting. JPMorgan Chases clearing services business is exposed to the risk of client or counterparty default. As part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is a member of various central counterparty clearinghouses (CCPs). In the event that another member of such an organization defaults on its obligations to the CCP, JPMorgan Chase may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the CCP as a result of that default. As a clearing member, JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase is exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the clients bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events can increase JPMorgan Chases operational and litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses. JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions. During periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan Chases credit risk may be further increased when JPMorgan Chase cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to it. Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral. JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk. JPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties: ##TABLE_START  engage in similar businesses ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  do business in the same geographic region, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  have business profiles, models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. ##TABLE_END For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of JPMorgan Chases borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chases credit and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value losses in its trading businesses. Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chases borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those risks may not be successful. JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive, industry-wide expansion of consumer credit. For example, heightened competition among financial institutions for certain types of consumer loans, including credit card, mortgage, auto or other loans, could prompt significant reductions in the pricing of those loans and thereby decrease their profitability, or result in loans being extended to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment. Disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets could cause JPMorgan Chase to be unable to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions in various debt instruments, loans, derivatives and other obligations, and thereby lead to increased risk concentrations. If JPMorgan ##TABLE_START 14   ##TABLE_ENDChase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of risk-weighted assets (RWA) that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could increase JPMorgan Chases capital requirements and funding costs and adversely affect the profitability of JPMorgan Chases businesses. Liquidity Liquidity is critical to JPMorgan Chases ability to fund and operate its businesses. JPMorgan Chases liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as: ##TABLE_START  market-wide illiquidity or disruption ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unforeseen cash or capital requirements ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  default by a CCP or other significant market participant ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial institutions in general. ##TABLE_END A diminution of JPMorgan Chases liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control. For example, during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, periods of low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity resulted in higher funding costs for JPMorgan Chase and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity, including securitized debt issuances. There is no assurance that severe conditions of this type will not occur in the future. JPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as bank deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan Chases funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order to: ##TABLE_START  satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  continue to satisfy requirements under the TLAC rules concerning the amount of eligible LTD that JPMorgan Chase must have outstanding ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  address obligations under its resolution plan, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  satisfy regulatory requirements in countries outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities. ##TABLE_END More generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses, and thereby adversely affect its results of operations. JPMorgan Chase  Co. is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities. JPMorgan Chase  Co. is a holding company that holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the IHC). The IHC in turn holds the stock of substantially all of JPMorgan Chases subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and intercompany indebtedness owing to the holding company. The holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to make payments to the holding company is also limited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chases management or Board of Directors. As a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. These limitations could affect the holding companys ability to: ##TABLE_START  pay interest on its debt securities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pay dividends on its equity securities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  fulfill its other payment obligations. ##TABLE_END Collectively, these regulatory restrictions and limitations could significantly limit the holding companys ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations. They could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of those thresholds. Reductions in JPMorgan Chases credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding. JPMorgan Chase  Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate both general and firm- and industry-specific factors when determining their credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including: ##TABLE_START  economic and geopolitical trends ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regulatory developments ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expected future profitability ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I ##TABLE_START  risk management practices ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  legal expenses ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  assumptions about government support, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings. However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan Chases credit ratings will not be lowered in the future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chases options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low. A reduction in JPMorgan Chases credit ratings could curtail JPMorgan Chases business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including by: ##TABLE_START  reducing access to capital markets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  materially increasing the cost of issuing and servicing securities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  triggering additional collateral or funding requirements, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorgan Chase. ##TABLE_END Any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase  Co. and its subsidiaries. This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase  Co. and its subsidiaries. Regulation and reform of benchmarks could have adverse consequences on securities and other instruments that are linked to those benchmarks. Interest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be benchmarks are the subject of recent international, national and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented. These reforms may cause benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated. Any of the international, national or other proposals for reform or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks could also increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of benchmarks and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain benchmarks or lead to the disappearance of certain benchmarks. On July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA), which regulates the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021, and it appears likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by 2021. Any of the these developments, and any future initiatives to regulate, reform or change the manner of administration of benchmarks, could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of and market for securities and other instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark, including those issued by JPMorgan Chase or its subsidiaries. Operational JPMorgan Chases businesses are highly dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants. JPMorgan Chases businesses rely comprehensively on the ability of JPMorgan Chases financial, accounting, trading, data processing and other operational systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately and quickly. In addition to proper design, installation, maintenance and training, the effective functioning of JPMorgan Chases operational systems depends on, among other things: ##TABLE_START  the quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality of a particular operational system and other systems to which it transmits information, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  JPMorgan Chases ability to appropriately maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are managed carefully to ensure operational continuity. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of its vendors, custodians and other market participants, including clearing and payment systems, CCPs, securities exchanges and data processing, security and technology companies. The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of the operational systems of JPMorgan Chase or another significant market participant, including due to a cyberbreach, could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including: ##TABLE_START  delays or other disruptions in providing information, services and liquidity to clients and customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other assets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 16   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the possibility that transactions such as funds transfers or capital markets trades are executed erroneously, illegally or with unintended consequences ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  financial losses, including possible restitution to clients and customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  higher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that is unavailable ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  customer dissatisfaction and loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chases products and services, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  harm to reputation. ##TABLE_END Furthermore, the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, CCPs, payment processors, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures, and the increased importance of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially affect JPMorgan Chases ability to conduct business. As the speed, frequency, volume and complexity of transactions increases, it becomes more challenging to effectively maintain JPMorgan Chases operational systems and infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that: ##TABLE_START  errors, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause widespread system disruption ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound, or migrate to other systems over time, to become larger issues ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  failures in synchronization or encryption software, or degraded performance of microprocessors due to design flaws, causes disruptions in operational systems, or the inability of systems to communicate with each other, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  third parties attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights. ##TABLE_END If JPMorgan Chases operational systems, or those of third parties on which JPMorgan Chases businesses depend, are unable to meet the demanding standards of JPMorgan Chases businesses and operations, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected. JPMorgan Chase relies on the skill and integrity of its employees and those of third parties in running its operational systems. The effective functioning of JPMorgan Chases operational systems also depends on the competence and reliability of its employees, as well as the employees of third parties on whom JPMorgan Chase depends for technological support, security or other services. JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected by a significant operational breakdown or failure caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or a third party. JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with new products or processes. When JPMorgan Chase changes processes or introduces new products and services or new connectivity solutions, JPMorgan Chase may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with new business activities. Any of these occurrences could diminish JPMorgan Chases ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in: ##TABLE_START  potential liability to clients and customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increased operating expenses ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  damage to JPMorgan Chases reputation ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  impairment of JPMorgan Chases liquidity ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regulatory intervention, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  weaker competitive standing. ##TABLE_END Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases businesses and results of operations. JPMorgan Chases connections to third-party operational systems expose it to greater operational risks. Third parties with which JPMorgan Chase does business, as well as retailers, data aggregators and other third parties with which JPMorgan Chases customers do business, can also be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. This is particularly the case where activities of customers or those third parties are beyond JPMorgan Chases security and control systems, including through the use of the internet, personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services. If a third party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorgan Chases systems, and that third party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its customers, including: ##TABLE_START  heightened risk that third parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chases systems ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws and regulations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the third partys security breach, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  harm to reputation arising from the perception that JPMorgan Chases systems may not be secure. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I As JPMorgan Chases interconnectivity with customers and other third parties expands, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to their systems. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chases customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting those other third parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information. These actions can increase JPMorgan Chases operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction. JPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information. JPMorgan Chases businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. The protected parties can include: ##TABLE_START  JPMorgan Chases clients and customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  clients and customers of JPMorgan Chases clients and customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  JPMorgan Chases employees, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  employees of JPMorgan Chases suppliers, counterparties and other third parties. ##TABLE_END Ensuring that JPMorgan Chases collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can: ##TABLE_START  increase JPMorgan Chases operating costs ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  affect the development of new products or services ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chases management, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  require JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. ##TABLE_END Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase cannot ensure that all of its clients and customers, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if personal, confidential or proprietary information of clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused, such as situations where such information is: ##TABLE_START  erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties. ##TABLE_END Concerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chases measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chases revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan Chases reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses. JPMorgan Chases operations and results could be vulnerable to catastrophes or other events that disrupt its business. JPMorgan Chases business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted by events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, including: ##TABLE_START  cyberbreaches or breaches of physical premises ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  electrical or telecommunications outages ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  failures of, or loss of access to, operational systems, including computer systems, servers, networks and other technology assets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  damage to or loss of property or assets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  natural disasters or severe weather conditions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  health emergencies or pandemics, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure the ability to recover critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chases resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers. Any significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chases operations or operational systems could, among other things: ##TABLE_START  hinder its ability to provide services to its clients and customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  cause it to incur financial losses, both from loss of revenue and damage to or loss of property, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. ##TABLE_END A successful cyberattack against JPMorgan Chase could cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase experiences numerous cyberattacks on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets on a daily basis. These cyberattacks can ##TABLE_START 18   ##TABLE_ENDtake many forms, but a common objective of many of these attacks is to introduce computer viruses or malware into JPMorgan Chases systems. These viruses or malicious code are typically designed to, among other things: ##TABLE_START  obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  manipulate or destroy data ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan Chases systems, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  steal money. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase has also been the target of significant distributed denial-of-service attacks which are intended to disrupt online banking services. JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems to protect them against cyberattacks. However, JPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to cyberattacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers. A principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide absolute security against cyberattacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chases systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches. This is because, among other things: ##TABLE_START  the techniques used in cyberattacks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  third parties may seek to gain access to JPMorgan Chases systems either directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of JPMorgan Chases systems. ##TABLE_END The risk of a security breach due to a cyberattack could increase in the future as JPMorgan Chase continues to expand its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of JPMorgan Chases systems or the systems of a supplier, governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences, including: ##TABLE_START  significant disruption of JPMorgan Chases operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational systems ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  misappropriation of confidential information of JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers, counterparties or employees ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  damage to computers or systems of JPMorgan Chase and those of its clients, customers and counterparties ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inability to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other laws ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients and customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chases cybersecurity measures ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  client and customer dissatisfaction ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  harm to JPMorgan Chases reputation. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase could also suffer some of the above consequences if a third party were to misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan Chases employees. JPMorgan Chase may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a security breach due to a cyberattack. A successful breach of JPMorgan Chases computer systems, software, networks or other technology assets due to a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected due to, among other things: ##TABLE_START  the breadth of JPMorgan Chases operations and the high volume of transactions that it processes ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the large number of customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which JPMorgan Chase does business ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the proliferation and increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the possibility that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems. ##TABLE_END The extent of a particular cyberattack and the steps that JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. While such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, any or all of which could ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack. JPMorgan Chases risk management framework and procedures may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chases risk management framework is intended to mitigate risk and loss. JPMorgan Chase has established processes and procedures to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which JPMorgan Chase is subject. However, there are inherent limitations to risk management strategies because there may be existing or future risks that JPMorgan Chase has not appropriately anticipated or identified. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to unexpected losses, and JPMorgan Chases financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, by any inadequacy or lapse in its risk management framework, governance structure, procedures and practices, models or reporting systems. An inadequacy or lapse could: ##TABLE_START  require significant resources to remediate ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  attract heightened regulatory scrutiny ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expose JPMorgan Chase to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  subject it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  harm its reputation, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of JPMorgan Chases data gathering and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting. JPMorgan Chase establishes allowances for probable credit losses that are inherent in its credit exposures. It then employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to JPMorgan Chases results of operations and financial condition. They require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of JPMorgan Chases borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. It is possible that JPMorgan Chase will fail to identify the proper factors or that it will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies. Many of JPMorgan Chases risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior. These strategies and techniques are based to some degree on managements subjective judgment. For example, many models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated. Conversely, previously-correlated indicators may make unrelated movements at those times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have, in some circumstances, limited the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chases risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses. JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses and face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models or estimations are inadequate. JPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations to assess and implement mitigating controls over its market, credit, operational and other risks. These models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective in all cases to observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as: ##TABLE_START  reliance on historical trends that may not accurately predict future events, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations which predict correlation among certain market indicators or asset prices ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  historical trend information may be incomplete, or may not anticipate severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  models and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase could incur substantial losses, its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models or estimations prove to be inadequate. Some of the models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorgan Chases regulators. These reviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and estimations in connection with calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan Chases models or estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses. JPMorgan Chases capital actions could also be constrained if a CCAR submission is not approved by its banking regulators due to the perceived inadequacy of its models or estimations. ##TABLE_START 20   ##TABLE_ENDEnhanced standards for vendor risk management can result in higher costs and other potential exposures. JPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with doing business with vendors and other third-party service providers. These requirements are contained both in bank regulatory regulations and guidance and in certain consent orders to which JPMorgan Chase has been subject. JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships. JPMorgan Chases failure to appropriately assess and manage third-party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could materially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could subject JPMorgan Chase to: ##TABLE_START  potential liability to clients and customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increased operational costs, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  harm to its reputation. ##TABLE_END Requirements for physical settlement and delivery in trading agreements could expose JPMorgan Chase to operational and other risks. Certain of JPMorgan Chases markets transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that JPMorgan Chase does not own. If JPMorgan Chase is unable to obtain the obligations within the required timeframe, JPMorgan Chase could forfeit payments otherwise due. Failures could also result in settlement delays, which could damage JPMorgan Chases reputation and ability to transact business. Failure to timely settle and confirm transactions could also subject JPMorgan Chase to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, market and operational losses. JPMorgan Chase could incur unexpected losses if estimates and judgments underlying its financial statements are incorrect. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), JPMorgan Chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation, among other items. Certain financial instruments require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare JPMorgan Chases financial statements, including: ##TABLE_START  trading assets and liabilities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  instruments in the investment securities portfolio ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  certain loans ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  MSRs ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  structured notes, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  certain repurchase and resale agreements. ##TABLE_END Where quoted market prices are not available for these types of instruments, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. Sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which could lead to valuations being subsequently changed or adjusted. If estimates or judgments underlying JPMorgan Chases financial statements prove to have been incorrect, JPMorgan Chase may experience material losses. Lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chases profitability or reputation. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chases disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could: ##TABLE_START  materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases business and results of operations or financial condition ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  restrict its ability to access the capital markets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  require it to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  harm its reputation, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  otherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan Chase. ##TABLE_END Strategic If JPMorgan Chases management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies, JPMorgan Chases competitive standing and results could suffer.  JPMorgan Chases business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and results of operations. These strategies relate to: ##TABLE_START  the products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the geographies in which it operates ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the types of clients and customers that it serves ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the counterparties with which it does business, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services. ##TABLE_END The franchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan Chases businesses, and its earnings and results of operations, may suffer and revenues could decline if management makes choices about these strategies and goals that: ##TABLE_START  prove to be incorrect ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I ##TABLE_START  do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  fail to address changing regulatory and market environments in the U.S. and abroad. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chases growth and prospects also depend on managements ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in the near term and over longer time horizons. Managements effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chases ability to develop and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to shareholders. Each of these objectives could be adversely affected by managements failure to: ##TABLE_START  devise effective business plans and strategies ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  effectively implement business decisions, including by minimizing bureaucratic processes ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  institute controls that appropriately address the risks associated with business activities and any changes in those activities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  offer products and services that meet the expectations of clients and customers, and in ways that enhance their satisfaction with those products and services ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  allocate capital to JPMorgan Chases businesses in a manner that promotes their long-term profitability ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  adequately respond to regulatory requirements ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  appropriately address shareholder concerns ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  develop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage JPMorgan Chases businesses. ##TABLE_END Additionally, JPMorgan Chases Board of Directors plays an important role in exercising appropriate oversight of managements strategic decisions, and a failure by the Board to perform this function could also impair JPMorgan Chases results of operations. Conduct Misconduct by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm its clients and customers, damage its reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action. JPMorgan Chases employees interact with clients, customers and counterparties, and with each other, every day. All employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the culture and behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan Chases How We Do Business Principles, including JPMorgan Chases commitment to do first class business in a first class way. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed culture and conduct risk management throughout an employees life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance management. Culture and conduct risk management are also important to JPMorgan Chases promotion and compensation processes. Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, certain employees have in the past engaged in improper or illegal conduct resulting in litigation as well as settlements involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements and non-prosecution agreements, as well as other civil and criminal settlements with regulators and other governmental entities. There is no assurance that further inappropriate actions by employees will not occur or that any such actions will always be deterred or quickly prevented. JPMorgan Chases reputation could be harmed, and collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one or more employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chases expectations, including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, other market participants or other employees. Some examples of this include: ##TABLE_START  improperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chases products or services ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorized trading ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  facilitating illegal or aggressive tax-motivated transactions, or transactions designed to circumvent economic sanction programs ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  violating anti-trust or anti-competition laws by colluding with other market participants to manipulate markets, prices or indices ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  making risk decisions in ways that subordinate JPMorgan Chases risk appetite to employee compensation objectives, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  misappropriating property or confidential or proprietary information or technology belonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third parties. ##TABLE_END The consequences of any failure by employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chases expectations could include litigation, or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, or lead to: ##TABLE_START  financial losses ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increased operational and compliance costs ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  greater regulatory scrutiny ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  requirements that JPMorgan Chase restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chases management ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the undermining of JPMorgan Chases culture ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 22   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  loss of clients or customers, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  harm to JPMorgan Chases reputation. ##TABLE_END Reputation Damage to JPMorgan Chases reputation could harm its businesses. Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chases reputation can therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chases business and prospects. Harm to JPMorgan Chases reputation can arise from numerous sources, including: ##TABLE_START  employee misconduct ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  security breaches ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance failures ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regulatory investigations, enforcement actions or settlements. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chases reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of certain third parties to comply with laws or regulations, including companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors and other third parties with which JPMorgan Chase does business. JPMorgan Chases reputation or prospects may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet, and this risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chases reputation. For example, concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution, or that a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers, can damage the reputation of the industry as a whole. If JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors, the measures needed to address the associated reputational issues could increase JPMorgan Chases operational and compliance costs and negatively affect its earnings. Furthermore, events that undermine JPMorgan Chases reputation can hinder its ability to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and employees. Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest can result in litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage JPMorgan Chases reputation. JPMorgan Chases ability to manage potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as its business activities encompass more transactions, obligations and interests with and among JPMorgan Chases clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions, and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to, among other things: ##TABLE_START  adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  deliver appropriate standards of service and quality ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  treat clients and customers fairly ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  use client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations. ##TABLE_END In the future, a failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chases reputation. Country JPMorgan Chase can incur losses due to unfavorable economic developments around the world. JPMorgan Chases businesses and earnings are affected by the monetary, fiscal and other policies adopted by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities and agencies. For example, the Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the U.S. and the return earned on those loans and investments. Changes in fiscal policies by central banks or regulatory authorities, and the manner in which those policies are executed, are beyond JPMorgan Chases control and may be difficult to predict. Consequently, unanticipated changes in these policies or the ways in which they are implemented could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chases businesses and results of operations. JPMorgan Chases businesses and revenues are also subject to the risks inherent in investing and market-making in securities, loans and other obligations of companies worldwide. These risks include, among others: ##TABLE_START  negative effects from slowing growth rates or recessionary economic conditions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, in the countries or regions in which those companies operate, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the other risks and considerations discussed below. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I Adverse economic and political developments in a country or region can have a wider negative impact on JPMorgan Chases businesses. Some countries or regions in which JPMorgan Chase operates or invests, or in which JPMorgan Chase may do business in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. In some cases, concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries can cause a contraction of available credit and reduced commercial activity among trading partners within the affected countries or region. These developments can also create market volatility which can lead to a contagion affecting other countries in the same region or beyond. Furthermore, governments in particular countries or regions in which JPMorgan Chase or its clients do business may choose to adopt protectionist economic or trade policies in response to concerns about domestic economic conditions. Any or all of these developments could lead to diminished cross-border trade and financing activity within that country or region, all of which could negatively affect JPMorgan Chases business and earnings in those jurisdictions. If JPMorgan Chase takes steps to reduce its market and credit risk exposure within a particular country or region that is experiencing economic or political disruption, it may incur losses that are higher than expected because it will be disposing of assets when market conditions are likely to be highly unfavorable. JPMorgan Chases business activities with governmental entities pose a greater risk of loss. Several of JPMorgan Chases businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, both within and outside the U.S. These activities can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputation risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may: ##TABLE_START  default on or restructure its obligations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government. ##TABLE_END Any or all of these actions could adversely affect JPMorgan Chases financial condition and results of operations and could hurt its reputation, particularly if JPMorgan Chase pursues claims against a government obligor in a jurisdiction in which it has significant business relationships with clients or customers. JPMorgan Chases business and revenues in emerging markets can be hampered by local political, social and economic factors. Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the U.S. and other developed markets in which JPMorgan Chase operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including: ##TABLE_START  extreme currency fluctuations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  high inflation ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  low or negative growth, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt. ##TABLE_END The governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment. In addition, these countries, as well as certain more developed countries, have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions and related governmental actions, including: ##TABLE_START  social unrest ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  general strikes and demonstrations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  crime and corruption ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  security and personal safety issues ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  outbreaks of hostilities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  overthrow of incumbent governments ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  terrorist attacks, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other forms of internal discord. ##TABLE_END These economic, political and social developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future could lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan Chases operations in those countries and impair the revenues, growth and profitability of those operations. If the legal and regulatory system in a particular country is less established or predictable, this can create a more difficult environment in which to conduct business. For example, any of the following could hamper JPMorgan Chases operations and reduce its earnings in countries with less established or predictable legal and regulatory regimes: ##TABLE_START  the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the adoption of conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  uncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual obligations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 24   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions, the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chases operations in or involving emerging markets countries can also be affected by governmental actions such as: ##TABLE_START  monetary policies ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expropriation, nationalization or confiscation of assets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  price, capital or exchange controls, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in laws and regulations. ##TABLE_END The impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than more-developed markets. These types of government actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chases operations in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multi-national clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction. For example, some or all of these governmental actions can result in funds belonging to JPMorgan Chase, or that it places with a local custodian on behalf of a client, being effectively trapped in a country. In addition to the ultimate risk of losing the funds entirely, JPMorgan Chase could be exposed for an extended period of time to the credit risk of a local custodian that is now operating in a deteriorating domestic economy. JPMorgan Chases revenues from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other obligations can be negatively affected by the foregoing economic, political and social conditions in a particular country in which it does business. In addition, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan Chases operations and investments in another country or countries, including in the U.S. JPMorgan Chases operations in the emerging markets can subject it to higher operational and compliance costs. Conducting business in countries with less-developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires JPMorgan Chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems or that JPMorgan Chase will be able to develop effective working relationships with local regulators. Complying with economic sanctions and anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations can increase JPMorgan Chases operational and compliance costs and risks. JPMorgan Chase must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by OFAC and similar national and multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S., as well as anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations throughout the world. JPMorgan Chase can incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating its businesses to comply with these requirements. Furthermore, a violation of a sanction or embargo program or anti-corruption or anti-money laundering laws and regulations could subject JPMorgan Chase, and individual employees, to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties. Competition The financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chases results of operations will suffer if it is not a strong and effective competitor. JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment, and expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors include: ##TABLE_START  other banks and financial institutions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  trading, advisory and investment management firms ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  finance companies and technology companies, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations. New competitors have emerged. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, payment processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payment processing and other services could be disrupted by technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. Ongoing or increased competition may put downward pressure on prices and fees for JPMorgan Chases products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share. This competition may be on the basis of, among other factors, quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chases businesses to ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions or underperformance, could affect JPMorgan Chases ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chases revenues. Increased competition also may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive. Non-U.S. competitors of JPMorgan Chases wholesale businesses outside the U.S. are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. The more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial services institutions can put JPMorgan Chase and those firms at a competitive disadvantage to non-U.S. competitors. This could reduce the revenue and profitability of JPMorgan Chases wholesale businesses, resulting from: ##TABLE_START  prohibitions on engaging in certain transactions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  higher capital and liquidity requirements ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  making JPMorgan Chases pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  adversely affecting JPMorgan Chases cost structure for providing certain products. ##TABLE_END People JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success. JPMorgan Chases employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer or members of the Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chases performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected. Changes in immigration policies could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. There is the potential for changes in immigration policies in multiple jurisdictions around the world, including in the U.S. If immigration policies were to unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for qualified employees to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business, JPMorgan Chase could be adversely affected. Legal JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from private actions and formal and informal regulatory investigations. JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations. Regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chases businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions. If another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by JPMorgan Chase. These and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services. All of these potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chases reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chases profitability, or result in collateral consequences.

The internal control framework promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), Internal Control  Integrated Framework (COSO 2013) provides guidance for designing, implementing and conducting internal control and assessing its effectiveness. The Firm used the COSO 2013 framework to assess the effectiveness of the Firms internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 . See Managements report on internal control over financial reporting on page 146 . As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firms management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certifications issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the future. For further information, see Managements report on internal control over financial reporting on page 146 . There was no change in the Firms internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended  December 31, 2017 , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firms internal control over financial reporting. ", "9B": " Item 9B. Other Information. Iran threat reduction disclosure Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. Disclosure may be required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. Except as set forth below, as of the date of this report, the Firm is not aware of any other activity, transaction or dealing by any of its affiliates during the calendar year 2017 that requires disclosure under Section 219. As previously disclosed, during the first quarter of 2017, a non-U.S. subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase processed a payment in the amount of EUR 1,466 for its client, a non-U.S. international organization, where the payment originated from entities owned or controlled by the Government of Iran. JPMorgan Chase charged a fee of EUR 2.50 for this transaction. In addition to the previously disclosed transaction, the Firm identified four other payments made in 2017 in the amounts of $68,567, $66,280, $98,143, and $110,831, that were processed by JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and a non-U.S. subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase for a client, a U.S.-based international publishing business, where the payments originated from educational institutions owned or controlled by the Government of Iran. JPMorgan Chase charged total fees of $3,930 for these transactions. Each of the above payments received into both clients accounts, were for the purchase of informational materials, and they were therefore exempt transactions pursuant to 31. C.F.R. 560.210(c), and were all processed in compliance with the Iran-related sanctions regulations.  JPMorgan Chase may in the future engage in similar transactions for its clients to the extent permitted by U.S. law. ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart III ", "10": " Item 10.

Business. Overview JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPMorgan Chase or the Firm, NYSE: JPM), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States of America (U.S.) , with operations worldwide; JPMorgan Chase had $2.6 trillion in assets and $256.5 billion in stockholders equity as of December 31, 2018 . The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands, the Firm serves millions of customers in the U.S. and globally many of the worlds most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients. JPMorgan Chases principal bank subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), a national banking association with U.S. branches in 27 states and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2018, and Chase Bank USA, National Association (Chase Bank USA, N.A.), a national banking association that is the Firms principal credit card-issuing bank. In January 2019, the OCC approved an application of merger which was filed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. in December 2018 and which contemplates that Chase Bank USA, N.A. will merge with and into JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as the surviving bank. For additional information refer to Supervision and Regulation on pages 1-6 in the 2018 Form 10-K. JPMorgan Chases principal nonbank subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (J.P. Morgan Securities), a U.S. broker-dealer. The bank and non-bank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase operate nationally as well as through overseas branches and subsidiaries, representative offices and subsidiary foreign banks. The Firms principal operating subsidiary in the U.K. is J.P. Morgan Securities plc, a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Firms website is www.jpmorganchase.com. JPMorgan Chase makes available on its website, free of charge, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files or furnishes such material to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) at www.sec.gov. The Firm has adopted, and posted on its website, a Code of Conduct for all employees of the Firm and a Code of Ethics for its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and all other professionals of the Firm worldwide serving in a finance, accounting, tax or investor relations role. Business segments JPMorgan Chases activities are organized, for management reporting purposes, into four major reportable business segments, as well as a Corporate segment. The Firms consumer business is the Consumer  Community Banking (CCB) segment. The Firms wholesale business segments are the Corporate  Investment Bank (CIB), Commercial Banking (CB), and Asset  Wealth Management (AWM). A description of the Firms business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases is provided in the Business segment results section of Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (Managements discussion and analysis or MDA), beginning on page 42 and in Note 31 . Competition JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in highly competitive environments. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, investment managers, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, financial technology companies, and other companies engaged in providing similar products and services. The Firms businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firms products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. With respect to some of its geographies and products, JPMorgan Chase competes globally; with respect to others, the Firm competes on a national or regional basis. The Firms ability to compete also depends upon its ability to attract and retain professional and other personnel, and on its reputation. Competition in the financial services industry continues to be intense. In some cases, the Firms businesses compete with other financial institutions that may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies or that operate under different rules and regulatory regimes than the Firm, and with companies that provide new or innovative products or services, including those that the Firm does not provide. Supervision and regulation The Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as the applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business. The Firm has experienced an extended period of significant change in regulation which has had and could continue to have significant consequences for how the Firm conducts business in the U.S. and other countries. ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I Financial holding company: Consolidated supervision . JPMorgan Chase  Co. is a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company (FHC) under U.S. federal law, and is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve). The Federal Reserve acts as an umbrella regulator, and certain of JPMorgan Chases subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional authorities based on the activities of those subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chases national bank subsidiaries, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., are supervised and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and, with respect to certain matters, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC). In January 2019, the OCC approved an application of merger which was filed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. in December 2018 and which contemplates that Chase Bank USA, N.A. will merge with and into JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as the surviving bank. Completion of the merger, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2019, will be subject to customary closing conditions which will be set forth in an agreement and plan of merger to be entered into between the banks. The merger may be abandoned by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. at any time before completion. JPMorgan Chases U.S. broker-dealers are supervised and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and subsidiaries of the Firm that engage in certain futures-related and swaps-related activities are supervised and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a U.K. bank licensed within the European Economic Area (the EEA), and is regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (the PRA) and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The Firms other non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the banking and securities regulatory authorities in the countries in which they operate. Permissible business activities . The Bank Holding Company Act generally restricts BHCs from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely-related activities. FHCs can engage in a broader range of financial activities, including underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities, and making merchant banking investments in non-financial companies. The Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an FHCs ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities if the FHC or any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable eligibility requirements. The Federal Reserve may also impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the FHC, and if deficiencies are persistent, may require divestiture of the FHCs depository institutions. If any depository institution controlled by an FHC fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit the FHC and its subsidiaries from engaging in any activities other than those permissible for BHCs. Capital and liquidity requirements . The Federal Reserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage requirements for JPMorgan Chase and evaluates the Firms compliance with those requirements. The OCC establishes similar requirements for the Firms national banking subsidiaries. Banking supervisors globally continue to refine and enhance the Basel III capital framework for financial institutions, including the finalization of post-crisis reforms. In January 2019, the Basel Committee issued Minimum capital requirements for market risk, which supersedes a previous release from January 2016. The Basel Committee expects national regulators to implement these revised market risk requirements for banking organizations in their jurisdictions by January 1, 2022, in line with the other elements of the Basel III Reforms. U.S. banking regulators have announced their support for the issuance of the Basel III Reforms and are considering how to appropriately apply such reforms in the U.S. Any changes to U.S. capital rules based on the Basel III Reforms would first be proposed for public comment. In October 2018, the U.S. banking regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking Standardized Approach for Calculating the Exposure Amount of Derivatives (SA-CCR), with an implementation date of July 1, 2020. This proposal reflects the U.S implementation of the Basel Committees equivalent standard, which was finalized in 2014 as part of the post-crisis reform package. Under Basel III, bank holding companies and banks are required to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests: the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). In April 2016, the U.S. banking regulators issued a proposed rule for NSFR, but no final rule has been issued. For more information concerning capital and liquidity requirements, refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85-94 and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 95100 . Stress tests . As a large BHC, JPMorgan Chase is subject to supervisory stress testing administered by the Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserves annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) framework. The Firm must conduct semi-annual company-run stress tests and must also submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by the Firm and the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserves review of the Firms capital plan considers both quantitative and qualitative factors. The Firm is required to receive a notice of non-objection from the Federal Reserve each year before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital ##TABLE_START 2   ##TABLE_ENDinstruments. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. to perform separate, similar stress tests annually. The Firm publishes each year the results of its mid-cycle stress tests under the Firms internally-developed severely adverse scenario and the results of the annual stress tests for the Firm and its principal banking subsidiaries under the supervisory severely adverse scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The Firm is required to file its 2019 annual CCAR submission on April 5, 2019. Results will be published by the Federal Reserve by June 30, 2019, with disclosures of results by BHCs, including the Firm, to follow within 15 days. The mid-cycle capital stress test submissions are due on October 5, 2019 and BHCs, including the Firm, will publish results by November 4, 2019. For more information concerning the Firms CCAR, refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85-94 . Enhanced prudential standards . As part of its mandate to identify and monitor risks to the financial stability of the U.S. posed by large banking organizations, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) recommends prudential standards and reporting requirements to the Federal Reserve for systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), such as JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve has adopted several rules to implement those heightened prudential standards, including rules relating to risk management and corporate governance of subject BHCs. Large BHCs such as JPMorgan Chase are required to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, including oversight by the board of directors of risk management activities. Orderly liquidation authority and resolution and recovery . The Firm is required to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for resolution under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) in the event of material distress or failure (a resolution plan). The Firms next resolution plan is due to be filed on or before July 1, 2019. The Firm also has a comprehensive recovery plan detailing the actions it would take to avoid failure by remaining well-capitalized and well-funded in the case of an adverse event. Certain financial companies, including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its subsidiaries, can also be subjected to resolution under an orderly liquidation authority. The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States, must first make certain determinations concerning extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk, and action must be recommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent such actions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain subject to resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC has issued a draft policy statement describing its single point of entry strategy for resolution of SIFIs under the orderly liquidation authority, which seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of a BHC open and impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the BHC in receivership according to their statutory order of priority. The FDIC has not formally adopted its proposed single point of entry strategy. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. are both required to provide resolution plans to the FDIC. The FDIC is expected to propose changes to its rules relating to the resolution plans of insured depository institutions (IDIs) in an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking. The OCC has published guidelines establishing standards for recovery planning by insured national banks, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. have submitted their recovery plans to the OCC. Certain of the Firms non-U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to resolution and recovery planning requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Holding company as source of strength. JPMorgan Chase  Co. is required to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries, including when directed to do so by the Federal Reserve. Regulation of acquisitions . Acquisitions by BHCs and their banks are subject to multiple requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs are required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before they may acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of an unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by financial companies are prohibited if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies. Furthermore, for certain acquisitions, the Firm must provide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company with over $10 billion in assets that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature. Volcker Rule . The Volcker Rule prohibits banking entities, including the Firm, from engaging in certain proprietary trading activities, subject to exceptions for underwriting, market-making, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. The Volcker Rule also limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, covered funds, and imposes limits on certain transactions between the Firm and covered funds for which a JPMorgan Chase entity serves as the investment manager, investment advisor, commodity trading advisor or sponsor, as well as certain covered funds controlled by such funds. The Volcker Rule requires banking entities to establish comprehensive compliance programs reasonably designed to help ensure and monitor compliance with the restrictions under the Volcker Rule. Consent orders . The Firm remains subject to consent orders entered into with its banking regulators between 2013 and 2016 concerning anti-money laundering, the CIO investigation, foreign exchange trading and referral hiring practices. ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I JPMorgan Chases subsidiary banks: The activities of the Firms principal subsidiary banks, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., are limited to those specifically authorized under the National Bank Act and related interpretations of the OCC. FDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance fund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits and is funded through assessments on banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. FDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon the insolvency of an IDI, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., the FDIC could be appointed as the conservator or receiver under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA). The FDIC has broad powers to transfer any assets and liabilities without the approval of the institutions creditors. Cross-guarantee. An FDIC-insured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the FDIC if another FDIC-insured institution that is under common control with such institution is in default or is deemed to be in danger of default (commonly referred to as cross-guarantee liability). An FDIC cross-guarantee claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution. Prompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. Although these regulations apply only to banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. , the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against the parent BHC , such as JPMorgan Chase  Co., based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In certain instances, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary. OCC Heightened Standards. The OCC has established guidelines setting forth heightened standards for large banks, including minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks. Under these standards, a banks risk governance framework must ensure that the banks risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from that of its parent BHC for risk management purposes. The banks board or risk committee is responsible for approving the banks risk governance framework, providing active oversight of the banks risk-taking activities, and holding management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework. Restrictions on transactions with affiliates. The bank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase (including subsidiaries of those banks) are subject to restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, investments in stock or securities of, and derivatives, securities lending and certain other transactions with, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and certain other affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan Chase  Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from such subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts and comply with certain other requirements. Dividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. Refer to Note 25 for the amount of dividends that the Firms principal bank subsidiaries could pay, at January 1, 2019, to their respective BHCs without the approval of their banking regulators. The OCC and the Federal Reserve also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends of the bank subsidiaries that they supervise if, in the banking regulators opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank. Depositor preference. Under federal law, the claims of a receiver of an IDI for administrative expense and the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and deposits in non-U.S. branches that are dually payable in the U.S. and in a non-U.S. branch) have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including depositors in non-U.S. branches and public noteholders. Consumer supervision and regulation. JPMorgan Chase and its national bank subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. These laws include the Truth-in-Lending, Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), Fair Credit Reporting, Fair Debt Collection Practice, Electronic Funds Transfer, Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) and Home Mortgage Disclosure Acts. The CFPB also has jurisdiction over small business lending activities with respect to fair lending and ECOA. As part of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has authority to take enforcement actions against firms that offer certain products and services to consumers using practices that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. The Firms consumer activities are also subject to regulation under state statutes which are enforced by the Attorney General of each state. Securities and broker-dealer regulation: The Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and other non-bank broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations of the SEC, FINRA and the New York Stock Exchange, among others. The Firm conducts similar securities activities outside the U.S. subject to local regulatory requirements. In the U.K., those activities are conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and ##TABLE_START 4   ##TABLE_ENDregulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customer funds, the financing of client purchases, capital structure, record-keeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers and employees. For information concerning the capital of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc, refer to Broker-dealer regulatory capital on page 94 . Investment management regulation: The Firms asset and wealth management businesses are subject to significant regulation in jurisdictions around the world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding and management of client assets, offerings of funds and marketing activities. Certain of the Firms subsidiaries are registered with, and subject to oversight by, the SEC as investment advisers. The Firms registered investment advisers are subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as well as various state securities laws. The Firms fiduciary activities are also subject to supervision by the OCC. The Firms asset and wealth management businesses continue to be affected by ongoing rule-making and implementation of new regulations, including the SECs proposed Regulation Best Interest and rules proposed or adopted by certain U.S. states relating to enhanced standards of conduct for broker-dealers and certain other market participants. In June 2018, the Department of Labors fiduciary rule, which would have significantly expanded the universe of persons viewed as investment advice fiduciaries to retirement plans and individual retirement accounts under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In the European Union (EU), substantial revisions to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) became effective in EU member states beginning in January 2018. These revisions introduced expanded requirements for a broad range of investment management activities, including product governance, transparency on costs and charges, independent investment advice, inducements, record-keeping and client reporting. In addition, the Regulation on Money Market Funds has instituted new requirements to enhance the liquidity and stability of money market funds in the EU. Derivatives regulation: The Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its derivatives businesses, including regulations that impose capital and margin requirements, require central clearing of standardized over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, mandate that certain standardized over-the-counter swaps be traded on regulated trading venues, and provide for reporting of certain mandated information. In accordance with requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc have registered with the CFTC as swap dealers and may be required to register with the SEC as security-based swap dealers. As a result, these entities are or will be subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to their swap or security-based swap activities, including capital requirements, rules requiring the collateralization of uncleared swaps and security-based swaps, rules regarding segregation of counterparty collateral, business conduct and documentation standards, record-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-fraud and anti-manipulation requirements. In the EU, the implementation of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and MiFID II has resulted in comparable, but not identical, changes to the European regulatory regime for derivatives. The Firm and other derivatives market participants have agreed to adhere to the 2015 Universal Resolution Stay Protocol (the 2015 Protocol), the 2018 U.S. Resolution Stay Protocol (the 2018 Protocol) and the Resolution Stay Jurisdictional Modular Protocol, each developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) in response to regulator concerns that the close-out of derivatives and other financial transactions during the resolution of a large cross-border financial institution could impede resolution efforts and potentially destabilize markets. These protocols provide for the contractual recognition of cross-border stays under various statutory resolution regimes and, in the case of the 2015 Protocol and 2018 Protocol, a contractual stay on certain cross-default rights. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is registered with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant, and is a member of the National Futures Association. Data and cyber regulation: The Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state as well as international laws and regulations concerning the collection, use, confidentiality, disclosure, transfer, protection and handling of information, including personal information of individuals and confidential information (including the EU General Data Protection Regulation), as well as the management of internal and external threats and vulnerabilities to protect information assets and the supporting infrastructure from cyberattacks. These laws and regulations are evolving at a rapid pace, remain a focus of regulators globally and will continue to have a significant impact on all of the Firms businesses. The Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions: The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires all financial institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers, to establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA includes a variety of record-keeping and reporting requirements, as well as due diligence/know-your-customer documentation requirements. The Firm is also subject to the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). In addition, the EU has adopted various economic sanctions ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I programs targeted at countries that are involved in terrorism, hostilities, embezzlement or human rights violations. Anti-Corruption: The Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Compensation practices: The Firms compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as other agencies. The Federal Reserve has issued guidance jointly with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed to ensure that incentive compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the organizations safety and soundness. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has also established standards covering compensation principles for banks. The Firms compensation practices are also subject to regulation and oversight by regulators in other jurisdictions. In Europe, the EU Fourth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) includes compensation-related provisions, and the European Banking Authority has instituted guidelines on compensation policies which in certain countries, such as the U.K., are implemented or supplemented by local regulations or guidelines. The Firm expects that the implementation of regulatory guidelines regarding compensation in the U.S. and other countries will continue to evolve, and may affect the manner in which the Firm structures its compensation programs and practices. Significant international regulatory initiatives: The EU continues to implement an extensive and complex program of regulatory enhancement to address risks associated with global financial institutions. The EU operates a European Systemic Risk Board that monitors financial stability and encourages supervisory convergence across the EUs member states, and European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) are responsible for adopting and implementing related rules. The EU is currently reviewing the ESA framework and the European Commission (the EC) has proposed legislation to change the roles and responsibilities of the ESAs. The EU has also created a Single Supervisory Mechanism for the euro-zone, under which the regulation of all banks in the zone are under the auspices of the European Central Bank, together with a Single Resolution Mechanism and Single Resolution Board, which has jurisdiction over the resolution of banks in the zone. Significant regulatory initiatives affecting the Firms businesses in the EU include EMIR and MiFID II. EMIR requires the central clearing of certain standardized derivatives and risk mitigation for uncleared OTC derivatives. EMIR is currently in the process of being amended as part of a legislative proposal known as EMIR REFIT, which will introduce targeted changes to EMIR to make the rules more streamlined and proportionate. There is also a separate EMIR legislative proposal which includes provisions for third-country supervision of CCPs. MiFID II requires that the trading of standardized OTC derivatives be effected on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, and also significantly enhanced requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency, transaction reporting and investor protection, and introduced position limits and a reporting regime for commodities. MiFID II became effective across EU member states in January 2018 and will be subject to a review by the EC by March 2020. The EU has also proposed or implemented significant revisions to laws covering securities settlement; mutual funds and pensions; payments; anti-money laundering controls; data security and privacy; transparency and disclosure of securities financing transactions; benchmarks; resolution of banks, investment firms and market infrastructures; and capital and liquidity requirements for banks and investment firms. The EU capital and liquidity legislation for banks and investment firms is implementing many of the finalized Basel III capital and liquidity standards, including in relation to the leverage ratio, market risk capital, and a net stable funding ratio. EU legislation also contemplates a requirement for certain non-EU banks operating in the EU to establish an intermediate parent undertaking (IPU) located in the EU. The full impact of the IPU proposal on JPMorgan Chases operations and legal entities in the EU will be heavily influenced by the outcome of the EU legislative process, including whether any flexibility is introduced to the requirement. The trilogue negotiations to determine the final legislation have concluded and the agreement is subject to a final vote by the European Council and European Parliament before becoming EU law. The FSBs standard relating to total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), which was issued in November 2015, specified minimum TLAC requirements for global systemically important banks, including at the level of their material sub-groups. These requirements are being implemented in the EU in the form of a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). The Bank of England published its updated Statement of Policy on its approach to setting MREL in June 2018. This included new requirements on the MREL resources to be held by U.K. material subsidiaries of overseas groups. These rules came into effect, on a transitional basis, from January 1, 2019. U.K. regulators have adopted a range of policy measures that have significantly changed the markets and prudential regulatory environment in the U.K., and have also introduced measures to enhance accountability of individuals and promote forward-looking conduct risk identification and mitigation. There is significant uncertainty concerning future U.K. policy initiatives in light of the expected departure of the U.K. from the EU, as these initiatives will depend on the future relationship between the EU and U.K. For information concerning the expected departure of the U.K. from the EU, refer to Risk factors on pages 728 and Business developments on page 46 . ##TABLE_START 6   ##TABLE_END", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chases financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Any of the risk factors discussed below could by itself, or combined with other factors, materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation, including by materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues, which could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings. Regulatory JPMorgan Chases businesses are highly regulated, and the laws and regulations that apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its business and operations. JPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business. The regulation of financial services is extensive and comprehensive. JPMorgan Chase has experienced an extended period of significant change in laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry, both within and outside the U.S. The supervision of financial services firms also expanded significantly during this period. The wave of increased regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase has affected the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations. Existing and new laws and regulations and expanded supervision could require JPMorgan Chase to make further changes to its business and operations. These changes could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs for complying with laws and regulations and could reduce JPMorgan Chases profitability. More specifically, existing and new laws and regulations could require JPMorgan Chase to: ##TABLE_START  limit the products and services that it offers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  stop or discourage it from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  recognize losses in the value of assets that it holds ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pay higher assessments, levies or other governmental charges ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  impose restrictions on certain business activities, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increase the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them. ##TABLE_END Differences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for JPMorgan Chases business. The content and application of laws and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. For example: ##TABLE_START  larger firms are often subject to more stringent supervision and regulation ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  financial technology companies and other non-traditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction. ##TABLE_END These types of differences in the regulatory framework can result in a firm such as JPMorgan Chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial products. There can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in other countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory initiative or standard, a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements, which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that may be subject to those enhanced regulations. Legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements. These include laws and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to: ##TABLE_START  the resolution of financial institutions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the establishment of locally-based intermediate holding companies ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the separation (or ring fencing) of core banking products and services from markets activities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  requirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties (CCPs) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  position limits and reporting rules for derivatives ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  governance and accountability regimes ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  conduct of business requirements, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  restrictions on compensation. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I These types of differences in financial services regulation, or inconsistencies or conflicts between laws and regulations between different jurisdictions, could require JPMorgan Chase to: ##TABLE_START  divest assets or restructure its operations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  absorb increased operational, capital and liquidity costs ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  change the prices that it charges for its products and services ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks. ##TABLE_END Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chases ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chases businesses, results of operations and profitability. Governments in some countries or regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business have adopted laws or regulations which require JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries that operate in those jurisdictions to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity on a stand-alone basis. Some regulators outside the U.S. have also proposed that large banks which conduct certain businesses in their jurisdictions operate through separate subsidiaries located in those jurisdictions. These requirements, and any future laws or regulations that impose restrictions on the way JPMorgan Chase organizes its businesses or increase the capital or liquidity requirements that would apply to JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries, could hinder JPMorgan Chases ability to efficiently manage its operations, increase its funding and liquidity costs, and result in lower profitability. Heightened regulatory scrutiny of JPMorgan Chases businesses has increased its compliance costs and could result in restrictions on its operations. JPMorgan Chases operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions where JPMorgan Chase does business. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving several investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar regulatory resolutions or other actions in the future, and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs or needing to comply with other restrictions. In connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the resolution. These types of admissions can lead to: ##TABLE_START  greater exposure in civil litigation ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  damage to reputation ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other direct and indirect adverse effects. ##TABLE_END Furthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have demanded that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution, including: ##TABLE_START  loss of clients, customers and business ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  restrictions on offering certain products or services, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  losing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or permanently. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase expects that it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions. JPMorgan Chase also expects that regulators will continue to insist that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions. Furthermore, if JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators, it could be required to: ##TABLE_START  enter into further resolutions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pay additional regulatory fines, penalties or judgments, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of, its businesses. ##TABLE_END In these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also become subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action. The long-term impact of U.S. tax reform legislation is uncertain, and may be affected by regulatory implementation. The long-term impact of the Tax Cuts  Jobs Acts (TCJA) on JPMorgan Chase and the U.S. economy remains uncertain. While the enactment of the TCJA has had, and should continue to have, a positive impact on JPMorgan Chases net income, the competitive environment and other ##TABLE_START 8   ##TABLE_ENDfactors will influence the extent to which these benefits are retained by JPMorgan Chase over the longer term, and the specific impact on JPMorgan Chases businesses, products and geographies may vary. In addition, the Treasury Regulations governing certain TCJA provisions have not been finalized and their ultimate impact on JPMorgan Chase is uncertain. Complying with economic sanctions and anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations can increase JPMorgan Chases operational and compliance costs and risks. JPMorgan Chase must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and similar national and multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S., as well as anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations throughout the world. JPMorgan Chase can incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating its businesses to comply with these requirements. Furthermore, a violation of a sanction or embargo program or anti-corruption or anti-money laundering laws and regulations could subject JPMorgan Chase, and individual employees, to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties. JPMorgan Chases operations can be constrained in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks. If the legal and regulatory system in a particular country is less established or predictable, this can create a more difficult environment in which to conduct business. For example, any of the following could hamper JPMorgan Chases operations and reduce its earnings in countries with less established or predictable legal and regulatory regimes: ##TABLE_START  the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the adoption of conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  uncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual obligations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions, the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies. ##TABLE_END Conducting business in countries with less-developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires JPMorgan Chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems or that JPMorgan Chase will be able to develop effective working relationships with local regulators. Requirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses. JPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in the event of material financial distress or failure. The agencies evaluation of the Firms resolution plan may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities, which could increase its funding or operational costs. If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were to determine that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on JPMorgan Chases growth, activities or operations. After two years, if the deficiencies are not cured, the agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases operations and strategy. Holders of JPMorgan Chase  Co.s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution. Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase  Co. (the Parent Company) maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity with specific terms (eligible LTD) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chases operating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution either: ##TABLE_START  in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (Title II). ##TABLE_END If the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company will absorb the losses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I The preferred single point of entry strategy under JPMorgan Chases resolution plan contemplates that only the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy proceedings. JPMorgan Chases subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent Companys losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the Parent Companys equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chases subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company. Accordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the Parent Company would realize value only to the extent available to the Parent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully repaid. The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the Parent Company, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy. If the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chases preferred strategy, and losses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than they might have been under JPMorgan Chases preferred strategy. Political The expected departure of the U.K. from the EU could negatively affect JPMorgan Chases business, results of operations and operating model. It remains highly uncertain how the expected departure of the U.K. from the EU, which is commonly referred to as Brexit, will affect financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase that conduct substantial operations in the EU from legal entities that are organized in or operating from the U.K. It is possible that the U.K. will depart from the EU in March 2019 without any agreement having been reached between the U.K. and the EU concerning whether or to what extent U.K.-based firms may conduct financial services activities within the EU. It is also possible that any agreement reached between the U.K. and the EU may, depending on the final outcome of the ongoing negotiations and related legislative developments: ##TABLE_START  impede the ability of U.K.-based financial services firms to conduct business in the EU ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  fail to address significant unresolved issues relating to the cross-border conduct of financial services activities, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  apply only temporarily. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase has been making the necessary modifications to its legal entity structure and operations in the EU, the locations in which it operates and the staffing in those locations to address the expected departure of the U.K. from the EU, including the possibility that the U.K. may depart from the EU in March 2019 without a withdrawal agreement in place. If the U.K. departs from the EU with no withdrawal agreement having been reached, the types of structural and operational changes that JPMorgan Chase is in the process of making to its European operations will result in JPMorgan Chase having to sustain a more fragmented operating model across its U.K., EU and other operating entities. Due to considerations such as operating expenses, liquidity, leverage and capital, the modified European operating framework will be more complex, less efficient and more costly than would otherwise have been the case. JPMorgan Chase may experience these types of inefficiencies in its business and operations even if a withdrawal agreement is reached, for example in the event that during the transition period contemplated by such an agreement, the U.K. and the EU fail to reach further agreement on future trade relationships between the U.K. and the EU, or if any other outcome persists that does not assure ongoing access for U.K.-based financial services firms to the EU market. A disorderly departure of the U.K. from the EU, or the unexpected consequences of any departure, could have significant and immediate destabilizing effects on cross-border financial services activities, depending on circumstances that may exist following such a withdrawal, including: ##TABLE_START  the possibility that clients and counterparties of financial institutions are not positioned to continue to do business through EU-based legal entities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reduction or fragmentation of market liquidity that may be caused if trading venues or CCPs currently based in the U.K. have not completed arrangements to conduct operations from the EU either immediately or, if authorized to continue to operate from the U.K. on a transitional basis, after any transitional relief has expired ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  uncertainties concerning the application and interpretation of laws and regulations relating to cross-border financial services activities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inability to engage in certain capital markets activities through EU-based legal entities to the extent that licenses or temporary permission to engage in such activities have not been granted timely by local regulators, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 10   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  lack of legal certainty concerning the treatment of existing transactions. ##TABLE_END Any or all of the above factors could have an adverse effect on the overall operation of the European financial services market as well as JPMorgan Chases business, operations and earnings in the U.K., the EU and globally. Economic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can hurt JPMorgan Chases businesses. The economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates continue to be uncertain due to political developments in the U.S. and other countries. Certain policy initiatives and proposals could cause a contraction in U.S. and global economic growth and higher volatility in the financial markets, including: ##TABLE_START  inability to reach political consensus to keep the U.S. government open and funded ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  isolationist foreign policies ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the introduction of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the possible withdrawal or reduction of government support for the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the GSEs). ##TABLE_END These types of political developments, and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments, could: ##TABLE_START  erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets, which could potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in diplomatic relations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increase concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or governments in other countries. ##TABLE_END These factors could lead to: ##TABLE_START  greater market volatility ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  large-scale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the U.S. and other countries ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the widening of credit spreads ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inflationary pressures ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  lower investment growth, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other market dislocations. ##TABLE_END Any of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses on its market-making positions or in its investment securities portfolio, reduce its liquidity and capital levels, hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers, and weaken its results of operations and financial condition. Market JPMorgan Chases businesses are materially affected by economic and market events and conditions. JPMorgan Chases results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following: ##TABLE_START  investor, consumer and business sentiment ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  events that reduce confidence in the financial markets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inflation or deflation ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening labor market ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the availability and cost of capital and credit ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  monetary and fiscal policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities, including any suspension or reversal of large-scale asset purchases ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  trade policies implemented by governmental authorities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the economic effects of natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health emergencies or pandemics, cyberattacks, outbreaks of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the health of the U.S. and global economies. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions. JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. and global economic conditions, including: ##TABLE_START  interest rates ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the rates of inflation and unemployment ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  housing prices ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the level of consumer and small business confidence ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the number of personal bankruptcies. ##TABLE_END A rapid increase in interest rates could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts. Sustained low growth, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses. These conditions could also increase the cost to provide those products and services. Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chases earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies where high levels of unemployment have resulted from declining industrial or manufacturing activity, ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I or where high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding student loans, impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations. JPMorgan Chases earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers, including: ##TABLE_START  policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, education, immigration and employment status ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the inability to reach political consensus to keep the U.S. government open and funded, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as infrastructure spending and global trade, which could result in higher inflation or reductions in consumer disposable income. ##TABLE_END In addition, governmental proposals to permit student loan obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings could, if enacted into law, encourage certain of JPMorgan Chases customers to declare personal bankruptcy and thereby trigger defaults and charge-offs of credit card and other consumer loans extended to those customers. Unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chases wholesale businesses. In JPMorgan Chases wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings. Furthermore, if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chases capital markets businesses could be reduced to the extent that those businesses: ##TABLE_START  earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  dispose of portions of credit commitments, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings, at a loss, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices. ##TABLE_END An adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices, could have a material adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments, as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the economy that is under stress. The fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or holds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan Chases revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance. An economic downturn that results in lower consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chases wholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan Chases earnings from its wholesale operations. For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chases wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients. Severe and sustained adverse economic conditions could reduce the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from those properties which, in turn, could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans. These consequences could result in JPMorgan Chase experiencing higher delinquencies, defaults and write-offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chases earnings from its wholesale businesses. JPMorgan Chases investment securities portfolio and market-making positions can suffer losses due to adverse economic, market and political events and conditions. JPMorgan Chase generally maintains positions in various fixed income instruments in its investment securities portfolio, and positions in various fixed income, currency, commodity, credit and equity instruments as part of its market-making activities. Market-making positions are intended to facilitate demand from JPMorgan Chases clients for these instruments and to provide liquidity for clients. The value of the positions that JPMorgan Chase holds can be significantly affected by factors such as: ##TABLE_START  JPMorgan Chases ability to effectively hedge market and other risks on its positions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the levels and volatility of interest rates, credit spreads, and market prices for currencies, equities and commodities, and the duration of any changes in levels or volatility, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 12   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the availability of liquidity in the capital markets. ##TABLE_END All of these are affected by global economic, market and political events and conditions, as well as regulatory restrictions on market-making activities. JPMorgan Chases investment securities portfolio and market-making businesses can also suffer losses due to unanticipated market events, including: ##TABLE_START  severe declines in asset values ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unexpected credit events ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa), or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument. ##TABLE_END If JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its investment securities portfolio or from market-making activities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chases profitability and its liquidity and capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses. Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of JPMorgan Chases revenue and income streams. JPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income when interest rates are increasing. However, higher interest rates can also lead to: ##TABLE_START  fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  losses on underwriting exposures ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  lower returns on JPMorgan Chases investment securities portfolio ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the loss of deposits to the extent that JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  less liquidity in the financial markets and higher funding costs. ##TABLE_END All of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chases revenues and its liquidity and capital levels. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chases consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans. On the other hand, a low interest rate environment may cause: ##TABLE_START  net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chases mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) asset, thereby decreasing revenues. ##TABLE_END When credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chases credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chases credit spreads will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chases earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value. JPMorgan Chases results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments. The value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments, particularly during periods of market displacement. Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chases results of operations. Under extreme market conditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating losses as they would be under more normal market conditions. Furthermore, under these conditions, market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale. JPMorgan Chases risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk to more extreme market moves. However, severe market events have historically been difficult to predict and JPMorgan Chase could realize significant losses if extreme market events were to occur. ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I Credit JPMorgan Chase can be adversely affected by the financial condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs. JPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, investment managers and other types of financial institutions. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation in the event that a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations, including under the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive. A default by a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace those contracts, thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses. JPMorgan Chase can also be exposed to losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a portion of those losses. Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can also impair JPMorgan Chases ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause harm to JPMorgan Chases reputation. JPMorgan Chases businesses can be harmed by the insolvency of a significant market participant. The failure of a significant market participant, such as a major financial institution or a CCP, or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant, can have a cascading effect within the financial markets. JPMorgan Chases businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting. These risks could be magnified in the event of the default, insolvency or resolution of a major global financial counterparty, as JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such a counterparty, and would seek to unwind or hedge positions in securities, derivatives and other obligations in multiple jurisdictions during a period of heightened market volatility. JPMorgan Chases clearing services business is exposed to the risk of client or counterparty default. As part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is a member of several CCPs. In the event that another member of such an organization defaults on its obligations to the CCP, JPMorgan Chase may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the CCP as a result of that default. As a clearing member, JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase is exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the clients bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events can increase JPMorgan Chases operational and litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to bearing its share of nondefault losses incurred by a CCP due to a business or operational failure affecting the CCP, including due to a cyberattack, litigation, fraud or a systems failure. JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions. During periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan Chases credit risk may be further increased when JPMorgan Chase cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to it. Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral. JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk. JPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties: ##TABLE_START  engage in similar or related businesses, or in businesses in related industries ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  do business in the same geographic region, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  have business profiles, models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. ##TABLE_END For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of JPMorgan Chases borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other ##TABLE_START 14   ##TABLE_ENDborrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chases credit, liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value losses in its market-making businesses. Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chases borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those risks may not be successful. JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment. Disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets could cause JPMorgan Chase to be unable to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions in various debt instruments, loans, derivatives and other obligations, and thereby lead to increased risk concentrations. If JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of risk-weighted assets (RWA) that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could increase JPMorgan Chases capital requirements and funding costs and adversely affect the profitability of JPMorgan Chases businesses. Liquidity Liquidity is critical to JPMorgan Chases ability to fund and operate its businesses. JPMorgan Chases liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as: ##TABLE_START  market-wide illiquidity or disruption ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unforeseen cash or capital requirements ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  default by a CCP or other significant market participant ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unexpected loss of consumer deposits caused by changes in consumer behavior, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial institutions in general. ##TABLE_END A diminution of JPMorgan Chases liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control. For example, during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, periods of low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity resulted in higher funding costs for JPMorgan Chase and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity, including securitized debt issuances. There is no assurance that severe conditions of this type will not occur in the future. JPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan Chases funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order to: ##TABLE_START  satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  address obligations under its resolution plan, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities. ##TABLE_END More generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses, and thereby adversely affect its results of operations. JPMorgan Chase  Co. is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities. JPMorgan Chase  Co. is a holding company that holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the IHC). The IHC in turn holds the stock of substantially all of JPMorgan Chases subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and intercompany indebtedness owing to the holding company. The holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to make payments to the holding company is also ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I limited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chases management or Board of Directors. As a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. These limitations could affect the holding companys ability to: ##TABLE_START  pay interest on its debt securities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pay dividends on its equity securities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  fulfill its other payment obligations. ##TABLE_END These regulatory restrictions and limitations could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the IHC is subject. Reductions in JPMorgan Chases credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding. JPMorgan Chase  Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate both general and firm-specific and industry-specific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including: ##TABLE_START  expected future profitability ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  risk management practices ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  legal expenses ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regulatory developments ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  assumptions about government support, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  economic and geopolitical trends ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings. However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan Chases credit ratings will not be lowered in the future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chases options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low. A reduction in JPMorgan Chases credit ratings could curtail JPMorgan Chases business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including: ##TABLE_START  reducing its access to capital markets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  triggering additional collateral or funding requirements, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorgan Chase. ##TABLE_END Any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase  Co. and its subsidiaries. This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase  Co. and its subsidiaries. The regulation, reform and replacement of benchmark rates could have adverse consequences on JPMorgan Chases securities issuances and its capital markets and investment activities. Interest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be benchmarks, including those in widespread and long-standing use, have been the subject of ongoing international, national and other regulatory scrutiny and initiatives and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented or are under consideration. These reforms may cause benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated. Any of the benchmark reforms which have been proposed or implemented, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could also increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of benchmarks and complying with regulations or requirements relating to benchmarks. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain benchmarks or lead to the disappearance of certain benchmarks. Any of these developments, and any future initiatives to regulate, reform or change the administration of benchmarks, could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of and market for loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark, including those issued, funded or held by JPMorgan Chase. Various regulators, industry bodies and other market participants in the U.S. and other countries are engaged in initiatives to develop, introduce and encourage the use of alternative rates to replace certain benchmarks. There is no assurance that these new rates will be accepted or widely used by market participants, or that the characteristics of any of these new rates will be similar to, or produce the economic equivalent of, the benchmarks that they seek to replace. If a particular benchmark were to be discontinued and an alternative rate has not been successfully introduced to replace that benchmark, this could result in widespread ##TABLE_START 16   ##TABLE_ENDdislocation in the financial markets, engender volatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives and other instruments, and suppress capital markets activities, all of which could have adverse effects on JPMorgan Chases results of operations. In addition, the transition of a particular benchmark to a replacement rate could affect hedge accounting relationships between financial instruments linked to that benchmark and any related derivatives, which could adversely affect JPMorgan Chases results. On July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA), which regulates the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021, and there is a substantial risk that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by 2021. Vast amounts of loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments are linked to the LIBOR benchmark, and any failure by market participants and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace LIBOR and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of LIBOR could, as noted above, result in disruption in the financial markets, suppress capital markets activities and give rise to litigation claims, all of which could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chases results of operations and on LIBOR-linked securities or other instruments which are issued, funded or held by JPMorgan Chase. Operational JPMorgan Chases businesses are highly dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants. JPMorgan Chases businesses rely comprehensively on the ability of JPMorgan Chases financial, accounting, transaction execution, data processing and other operational systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to proper design, installation, maintenance and training, the effective functioning of JPMorgan Chases operational systems depends on: ##TABLE_START  the quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  JPMorgan Chases ability to appropriately maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are managed carefully to ensure security and operational continuity and adhere to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of its vendors, custodians and other market participants, including clearing and payment systems, CCPs, securities exchanges and data processing, security and technology companies. The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends, including due to a systems malfunction, cyberbreach or other systems failure, could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including: ##TABLE_START  delays or other disruptions in providing information, services and liquidity to clients and customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other assets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the possibility that funds transfers, capital markets trades or other transactions are executed erroneously, illegally or with unintended consequences ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  financial losses, including due to loss-sharing requirements of CCPs, payment systems or other market infrastructures, or as possible restitution to clients and customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  higher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that is unavailable ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  client or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan Chases products and services ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  loss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase, or financial institutions generally, to protect against and withstand operational disruptions, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  harm to JPMorgan Chases reputation. ##TABLE_END As the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continues to increase, it becomes more challenging to effectively maintain and upgrade JPMorgan Chases operational systems and infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that: ##TABLE_START  errors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market participant, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause widespread system disruption ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound, or migrate to other systems over time, to become larger issues ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  failures in synchronization or encryption software, or degraded performance of microprocessors due to design flaws, could cause disruptions in operational systems, or the inability of systems to communicate with each other, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  third parties attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights. ##TABLE_END If JPMorgan Chases operational systems, or those of external parties on which JPMorgan Chases businesses depend, are unable to meet the demanding standards of JPMorgan Chases businesses and operations, or if they fail ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I or have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected. JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms. When JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service, introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services (including mobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing), or makes changes to an existing product, service or delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes. For example, ineffective controls over newly-developed electronic trading platforms could inadvertently permit the rapid build-up of unexpected, abnormal or unusually large positions in securities or other financial instruments, or fail to anticipate or address a downturn in market liquidity which leads to sudden or severe changes in asset prices. Any significant failure to identify and mitigate operational risks associated with new products or services or new platforms for delivering or distributing products or services, or changes to existing products, services or delivery platforms, could diminish JPMorgan Chases ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in: ##TABLE_START  potential liability to clients, counterparties and customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increased operating expenses ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  damage to JPMorgan Chases reputation ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  impairment of JPMorgan Chases liquidity ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regulatory intervention, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  weaker competitive standing. ##TABLE_END Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases businesses and results of operations. JPMorgan Chases connections to external operational systems expose it to greater operational risks. External operational systems with which JPMorgan is connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly connected, but also to a systems breakdown of another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, data aggregators and other external parties with which JPMorgan Chases customers do business can increase JPMorgan Chases operational risk. This is particularly the case where activities of customers or those parties are beyond JPMorgan Chases security and control systems, including through the use of the internet, personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services. If an external party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorgan Chases systems, and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including: ##TABLE_START  heightened risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chases systems ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws and regulations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the external partys security breach, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  harm to reputation arising from the perception that JPMorgan Chases systems may not be secure. ##TABLE_END As JPMorgan Chases interconnectivity with clients, customers and other external parties expands, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to the systems of those parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chases clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information, including restricting the access of customers to their accounts. These actions can increase JPMorgan Chases operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions, central agents, CCPs, payment processors, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially affect JPMorgan Chases ability to conduct business. JPMorgan Chases operations depend on the competence and integrity of its employees and those of external parties. JPMorgan Chases ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably, and to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers, is highly dependent on the competence and trustworthiness of its employees, as well as employees of other parties on which JPMorgan Chases operations rely, including vendors, custodians and financial markets infrastructures. JPMorgan Chases businesses could be materially and adversely affected by a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, fraud or other unlawful conduct, or other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an ##TABLE_START 18   ##TABLE_ENDemployee of JPMorgan Chase or of another party on which JPMorgan Chases operations depend. JPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information. JPMorgan Chases businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. The protected parties can include: ##TABLE_START  JPMorgan Chases clients and customers, and prospective clients and customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  clients and customers of JPMorgan Chases clients and customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  employees and prospective employees, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  employees of JPMorgan Chases vendors, counterparties and other external parties. ##TABLE_END Ensuring that JPMorgan Chases collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can: ##TABLE_START  increase JPMorgan Chases compliance and operating costs ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  hinder the development of new products or services, curtail the offering of existing products or services, or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chases management, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  require JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. ##TABLE_END Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase cannot ensure that all of its clients and customers, vendors, counterparties and other external parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if personal, confidential or proprietary information of clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused, such as situations where such information is: ##TABLE_START  erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties. ##TABLE_END Concerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chases measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chases revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan Chases reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses. Recent, well-publicized allegations involving the misuse or inappropriate sharing of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the safeguarding of personal information and the use or sharing of personal data by companies in the U.S. and other countries. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws and regulations relating to the use and sharing of personal information. These types of laws and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, and thereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict JPMorgan Chases use of personal data when developing or offering products or services to customers. These restrictions could inhibit JPMorgan Chases development or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers. A successful cyberattack against JPMorgan Chase could cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase experiences numerous cyberattacks on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets on a daily basis. These cyberattacks can take many forms, but a common objective of many of these attacks is to introduce computer viruses or malware into JPMorgan Chases systems. These viruses or malicious code are typically designed to: ##TABLE_START  obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or employees ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  manipulate or destroy data ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan Chases systems, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  steal money. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase has also experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks which are intended to disrupt online banking services. JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems to protect them against cyberattacks. However, JPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to cyberattacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers. ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I A principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide absolute security against cyberattacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chases systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches. This is because: ##TABLE_START  the techniques used in cyberattacks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries, or whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  third parties may seek to gain access to JPMorgan Chases systems either directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of JPMorgan Chases systems. ##TABLE_END The risk of a security breach due to a cyberattack could increase in the future as JPMorgan Chase continues to expand its mobile-payments and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of JPMorgan Chases systems or the systems of a vendor, governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences, including: ##TABLE_START  significant disruption of JPMorgan Chases operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational systems ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  misappropriation of confidential information of JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers, counterparties, employees or regulators ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  damage to computers or systems of JPMorgan Chase and those of its clients, customers and counterparties ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inability to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other laws ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients, customers, counterparties or employees ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chases cybersecurity measures ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chases clients, customers or counterparties ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  harm to JPMorgan Chases reputation. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase could also suffer some of the above consequences if a third party were to misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan Chases employees. JPMorgan Chase may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a security breach due to a cyberattack. A successful breach of JPMorgan Chases computer systems, software, networks or other technology assets due to a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected due to: ##TABLE_START  the breadth of JPMorgan Chases operations and the high volume of transactions that it processes ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the large number of customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which JPMorgan Chase does business ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the proliferation and increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the possibility that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems. ##TABLE_END The extent of a particular cyberattack and the steps that JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. While such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyberattack, and that damage may continue to spread. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyberattack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack. JPMorgan Chases operations, results and reputation could be harmed by catastrophes or other events. JPMorgan Chases business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could be harmed, by events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, including: ##TABLE_START  cyberbreaches or breaches of physical premises, including data centers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  power, telecommunications or internet outages ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  failures of, or loss of access to, operational systems, including computer systems, servers, networks and other technology assets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  damage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan Chase or third parties, and any consequent injuries, including in connection with any construction projects undertaken by JPMorgan Chase ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  natural disasters or severe weather conditions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 20   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  health emergencies or pandemics, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase maintains a firm-wide resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure the ability to recover critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chases resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers. Furthermore, should emergency or catastrophic events such as severe or abnormal weather conditions become more chronic, the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chases business and operations, and on its clients, customers, counterparties and employees, could become more significant and long-lasting. Any significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chases operations or operational systems, or any catastrophic event, could: ##TABLE_START  hinder JPMorgan Chases ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its counterparties ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  cause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  harm its reputation. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chases risk management framework and procedures may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chases risk management framework is intended to mitigate risk and loss. The framework includes both the first line of defense, consisting of each line of business and Treasury and the Chief Investment Office, including their aligned Operations, Technology and Control Management groups, and the second line of defense, consisting of Independent Risk Management. JPMorgan Chase has established processes and procedures to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject. However, there are inherent limitations to risk management strategies because there may be existing or future risks that JPMorgan Chase has not appropriately anticipated or identified. Any inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chases risk management framework, governance structure, procedures and practices, models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses, and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any such inadequacy or lapse could: ##TABLE_START  require significant resources to remediate ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  attract heightened regulatory scrutiny ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expose JPMorgan Chase to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  subject it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  harm its reputation, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of JPMorgan Chases data gathering and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting. JPMorgan Chase establishes allowances for probable credit losses that are inherent in its credit exposures. It then employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to JPMorgan Chases results of operations and financial condition. They require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of JPMorgan Chases borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. It is possible that JPMorgan Chase will fail to identify the proper factors or that it will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies. Many of JPMorgan Chases risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior. These strategies and techniques are based to some degree on managements subjective judgment. For example, many models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated. Conversely, previously-correlated indicators may make unrelated movements at those times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements could, in some circumstances, limit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chases risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses. JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses, its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models or estimations prove to be inadequate. JPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations to assess and implement mitigating controls over its market, credit, liquidity, operational and other risks. These models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective in all cases to ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as: ##TABLE_START  reliance on historical trends that may not accurately predict future events, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations which predict correlation among certain market indicators or asset prices ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  historical trend information may be incomplete, or may not anticipate severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  models and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations. ##TABLE_END Some of the models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorgan Chases regulators. These reviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and estimations in connection with calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan Chases models or estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses. JPMorgan Chases capital actions could also be constrained if a CCAR submission is not approved by its banking regulators due to the perceived inadequacy of its models or estimations. Enhanced standards for vendor risk management can result in higher costs and other potential exposures. JPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with doing business with vendors and other third-party service providers. These requirements are contained both in bank regulatory regulations and guidance and in certain consent orders to which JPMorgan Chase has been subject. JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships. JPMorgan Chases failure to appropriately assess and manage third-party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could materially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could result in: ##TABLE_START  potential liability to clients and customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increased operational costs, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  harm to JPMorgan Chases reputation. ##TABLE_END Requirements for physical settlement and delivery in trading agreements could expose JPMorgan Chase to operational and other risks. Certain of JPMorgan Chases markets transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that JPMorgan Chase does not own. If JPMorgan Chase is unable to obtain the obligations within the required timeframe, JPMorgan Chase could forfeit payments otherwise due. Failures could also result in settlement delays, which could damage JPMorgan Chases reputation and ability to transact business. Failure to timely settle and confirm transactions could also subject JPMorgan Chase to heightened credit and operational risk, and losses in the event of a default. JPMorgan Chase could incur unexpected losses if estimates and judgments underlying its financial statements are incorrect. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), JPMorgan Chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation. Certain financial instruments require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare JPMorgan Chases financial statements, including: ##TABLE_START  trading assets and liabilities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  instruments in the investment securities portfolio ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  certain loans ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  MSRs ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  structured notes, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  certain repurchase and resale agreements. ##TABLE_END Where quoted market prices are not available for these types of financial instruments, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. Sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments, which could lead to valuations being subsequently changed or adjusted. If estimates or judgments underlying JPMorgan Chases financial statements prove to have been incorrect, JPMorgan Chase may experience material losses. Lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chases profitability or reputation. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chases disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could: ##TABLE_START 22   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases business and results of operations or financial condition ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  restrict its ability to access the capital markets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  require it to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  harm its reputation, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  otherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan Chase. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or policies. The preparation of JPMorgan Chases financial statements is based on accounting standards established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as more detailed accounting policies established by JPMorgan Chases management. From time to time these accounting standards or accounting policies may change, and in some cases these changes could have a material effect on JPMorgan Chases financial statements and may adversely affect its financial results or investor perceptions of those results. For example, on January 1, 2020, JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. companies will be required to implement a new accounting standard, commonly referred to as the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) framework, which will require earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments, replacing the incurred loss model that is currently in use. JPMorgan Chase expects that under CECL, it will need to, among other things, increase the allowance for credit losses related to its loans and other lending-related commitments, which may have a negative impact on its capital levels. This new accounting standard may result in greater volatility of JPMorgan Chases earnings and capital levels over economic cycles and could potentially affect JPMorgan Chases capital distribution plans, depending upon final guidance from the regulators. In addition, JPMorgan Chase could be adversely impacted by associated changes in the competitive environment in which it operates, including changes in the availability or pricing of loan products, particularly during periods of economic stress, as well as changes related to non-U.S. financial institutions or other competitors that are not subject to this new accounting standard. Strategic If JPMorgan Chases management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies, and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies, JPMorgan Chases competitive standing and results could suffer. JPMorgan Chases business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and results of operations. These strategies relate to: ##TABLE_START  the products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the geographies in which it operates ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the types of clients and customers that it serves ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the counterparties with which it does business, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services. ##TABLE_END If management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect, do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments, then the franchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan Chases businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline. JPMorgan Chases growth and prospects also depend on managements ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in the near term and over longer time horizons. Managements effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chases ability to develop and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to shareholders. Each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to: ##TABLE_START  devise effective business plans and strategies ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  effectively implement business decisions, including minimizing bureaucratic processes ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  institute controls that appropriately address the risks associated with business activities and any changes in those activities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  offer products and services that are appropriately priced, meet the changing expectations of clients and customers and are delivered in ways that enhance client and customer satisfaction ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term stability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise modeling or subjective judgments made in connection with those allocations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  adequately respond to regulatory requirements ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  appropriately address shareholder concerns ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I ##TABLE_START  react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  develop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage JPMorgan Chases businesses. ##TABLE_END Additionally, JPMorgan Chases Board of Directors plays an important role in exercising appropriate oversight of managements strategic decisions, and a failure by the Board to perform this function could also impair JPMorgan Chases results of operations. Conduct Conduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm clients and customers, impact market integrity, damage JPMorgan Chases reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action. JPMorgan Chases employees interact with clients, customers and counterparties, and with each other, every day. All employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan Chases How We Do Business Principles, including JPMorgan Chases commitment to do first class business in a first class way. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an employees life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance management. Conduct risk management is also an integral component of JPMorgan Chases promotion and compensation processes. Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, certain employees have in the past engaged in improper or illegal conduct, and these instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation as well as resolutions of governmental investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. There is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions by employees will not occur or that any such actions will always be detected, deterred or prevented. JPMorgan Chases reputation could be harmed, and collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one or more employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chases expectations, policies and practices, including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, other market participants or other employees. Some examples of this include: ##TABLE_START  improperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chases products or services ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorized trading ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  facilitating illegal or aggressive tax-motivated transactions, or transactions designed to circumvent economic sanction programs ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  violating anti-trust or anti-competition laws by colluding with other market participants to manipulate markets, prices or indices ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  making risk decisions in ways that subordinate JPMorgan Chases risk appetite to employee compensation objectives, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  misappropriating property, confidential or proprietary information, or technology assets belonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third parties. ##TABLE_END The consequences of any failure by employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chases expectations, policies or practices could include litigation, or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, or lead to: ##TABLE_START  financial losses ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increased operational and compliance costs ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  greater regulatory scrutiny ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chases management ##TABLE_END loss of clients or customers, and ##TABLE_START  harm to JPMorgan Chases reputation. ##TABLE_END Reputation Damage to JPMorgan Chases reputation could harm its businesses. Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chases reputation can therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chases business and prospects. Harm to JPMorgan Chases reputation can arise from numerous sources, including: ##TABLE_START  employee misconduct, including discriminatory behavior or harassment ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  security breaches, including cyberattacks ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  failure to safeguard client or customer information ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  not appropriately managing social and environmental risk issues associated with its business activities or those of its clients ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance or operational failures ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or resolutions of these matters. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 24   ##TABLE_ENDJPMorgan Chases reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of certain third parties to comply with laws or regulations, including companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors and other third parties with which JPMorgan Chase does business. JPMorgan Chases reputation or prospects may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet, and this risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels. Social and environmental activists are increasingly targeting financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase with public criticism for their relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, including businesses whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to the health of consumers, or whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment, workers rights or communities. Activists have also engaged in public protests at JPMorgan Chases headquarters and other properties. Activist criticism of JPMorgan Chases relationships with clients in sensitive industries could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients, customers, investors and employees with how JPMorgan Chase addresses social and environmental concerns in its business activities. Alternatively, yielding to activism targeted at certain sensitive industries could damage JPMorgan Chases relationships with clients and customers, and with governmental bodies in jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does business, whose views are not aligned with those of social and environmental activists. In either case, the resulting harm to JPMorgan Chases reputation could: ##TABLE_START  cause certain clients and customers to cease doing business with JPMorgan Chase ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  impair JPMorgan Chases ability to attract new clients and customers, or to expand its relationships with existing clients and customers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  diminish JPMorgan Chases ability to hire or retain employees, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  prompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with certain clients. ##TABLE_END Any of the above factors could negatively affect JPMorgan Chases results of operations and its ability to maintain its competitive standing. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chases reputation. For example, concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution, or that a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers, can damage the reputation of the industry as a whole. If JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors, the measures needed to address the associated reputational issues could increase JPMorgan Chases operational and compliance costs and negatively affect its earnings. Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest can result in litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage JPMorgan Chases reputation. JPMorgan Chases ability to manage potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as its business activities encompass more transactions, obligations and interests with and among JPMorgan Chases clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions, and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to: ##TABLE_START  adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  deliver appropriate standards of service and quality ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  treat clients and customers with the appropriate standard of care ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  use client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations. ##TABLE_END In the future, a failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chases reputation. Country Adverse economic and political developments in a country or region, or globally, can have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chases businesses. JPMorgan Chases businesses and earnings can be affected by the monetary, fiscal and other policies adopted by regulatory authorities and agencies in the countries in which JPMorgan Chase operates. Changes in fiscal policies by central banks or regulatory authorities, and the manner in which those policies are executed, are beyond JPMorgan Chases control and may be difficult to predict. Consequently, unanticipated changes in these policies or the ways in which they are implemented could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chases businesses and results of operations. Some countries or regions in which JPMorgan Chase operates or invests, or in which JPMorgan Chase may do business in the future, have in the past experienced severe ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. Concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries, or the possibility that a particular country may decide to depart from a trade, monetary or political pact, can result in a deterioration of economic and market conditions within the affected countries or regions, including: ##TABLE_START  slowing growth rates, rising inflation or recessionary economic conditions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a contraction of available credit ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  diminished investor and consumer confidence, including loss of confidence in local banking systems ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increased market volatility ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reduced commercial activity among trading partners, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the potential for currency redenomination or the dissolution of a political or economic alliance or treaty. ##TABLE_END Any or all of these factors could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chases business and results of operations in the affected country or region. These developments can also lead to a contagion which causes similar conditions to arise in other countries in the same region or beyond. Furthermore, governments in particular countries or regions in which JPMorgan Chase or its clients do business may choose to adopt protectionist economic or trade policies in response to concerns about domestic economic conditions or as countermeasures to policies or actions taken by other countries or regions. Any or all of these developments could lead to diminished cross-border trade and financing activity within that country or region, all of which could negatively affect JPMorgan Chases business and earnings in those jurisdictions and increase its operational costs. If JPMorgan Chase takes steps to reduce its market and credit risk exposure within a particular country or region that is experiencing economic or political disruption, it may incur losses that are higher than expected because it will be disposing of assets when market conditions are likely to be highly unfavorable. An outbreak of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on JPMorgan Chases businesses within the affected region or globally. Aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, including armed conflict or intensified cyberattacks, could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into full-scale war with potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on the scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in: ##TABLE_START  worldwide economic disruption ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  heightened volatility in financial markets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  severe declines in asset values, accompanied by widespread sell-offs of investments ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  substantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  disruption of global trade, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  diminished consumer, business and investor confidence. ##TABLE_END Any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on JPMorgan Chases operations and earnings, both in the countries or region directly affected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to become directly involved in such a conflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that JPMorgan Chase may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in any nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. JPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyberattacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict. JPMorgan Chases business activities with governmental entities can pose an enhanced risk of loss. Several of JPMorgan Chases businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, both within and outside the U.S. These activities can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputation risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may: ##TABLE_START  default on or restructure its obligations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government. ##TABLE_END Any or all of these actions could adversely affect JPMorgan Chases financial condition and results of operations and could hurt its reputation, particularly if JPMorgan Chase pursues claims against a government obligor in a jurisdiction in which it has significant business relationships with clients or customers. JPMorgan Chases business and revenues in emerging markets can be hampered by local economic, political, regulatory and social factors. Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the U.S. and other developed markets in which JPMorgan Chase operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including: ##TABLE_START  extreme currency fluctuations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 26   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  high inflation ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  low or negative growth, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt. ##TABLE_END The governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment, including: ##TABLE_START  price, capital or exchange controls, including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property, including intellectual property, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in laws and regulations. ##TABLE_END The impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than more-developed markets. These types of government actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chases operations in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multi-national clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction. For example, some or all of these governmental actions can result in funds belonging to JPMorgan Chase, or that it places with a local custodian on behalf of a client, being effectively trapped in a country. In addition to the ultimate risk of losing the funds entirely, JPMorgan Chase could be exposed for an extended period of time to the credit risk of a local custodian that is now operating in a deteriorating domestic economy. In addition, emerging markets countries, as well as certain more developed countries, have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions and related governmental actions, including: ##TABLE_START  social unrest ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  general strikes and demonstrations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  crime and corruption ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  security and personal safety issues ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  outbreaks of hostilities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  overthrow of incumbent governments ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  terrorist attacks, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other forms of internal discord. ##TABLE_END These economic, political, regulatory and social developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future could lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan Chases operations in those countries and impair the revenues, growth and profitability of those operations. In addition, any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan Chases operations and investments in another country or countries, including in the U.S. Competition The financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chases results of operations will suffer if it is not a strong, effective and forward-looking competitor. JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment and expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors include: ##TABLE_START  other banks and financial institutions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  trading, advisory and investment management firms ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  finance companies and technology companies, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services. ##TABLE_END JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations. New competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other services could be significantly disrupted by technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. In addition, new technologies may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan Chases costs for complying with laws and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns from providing products and services through those new technologies. Ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for JPMorgan Chases products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products such as deposits and bank accounts. This competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chases businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service, changes in client and customer expectations or other ##TABLE_START   ##TABLE_ENDPart I factors, could affect JPMorgan Chases ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chases revenues. Increased competition also may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive. Non-U.S. competitors of JPMorgan Chases wholesale businesses outside the U.S. are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. The more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial services institutions can put JPMorgan Chase and those firms at a competitive disadvantage to non-U.S. competitors. This could reduce the revenue and profitability of JPMorgan Chases wholesale businesses, resulting from: ##TABLE_START  prohibitions on engaging in certain transactions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  higher capital and liquidity requirements ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  making JPMorgan Chases pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  adversely affecting JPMorgan Chases cost structure for providing certain products. ##TABLE_END People JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success. JPMorgan Chases employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer or members of the Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chases performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected. Unfavorable changes in immigration policies could adversely affect the quality of JPMorgan Chases businesses and operations. JPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world. Changes in immigration policies in the U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to make structural changes to its worldwide operating model that are less efficient or more costly. Legal JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from private actions and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations. JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations. Regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chases businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions. If another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by JPMorgan Chase. These and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services. All of these potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chases reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chases profitability, or result in collateral consequences. In addition, the extent of JPMorgan Chases exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established for those matters.

The internal control framework promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), Internal Control  Integrated Framework (COSO 2013), provides guidance for designing, implementing and conducting internal control and assessing its effectiveness.

Refer to Managements report on internal control over financial reporting on page 148 . As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firms management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
