Business ##TABLE_END General NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1968 under the laws of the state of Oregon. As used in this report, the terms we, us, NIKE and the Company refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our Internet address is www.nike.com. On our NIKE Corporate web site, located at www.nikebiz.com, we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission: our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All such filings on our NIKE Corporate web site are available free of charge. Also available on the NIKE Corporate web site are the charters of the committees of our board of directors, as well as our corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics; copies of any of these documents will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing of high quality footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessory products. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail including stores and internet sales, and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees, in over 170 countries around the world. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Virtually all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment products are produced both in the United States and abroad. Products NIKEs athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on high quality construction and innovation in products designed for men, women and children. Running, training, basketball, soccer, sport-inspired casual shoes, and kids shoes are currently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in product sales in the near future. We also market footwear designed for aquatic activities, baseball, cheerleading, football, golf, lacrosse, outdoor activities, skateboarding, tennis, volleyball, walking, wrestling, and other athletic and recreational uses. We sell sports apparel and accessories covering most of the above categories, sports-inspired lifestyle apparel, as well as athletic bags and accessory items. NIKE apparel and accessories feature the same trademarks and are sold through the same marketing and distribution channels. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in collections of similar design or for specific purposes. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos. We sell a line of performance equipment under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, electronic devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment, golf clubs, and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc. In addition to the products we sell directly to customers, we have entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell certain apparel, electronic devices and other equipment designed for sports activities. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cole Haan (Cole Haan), headquartered in Yarmouth, Maine, designs and distributes dress and casual footwear, apparel and accessories for men and women under the Cole Haan  trademark.  Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Converse Inc. (Converse), headquartered in North Andover, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories under the Converse  , Chuck Taylor  , All Star  , One Star  , Star Chevron and Jack Purcell  trademarks. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hurley International LLC (Hurley), headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the Hurley  trademark. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Umbro Ltd. (Umbro), headquartered in Cheadle, England, designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and equipment, primarily for the sport of football (soccer), under the Umbro  trademark. Sales and Marketing Financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in Note 19 of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 88. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment. Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. We must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, production, marketing and selling of sports and fitness footwear, apparel, and equipment. In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we initiated a reorganization of the NIKE Brand into a new model consisting of six geographies. Effective June 1, 2009, we began operating under our new organizational structure for the NIKE Brand, which consists of the following geographies: North America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Previously, NIKE Brand operations were organized into the following four geographic regions: U.S.; Europe; Middle East and Africa (collectively, EMEA); Asia Pacific; and Americas. United States Market In fiscal 2010 and 2009, sales in the United States including U.S. sales of our Other Businesses accounted for approximately 42% of total revenues, compared to 43% in fiscal 2008. For fiscal 2010 and 2009, our Other Businesses were primarily comprised of Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, NIKE Golf and Umbro (which was acquired on March 3, 2008). For fiscal 2008, our Other Businesses were primarily comprised of Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter (whose primary business was the Starter brand business which was sold on December 17, 2007), Hurley, NIKE Bauer Hockey (which was sold on April 17, 2008), NIKE Golf and Umbro. We estimate that we sell to more than 23,000 retail accounts in the United States. The NIKE Brand domestic retail account base includes a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops, and other retail accounts. During fiscal 2010, our three largest customers accounted for approximately 24% of sales in the United States. We make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time  period at a fixed price. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, 89% of our U.S. wholesale footwear shipments (excluding our Other Businesses) were made under the futures program, compared to 90% in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2010, 62% of our U.S. wholesale apparel shipments (excluding our Other Businesses) were made under the futures program, compared to 60% in fiscal 2009 and 62% in fiscal 2008. We utilize 19 NIKE sales offices to solicit sales in the United States. We also utilize 4 independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf and 5 for skateboarding and outdoor products. In addition, we sell NIKE Brand products through our internet website, www.nikestore.com , and we operate the following retail outlets in the United States: ##TABLE_START U.S. Retail Stores  Number NIKE factory stores (which carry primarily overstock and close-out merchandise)  145 NIKE stores (including one NIKE Women store)  12 NIKETOWNs (designed to showcase NIKE products)  11 NIKE employee-only stores  3 Cole Haan stores (including factory stores)  106 Converse factory stores  51 Hurley stores (including factory and employee stores)  18   Total  346   ##TABLE_END NIKEs three United States distribution centers for NIKE Brand footwear are located in Memphis, Tennessee. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment products are shipped from our Memphis, Tennessee and Foothill Ranch, California distribution centers. Cole Haan products are distributed primarily from Greenland, New Hampshire, Converse products are shipped primarily from Ontario, California, and Hurley products are distributed from Irvine, California. International Markets In fiscal 2010 and 2009, non-U.S. sales (including non-U.S. sales of our Other Businesses) accounted for 58% of total revenues, compared to 57% in fiscal 2008. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores, and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees around the world. We estimate that we sell to more than 24,000 retail accounts outside the United States, excluding sales by independent distributors and licensees. We operate 14 distribution centers outside of the United States. In many countries and regions, including Canada, Asia, some Latin American countries, and Europe, we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the United States futures program described above. During fiscal 2010, NIKEs three largest customers outside of the U.S. accounted for approximately 8% of total non-U.S. sales. We operate the following retail outlets outside the United States: ##TABLE_START Non-U.S. Retail Stores  Number NIKE factory stores  205 NIKE stores  55 NIKETOWNs  2 NIKE employee-only stores  12 Cole Haan stores  68 Hurley stores  1   Total  343   ##TABLE_END International branch offices and subsidiaries of NIKE are located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France,  Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Lebanon, Macau, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and Vietnam. Significant Customer No customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales during fiscal 2010. Orders Worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from June through November 2010, were $8.8 billion compared to $7.8 billion for the same period last year. This futures and advance order amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period, which approximate current spot rates. Reported futures and advance orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders and the fulfillment of certain of these advance/futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE footwear and apparel, wholesale sales of equipment, Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, Umbro, NIKE Golf, and certain retail sales across all brands. Product Research and Development We believe our research and development efforts are a key factor in our past and future success. Technical innovation in the design of footwear, apparel, and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as NIKE strives to produce products that help to reduce injury, enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort. In addition to NIKEs own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, and other experts who consult with us and review designs, materials, and concepts for product improvement. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process. Manufacturing Virtually all of our footwear is produced by factories we contract with outside of the United States. In fiscal 2010, contract factories in Vietnam, China, Indonesia, Thailand, and India manufactured approximately 37%, 34%, 23%, 2% and 1% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. We also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in Argentina, Brazil, India, and Mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. The largest single footwear factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 5% of total fiscal 2010 footwear production. Almost all of NIKE Brand apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers located in 33 countries. Most of this apparel production occurred in China, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Cambodia, El Salvador, Mexico, and Taiwan. The largest single apparel factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 7% of total fiscal 2010 apparel production. The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, nylon, leather, canvas, and polyurethane films used to make Air-Sole cushioning  components. During fiscal 2010, NIKE IHM, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NIKE, and independent contractors in China and Taiwan, were our largest suppliers of the Air-Sole cushioning components used in footwear. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, plastic and metal hardware, and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain, retain heat, or efficiently transport body moisture. NIKEs contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk. Most raw materials are available in the countries where manufacturing takes place. We have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements. Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America), a large Japanese trading company, has performed significant import-export financing services for us. During fiscal 2010, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Brazil, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, South Africa, China, Korea, and Thailand, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 17% of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the United States, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Japan. Such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates. Our current agreements with Sojitz America expire on May 31, 2011. International Operations and Trade Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as possible revaluation of currencies, export and import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring. The current global economic recession has resulted in a significant slow down in international trade and a sharp rise in protectionist actions around the world. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionist challenges in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together to address trade issues to reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, such actions, if implemented, could result in increases in the cost of our products, which could adversely affect our sales or profitability and the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole. Accordingly, we are actively monitoring the developments described below. Footwear Imports into the European Union In 2005, at the request of the European domestic footwear industry, the European Commission (EC) initiated investigations into leather footwear imported from China and Vietnam. Together with other companies in our industry, we took the position that Special Technology Athletic Footwear (STAF) (i) should not be within the scope of the investigation, and (ii) does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an anti-dumping investigation. Our arguments were successful and the EU agreed in October 2006 on definitive duties of 16.5% for China and 10% for Vietnam for non-STAF leather footwear, but excluded STAF from the final measures. Prior to the scheduled expiration in October 2008 of the measures imposed on the non-STAF footwear, the domestic industry requested and the EC agreed to review a petition to extend these restrictions on non-STAF leather footwear. In December 2009, following a review of the ongoing restrictions, EU member states voted to extend the measures for an additional 15 months, until March 31, 2011. We expect that a decision by the EC on whether to initiate a review on these measures for a second time will take place before the end of calendar 2010.  On February 3, 2010, the Chinese government announced it would be seeking to refer the EU decision (both on the original measures and subsequent review decision) to the World Trade Organization (WTO), and on May 18, 2010, the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO agreed to establish a panel to rule on Chinas claims against the EU with respect to current anti-dumping measures in force for leather footwear exports. Footwear Imports into Brazil and Argentina At the request of certain domestic footwear industry participants, both Brazil and Argentina have initiated independent anti-dumping investigations against footwear made in China. Over the last two years, we have been working in broad coalition with other companies in our industry to challenge these cases on the basis that the athletic footwear being imported from China (i) should not be within the scope of the investigation, and (ii) does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an anti-dumping investigation. In the case of Argentina, in 2010, the final determination made by the administering authorities was favorable to us. In the case of Brazil, the administering authorities agreed to impose an anti-dumping duty against nearly all footwear from China, which we believe will impact all brands in the footwear industry. Although we do not currently expect that this decision will materially affect us, we are working with the same broad coalition of footwear companies to challenge this decision in domestic Brazilian courts as well as international forums such as the WTO. Footwear Imports into Turkey In 2006, Turkey introduced safeguard measures in the form of additional duties on all imported footwear into Turkey with the goal of protecting its local shoe manufacturing industry until August 2009. In June 2009, Turkish shoe-manufacturers submitted, and the Turkish Government agreed to review, a request for extension of the safeguard measures claiming that the rehabilitation process of the local Turkish industry was interrupted due to the continuing increase of footwear imports. Despite the importers opposition to the continuation of the safeguard measures, the Turkish authorities extended these safeguard measures until August 2012, but reduced the duty from $3 per pair of footwear to $1.60 per pair of footwear. As a result of this decision, Vietnam and Indonesia each initiated discussions with Turkey and each is seeking compensation from Turkey, which is possible under current WTO rules. These bilateral discussions are currently ongoing, and one potential outcome could involve Turkey awarding trade concessions on other products  or the exclusion from the safeguard measure of certain categories of footwear. A conclusion of the first round of talks between the exporting countries is expected in September 2010. Trade Relations with China China represents an important sourcing and marketing country for us. Many governments around the world are concerned about Chinas growing and fast-paced economy, compliance with WTO rules, currency valuation, and high trade surpluses. As a result, a wide range of legislative proposals have been introduced to address these concerns. While some of these concerns may be justified, we are working with broad coalitions of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors (e.g., services, manufacturing, and agriculture) to help ensure any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules, and (iii) reflects and considers Chinas domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community. We believe other companies in our industry as well as most other multi-national companies are in a similar position regarding these trade measures. In the event any of these trade protection measures are implemented, we believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature. We believe our principal competitors are subject to similar risks.  Competition The athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the United States and on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes, apparel, and equipment, including Adidas, Puma, and others. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world. Performance and reliability of shoes, apparel, and equipment, new product development, price, product identity through marketing and promotion, and customer support and service are important aspects of competition in the athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry. To help market our products, we contract with prominent and influential athletes, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our products, and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics. We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas. Trademarks and Patents We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE  and Swoosh Design  trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 150 countries. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement. NIKE has an exclusive, worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented Air technology. The process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane. Some of the early NIKE AIR  patents have expired, which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology. Subsequent NIKE AIR  patents will not expire for several years. We also have hundreds of U.S. and foreign utility patents, and thousands of U.S. and foreign design patents covering components and features used in various athletic and leisure shoes, apparel, and equipment. These patents expire at various times, and patents issued for applications filed this year will last from now to 2024 for design patents, and from now to 2030 for utility patents. We believe our success depends primarily upon skills in design, research and development, production, and marketing rather than upon our patent position. However, we have followed a policy of filing applications for United States and foreign patents on inventions, designs, and improvements that we deem valuable. Employees We had approximately 34,400 employees at May 31, 2010. Management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent. None of our employees is represented by a union, except for certain employees in the Emerging Markets geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union, and in the United States, where certain employees of Cole Haan are represented by a union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require representation for employees by works councils (such as in certain countries in the European Union, in which they are entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or other employee representation by an organization similar to a union, and in certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into and/or comply with (industry wide or national) collective bargaining agreements. There has never been a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements.

The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include, among others, the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and  growth of the overall athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products, and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products; difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for NIKE products, and the various market factors described above; difficulties in implementing, operating, and maintaining NIKEs increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning, and inventory control; interruptions in data and communications systems; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance futures orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes in shipment timing, and the changing mix of futures and at-once orders and order cancellations; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKEs products; increases in the cost of materials and energy used to manufacture products, new product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property; performance and reliability of products; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors and licensees; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in our debt ratings; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas, political and economic instability, and terrorism; changes in government regulations; the impact of, including business and legal developments relating to, climate change; liability and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKEs business and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKEs business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKEs policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE. Our products face intense competition. NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. The athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the United States and on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes, apparel, and equipment. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products and for import quota capacity. Our competitors product offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, and customer service are areas of intense competition. This, in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for  athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly. If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profits. Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports apparel or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories and lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We rely on technical innovation and high quality products to compete in the market for our products. Although design and aesthetics of our products appear to be the most important factor for consumer acceptance of our products, technical innovation and quality control in the design of footwear, apparel, and athletic equipment is also essential to the commercial success of our products. Research and development plays a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to reduce injury, enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. Failure to continue to obtain high quality endorsers of our products could harm our business. We establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues to evaluate, promote, and establish product authenticity with consumers. If certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues could also harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products, or a failure to enter into cost effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sales of our products. Failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct, local laws, and other standards could harm our business. We contract with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to manufacture our products, and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract to manufacture products using our trademarks. We impose, and require our licensees to impose, on those contractors a code of conduct and other environmental, health, and safety standards for the benefit of workers. However, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may not require their contractors to comply with such standards or applicable local law. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition.  Global capital and credit market conditions, and resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Continuing volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets have led to a tightening of business credit and liquidity, a contraction of consumer credit, business failures, higher unemployment, and declines in consumer confidence and spending in the United States and internationally. If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate or remain weak for an extended period of time, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition: ##TABLE_START    Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, increased inventories, and lower gross margins. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    We may be unable to find suitable investments that are safe, liquid, and provide a reasonable return. This could result in lower interest income or longer investment horizons. Disruptions to capital markets or the banking system may also impair the value of investments or bank deposits we currently consider safe or liquid. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    We may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The failure of financial institution counterparties to honor their obligations to us under credit and derivative instruments could jeopardize our ability to rely on and benefit from those instruments. Our ability to replace those instruments on the same or similar terms may be limited under poor market conditions. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    We conduct transactions in various currencies, which increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported financial results and condition. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Continued volatility in the markets and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as petroleum) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins, and profitability. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    If retailers of our products experience declining revenues, or retailers experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, inability of retailers to timely meet their payment obligations to us, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts, and increased bad debt expense. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could reduce the availability of our products to consumers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products. ##TABLE_END Our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results and stock price. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to  fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, availability of import quotas and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including shifts in product sales mix, geographic sales trends, and currency exchange rate fluctuations, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues. We make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price. Our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory, purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders, and the risk of non-delivery. We report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports. Although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues, reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of changes in revenues for any future period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, returns, and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including at-once close-out sales of NIKE footwear and apparel, wholesale sales of equipment, Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, NIKE Golf and Umbro, and retail sales across all brands. Our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins and harm to our business. We purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, and diminish brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance. We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers. We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products, we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be cancelled, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties, which have had an adverse effect on our business. As a result, retailers may be more cautious than usual with orders as a result of weakness in the retail economy. A slowing economy in our key markets could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers who experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products.  Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk, and impair our ability to sell our products. The athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment retailers with many stores. These retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. These situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity, it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. In addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business. We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying us, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE  and Swoosh Design  trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 150 countries. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We believe that our trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success, and our competitive position. We periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in challenging a partys products on the basis of trademark or design or utility patent infringement, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products. The actions we take to establish and protect trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources. From time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business. Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments, and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products. In  addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets, and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs, or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion. Recently proposed legislation in the United States would change how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on their foreign income. If such legislation is enacted, it may have a material adverse impact to our tax rate and in turn, our profitability. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in higher costs and decreased margins. A majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. As a result, we conduct transactions in various currencies, which increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. dollars for consolidated financial reporting. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our hedging activities (see Note 18  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ), which are designed to minimize and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently mitigate the impact of foreign currencies on our financial results. Factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts, volatility of currency markets, and the availability of hedging instruments. Since the hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities. Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing, and financing. The principal materials used in our apparel products  natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, plastic and metal hardware, and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain, retain heat, or efficiently transport body moisture  are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. The principal materials used in our footwear products  natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, nylon, leather, canvas and polyurethane films  are also locally available to manufacturers. NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk.  There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. In addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, quality control standards, and labor, health and safety standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long-term. Because independent manufacturers manufacture a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers, could adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our profit margins. The cost of fuel is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins. In addition, Sojitz America performs significant import-export financing services for most of the NIKE Brand products sold outside of the United States, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Japan, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the United States, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Japan. Such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. Our success depends on our global distribution facilities. We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities, and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse affect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities. We rely significantly on information technology in our supply chain, and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. We are heavily dependent on information technology systems across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and distribution. Our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these supply chain systems. Over the last several years, as part of the ongoing initiative to upgrade our worldwide supply chain, we have implemented new systems in all of our geographical regions in which we operate. Over the next few years, we will work to continue to enhance the systems and  related processes in our global operations. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. From time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, acquisitions of new businesses, and expansion of existing businesses, such as our retail operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. However, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in acquiring or expanding a business. The failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or profitability we expect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business. Our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of any key individual could harm us. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. The sale of a large number of shares held by our Chairman could depress the market price of our common stock. Philip H. Knight, Co-founder and Chairman of our Board of Directors, beneficially owns over 74% of our Class A Common Stock. If all of his Class A Common Stock were converted into Class B Common Stock, Mr. Knight would own over 14% of our Class B Common Stock. These shares are available for resale, subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws. The sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock. There are provisions of our articles of incorporation and Oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, a freezeout statute, two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-fourths of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company. We may fail to meet analyst expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline. Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts estimates of our future performance. The analysts estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.  ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments ##TABLE_END Not applicable. ##TABLE_START ", "2": " Item 2.  Properties ##TABLE_END The following is a summary of principal properties owned or leased by NIKE. The NIKE World Campus, owned by NIKE and located in Beaverton, Oregon, USA, is a 176 acre facility of 18 buildings which functions as our world headquarters and is occupied by almost 5,800 employees engaged in management, research, design, development, marketing, finance, and other administrative functions from nearly all of our divisions. We also lease various office facilities in the surrounding metropolitan area. We lease a similar, but smaller, administrative facility in Hilversum, the Netherlands, which serves as the headquarters for the Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe geographies. There are three significant distribution and customer service facilities for NIKE Brand footwear products in the United States. All three of them are located in Memphis, Tennessee, one of which is leased. In the United States, NIKE Brand apparel and equipment are shipped from our Memphis, Tennessee and Foothill Ranch, California distribution centers, which we lease. Cole Haan also operates a distribution facility in Greenland, New Hampshire, which we lease. Smaller leased distribution facilities for other brands and non-NIKE Brand businesses are located in various parts of the United States. We also own or lease distribution and customer service facilities in many parts of the world, the most significant of which are the distribution facilities located in Tomisatomachi, Japan, and in Laakdal, Belgium, both of which we own. We manufacture Air-Sole cushioning materials and components at NIKE IHM, Inc. manufacturing facilities located in Beaverton, Oregon and St. Charles, Missouri, which we own. We also manufacture and sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through NIKE IHM, Inc. Aside from the principal properties described above, we lease three production offices outside the United States, over 100 sales offices and showrooms worldwide, and approximately 65 administrative offices worldwide. We lease more than 600 retail stores worldwide, which consist primarily of factory outlet stores. See United States Market and International Markets starting on page 2 of this Report. Our leases expire at various dates through the year 2035. ##TABLE_START ", "3": " Item 3.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_END Overview NIKE designs, develops and markets high quality footwear, apparel, equipment and accessory products worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts, NIKE-owned retail, including stores and e-commerce, independent distributors, franchisees and licensees worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, must have products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands, and delivering compelling retail presentation and experiences. Aside from achieving long-term revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operating excellence in several key areas: ##TABLE_START    Making our supply chain a competitive advantage, through operational discipline, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Reducing product costs through a continued focus on lean manufacturing and product design that strives to eliminate waste, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross margin, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of brands to eliminate duplicative costs, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Improving working capital efficiency, and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Deploying capital effectively to create value for our shareholders. ##TABLE_END Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals continue to be: ##TABLE_START    High single-digit revenue growth, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Mid-teens earnings per share growth, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows, and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. ##TABLE_END  Since the adoption of this long-term strategy in 2001, NIKE, Inc.s revenues and earnings per share have grown 8% and 14%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. During the same period, our return on invested capital has increased from 14% to 21%. While macroeconomic conditions in fiscal 2010 continued to remain challenging, putting significant pressure on consumer spending in most markets worldwide, we have continued to focus on achieving appropriate financial performance, while extending our market leadership and positioning ourselves for sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. NIKE, Inc.s fiscal 2010 revenues declined 1% to $19.0 billion, net income increased 28% to $1.9 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $3.86, a 27% increase versus fiscal 2009. Our fiscal 2009 reported results contain significant non-comparable transactions, including an after-tax charge of $145 million for restructuring activities, recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, and an after-tax charge of $241 million for the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets of Umbro, which was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Excluding these non-comparable items, our fiscal 2010 net income would have increased 2% and diluted earnings per share would have increased 1% compared to fiscal 2009 (see Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Excluding Non-Comparable items below). The increase in net income excluding non-comparable items was primarily driven by an improved gross margin percentage and a reduction in our effective tax rate, which more than offset the reduction in revenues and higher selling and administrative expenses. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily the result of favorable product mix, cost reduction initiatives, lower input costs and sales growth in our NIKE-owned retail business. Our year-over-year effective tax rate improvement was driven by continued benefit from our international businesses, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. The increase in selling and administrative expense was primarily attributable to an increase in performance-based compensation as well as investments in our NIKE-owned retail business, which more than offset reductions in compensation expense resulting from restructuring activities that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2010, diluted earnings per share grew at a slightly lower rate than net income given higher average outstanding shares. In fiscal 2010, we increased cash flow from operations as a result of working capital reductions, reflecting our efforts to aggressively manage inventory levels and accounts receivable collections. At May 31, 2010, our inventory and accounts receivable balances were down 13% and 8%, respectively, compared to May 31, 2009. During fiscal 2010, we also returned larger amounts of cash to our shareholders through higher dividends and increased share repurchases compared to fiscal 2009. Although most of our businesses reported revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010, the majority returned to growth in the second half of fiscal 2010. Futures orders for NIKE Brand Footwear and Apparel scheduled for delivery during the first six months of fiscal 2011 increased 7% as compared to the same periods in the prior year. While we continue to believe that the Company is well positioned from a business and financial perspective, our future performance is subject to the inherent uncertainty presented by volatile macroeconomic conditions that may have an impact on our operations around the world. These conditions could continue to affect our business in a number of direct and indirect ways, including lower revenue from slowing consumer/customer demand for our products, reduced profit margins and/or increased costs, changes in interest and currency exchange rates, lack of credit availability and business disruptions due to difficulties experienced by suppliers and customers. Our future performance is subject to our continued ability to take appropriate actions to respond to these conditions.

In addition, this schedule is provided to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding these non-comparable items for fiscal 2009. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  During fiscal 2009, we announced a plan to restructure the organization of the Company. As part of this plan, we streamlined our management structure and eliminated redundancies to enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market, and establish a more scalable cost structure. As a result of these actions, we recorded $195 million of pre-tax restructuring charges in fiscal 2009. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3)  During fiscal 2009, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of Umbros goodwill, indefinite-lived trademark and other assets. The tax benefit related to this impairment charge reduced our effective tax rate by 250 basis points for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2009. ##TABLE_END  Consolidated Operating Results Revenues ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2010  Fiscal 2009  FY10 vs. FY09 % Change   FY10 vs. FY09 % Change Excluding Currency Changes (1)   Fiscal 2008  FY09 vs. FY08 % Change   FY09 vs. FY08 % Change Excluding Currency Changes (1)    (In millions)  Revenues  $ 19,014  $ 19,176  -1 %  -2 %  $ 18,627  3 %  4 % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Results have been restated using exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for NIKE, Inc. declined 2%, driven primarily by a 2% decline in revenues for the NIKE Brand. All of our geographies delivered lower revenues with the exception of Emerging Markets, reflecting a challenging economic environment across most markets, most notably in our Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe geographies. By product group, revenues for our worldwide NIKE Brand footwear business were down 1% compared to the prior year. Worldwide NIKE Brand apparel and equipment revenues declined 5% and 7%, respectively. While our wholesale business remains the largest component of our NIKE Brand revenues, our NIKE-owned retail business continues to grow, representing approximately 15% of our total NIKE Brand revenues in fiscal 2010 as compared to 13% in fiscal 2009. Revenues from our Other Businesses were comprised of results from Cole Haan, Converse, Inc., Hurley International, LLC, NIKE Golf and Umbro, Ltd. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for these businesses increased by 4% for fiscal 2010, driven by increased revenues at Converse, Umbro and Hurley, which more than offset revenue declines at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan. Futures Orders Translated into US dollars at prior year exchange rates, worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2010 were 10% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. This futures growth was driven by increases in unit sales volume for our footwear products and growth in average unit price for both of our apparel and footwear products. Futures orders increased 7% when translated at forecasted exchange rates for the next six months, which approximate current spot rates. The reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, and because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders and that the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between advance/futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE equipment, sales from our Other Businesses and certain retail sales across all brands. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for NIKE, Inc. grew 4%, driven primarily by a 4% increase in revenues for the NIKE Brand. The North America geography contributed nearly 1 percentage point of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2009, while the remaining geographies contributed  over 2 percentage points. During fiscal 2009, most of our geographies posted higher revenues. By product group, our worldwide NIKE Brand footwear business reported revenue growth of 6% and contributed $575 million of incremental revenue. Worldwide NIKE Brand apparel revenues were in line with the prior year, while equipment revenues declined 2% or $20 million. Our Other Businesses, comprised of results from Cole Haan, Converse Inc., Hurley International LLC, NIKE Golf, and Umbro in fiscal 2009, constituted the remaining revenue. In fiscal 2008, our Other Businesses also included Exeter Brands Group (whose primary business was the Starter brand business which was sold on December 17, 2007) and NIKE Bauer Hockey (which was sold on April 17, 2008). Umbro was acquired on March 3, 2008. Revenues for these businesses were flat compared to fiscal 2008. Gross Margin ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2010   Fiscal 2009   FY10 vs. FY09 % Change  Fiscal 2008   FY09 vs. FY08 % Change    (In millions)  Gross Margin  $ 8,800   $ 8,604   2%  $ 8,387   3%  Gross Margin %   46.3 %   44.9 %  140 bps   45.0 %  (10 bps ) ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, our consolidated gross margin percentage was 140 basis points higher than the prior year. The primary factors contributing to this improvement were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Improved in-line product margins across most geographies, driven by reduced raw material and freight costs as well as favorable changes in product mix; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Improved inventory positions, most notably in North America and Western Europe, which drove a shift in mix from discounted close-out to higher margin in-line sales; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Growth of NIKE-owned retail as a percentage of total revenue, across most NIKE Brand geographies, driven by an increase in both new store openings and comparable store sales. ##TABLE_END Together, these factors increased consolidated gross margins by approximately 160 basis points for fiscal 2010. These increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates, primarily affecting our Emerging Markets and Central and Eastern Europe geographies. We anticipate our gross margins in fiscal 2011 may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic factors including changes in currency exchange rates and rising costs for product input costs. We also anticipate higher air freight costs as we work with our suppliers to meet increasing demand for certain running footwear products in the first half of the year. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 During fiscal 2009, the primary factors contributing to the 10 basis point decline in consolidated gross margin percentage versus the prior year were lower gross pricing margins and increased discounts which, when combined, decreased consolidated gross margins by approximately 60 basis points. This decrease was partially offset by improved hedge rates relative to the prior year, primarily in the Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe geographies. Gross pricing margins were lower, primarily driven by higher product input costs, most notably for footwear products. Higher levels of discounts were provided across all businesses in fiscal 2009 to manage inventory levels.  Selling and Administrative Expense ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2010   Fiscal 2009  FY10 vs. FY09 % Change  Fiscal 2008   FY09 vs. FY08 % Change   (In millions) Operating overhead expense  $ 3,970   $ 3,798  5%  $ 3,645   4% Demand creation expense (1)   2,356    2,352  0%   2,309   2%              Selling and administrative expense  $ 6,326   $ 6,150  3%  $ 5,954   3% % of Revenues   33.3 %   32.1%  120 bps   32.0 %  10 bps ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased selling and administrative expense by 1 percentage point in fiscal 2010. Excluding changes in exchange rates, operating overhead expense increased 4% compared to the prior year due primarily to increases in performance-based compensation and investments in NIKE-owned retail. These increases were partially offset by reductions in compensation spending in fiscal 2010 as a result of restructuring activities that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, changes in currency exchange rates had a minimal impact on demand creation expense. Demand creation expense remained flat compared to the prior year, as increases in sports marketing and digital marketing expenses were offset by reductions in advertising. In fiscal 2011, we will continue to focus our resources on those investments that drive sustainable and profitable growth. We expect demand creation will increase at a slightly slower rate than revenues, with spending weighted toward the first quarter driven by key events including the 2010 World Cup. We anticipate operating overhead will grow at a mid single-digit rate, with faster growth in the first half of the fiscal year, driven by increased investments in our NIKE-owned retail business. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased selling and administrative expense by 2 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Excluding changes in exchange rates, operating overhead increased 6% during fiscal 2009. The increase in operating overhead was primarily attributable to investments in growth drivers such as NIKE-owned retail in the North America, Western Europe, Greater China, and Japan geographies, infrastructure for the Emerging Markets and Central and Eastern Europe geographies as well as for our non-NIKE Brand businesses, which more than offset steps taken to reduce operating overhead spending, including implementation of a hiring freeze and reductions in spending for travel and meetings. On a constant-currency basis, demand creation expense increased 3% during fiscal 2009. Demand creation spending decreased in the second half of fiscal 2009 as a result of actions taken to reduce spending across nearly all demand creation related activities, most notably traditional media and print advertising. The increase in demand creation during the first half of fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to strategic investments, including first quarter spending around the Beijing Summer Olympics and the European Football Championships, and increased investments in athlete and team endorsements across all geographies. Restructuring Charges During fiscal 2009, we restructured the organization to streamline our management structure, enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure. As a result  of these actions, we reduced our global workforce by approximately 5% and incurred pre-tax restructuring charges of $195 million in fiscal 2009, primarily consisting of cash severance costs. These charges are included in Corporate for segment reporting purposes. Goodwill, Intangible and Other Asset Impairment In fiscal 2009, we recognized a $401 million pre-tax non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of Umbros goodwill, intangible and other assets. Although Umbros financial performance for fiscal 2009 was slightly better than we had originally expected, projected future cash flows had fallen below the levels we expected at the time of acquisition. This erosion was a result of both the unprecedented decline in global consumer markets, particularly in the United Kingdom, and our decision to adjust the level of investment in the business. We measured the fair value of Umbro by using an equal weighting of the fair value implied by a discounted cash flow analysis and by comparisons with the market values of similar publicly traded companies. We believe the use of both models compensated for the inherent risk associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis, and this combination was indicative of the factors a market participant would consider when performing a similar valuation. The fair value of Umbros indefinite-lived trademark was estimated using the relief from royalty method, which assumes that the trademark has value to the extent that Umbro is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the trademark. Our assessments resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of $199 million and $181 million related to Umbros goodwill and trademark, respectively, in fiscal 2009. In addition to the impairment analysis, we determined an equity investment held by Umbro was also impaired, and recognized a charge of $21 million related to the impairment of that investment. These charges are included in our Other Businesses category for segment reporting purposes. For additional information about our impairment charges, see Note 4  Acquisition, Identifiable Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Umbro Impairment in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other (Income) Expense, net ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2010   Fiscal 2009   FY10 vs. FY09 % Change   Fiscal 2008  FY09 vs. FY08 % Change   (In millions) Other (income) expense, net  $ (49 )  $ (89 )  -45 %  $ 8   ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Other (income) expense, net is primarily comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, and unusual or non-recurring transactions that are outside the normal course of business. For fiscal 2010, other (income) expense, net was primarily comprised of net foreign currency gains and the recognition of previously deferred licensing income related to our fiscal 2008 sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey. For fiscal 2010, we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains included in other (income) expense, net increased our income before income taxes by approximately $34 million. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 For fiscal 2009, other (income) expense, net was primarily comprised of $43 million of foreign currency conversion gains and the recognition of $24 million of licensing income related to our fiscal 2008 sale of the  NIKE Bauer Hockey business. For fiscal 2008, other (income) expense, net was primarily comprised of a $32 million gain on the sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey and a $29 million gain on the sale of the Starter brand business, as well as foreign currency conversion losses of $77 million. For fiscal 2009, we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other (income) expense, net increased our income before income taxes by approximately $124 million. Income Taxes ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2010   Fiscal 2009   FY10 vs. FY09 % Change  Fiscal 2008   FY09 vs. FY08 % Change  Effective tax rate  24.2 %  24.0 %  20 bps  24.8 %  (80 ) bps ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 20 basis points higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2009. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 includes a tax benefit related to charges recorded for the impairment of Umbros goodwill, intangible and other assets. Excluding this tax benefit, our effective rate for fiscal 2009 would have been 26.5%, 230 basis points higher than our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to the continued benefit from our international operations, where tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. We estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2011 will be in line with our fiscal 2010 effective tax rate. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was 80 basis points lower than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 due primarily to the tax benefit related to the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets of Umbro which had a favorable impact of 250 basis points. Profits earned outside of the U.S., the impact of the resolution of foreign audit items and the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit also favorably impacted our fiscal 2009 effective tax rate. Reflected in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was a one-time tax benefit of $105 million, which had a favorable impact of 420 basis points on our effective tax rate. Operating Segments As part of the restructuring initiative that took place in fiscal 2009, the Company changed the geographic structure of NIKE Brand to six geographies to streamline its management structure, enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure. Effective June 1, 2009, the Companys new reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand became: North America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Previously, NIKE Brand operations were organized into four regions: U.S., Europe, Middle East and Africa (collectively, EMEA), Asia Pacific, and Americas. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and are used to record any non-functional currency revenues or product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Geographic operating segment revenues and cost of sales reflect use of these standard rates. For all NIKE Brand operating segments, differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the centrally managed foreign  exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, foreign currency hedge results along with other conversion gains and losses generated by the Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographies.

This decrease was partially offset by an increase in our NIKE-owned retail business, driven primarily by an increase in comparable store sales. On a currency neutral basis, futures orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 7% higher compared to the same period in the prior year. During fiscal 2010, the decrease in North America footwear revenue was primarily attributable to a low single-digit percentage decrease in unit sales, while average selling price per pair remained flat. The decline in unit sales was primarily driven by lower sales for our kids and running products in the first half of fiscal 2010.  North America apparel revenue during fiscal 2010 was flat when compared to fiscal 2009, which was reflective of a high single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per unit, offset by a low double-digit percentage decrease in unit sales. Both the increase in average selling price per unit and the decrease in unit sales were primarily a result of fewer close-out sales compared to the prior year. For fiscal 2010, the increase in North Americas EBIT was primarily the result of improved gross margins combined with a slight decrease in selling and administrative expense, driven by a reduction in demand creation expense compared to prior year. The improvement in gross margin was mainly attributable to a shift in mix from close-out to in-line sales, growth of NIKE-owned retail as a percentage of total sales, improved in-line product margins and lower warehousing costs. The reduction in demand creation expense was primarily attributable to lower spending on advertising. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 During fiscal 2009, the increase in North America footwear revenue was the result of low single-digit growth in both unit sales and average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was primarily driven by higher demand for our Jordan brand, action sports and kids products. The increase in average selling price per pair was attributable to selective price increases, primarily during the first half of fiscal 2009, and increased sales mix of higher priced Jordan brand products, partially offset by increased sales mix of kids products which are generally lower priced. The year-over-year decrease in North America apparel revenues during fiscal 2009 reflected a mid single-digit decrease in unit sales, primarily driven by a reduction in products sold to value channel retailers and generally softer demand in the overall apparel market. Average selling prices increased slightly as a result of the reduction in products sold to value retailers, mostly offset by an increased mix of close-out sales and higher levels of discounts provided retailers to manage inventory levels. EBIT for the North America geography declined in fiscal 2009 as a result of higher operating overhead expense and lower gross margins. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in NIKE-owned retail. Gross margins decreased as a result of higher warehousing costs, higher retail inventory markdowns and increased customer discounts provided to manage inventory levels.

Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, futures orders scheduled for delivery during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 11% higher compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by strong growth across most markets and product categories. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, the decrease in footwear revenue during fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of low single-digit decreases in both average selling price and unit sales. The decrease in average selling price was attributable to higher customer discounts provided to manage inventory levels, while the reduction in unit sales was due to lower sales for most NIKE Brand product categories. The year-over-year decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a high single-digit decline in unit sales combined with a mid single-digit decrease in average selling price. The decrease in unit sales was due to lower sales for most NIKE Brand product categories, while the decrease in average selling price was a result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels. For fiscal 2010, EBIT for Western Europe declined at a faster rate than revenues, as the increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues more than offset the improvements in gross margin percentage. The increase in selling administrative expense was primarily driven by a higher level of both demand creation spending around the 2010 World Cup and operating overhead expense as a result of investments in NIKE-owned retail and higher performance-based compensation. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to higher in-line product margins, a smaller proportion of close-out sales and reduced inventory obsolescence expense as a result of our leaner inventory positions. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, a number of markets within the geography experienced lower revenues, reflecting a more difficult retail environment. Revenues for the Southern European markets, including Spain, Italy and France declined, while the U.K.  Ireland remained flat compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in footwear revenue was attributable to a low single-digit growth in unit sales. The growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for kids and NIKE Brand sportswear products. Average selling price per pair remained flat compared to the prior year. The decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by lower average selling prices resulting from a higher mix of close-out sales and higher levels of discounts provided to retailers to manage inventory levels, which more than offset a low-single-digit increase in unit sales. The year-over-year increase in EBIT for the Western Europe geography during fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by a higher gross margin percentage, partially offset by slightly higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to improved year-over-year standard currency rates which more than offset higher warehousing costs and discounts on in-line products. The increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was mainly driven by retail expansion across the geography.

We are beginning to see signs of stabilization in these markets as a result of improving macroeconomic conditions, increasing brand momentum, and tight management of inventory. On a currency-neutral basis, future orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 3% higher compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in footwear revenue was due to a decline in average selling price, while unit sales remained flat compared to fiscal 2009. The decline in average selling price was primarily the result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels. The year-over-year decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a double-digit decrease in average selling price and a mid single-digit decline in unit sales. The decline in average selling price was primarily the result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels, while the decline in unit sales was due to lower sales in most key product categories. The year-over-year decrease in Central and Eastern Europes EBIT during fiscal 2010 was the result of lower revenues, a decline in gross margin percentage and higher selling and administrative expense. The decline in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to less favorable year-over-year standard currency rates, as well as higher discounts provided to customers. The increase in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in the reserve for bad debts along with increased investments in NIKE-owned retail. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 On a currency neutral basis, revenue for the Central and Eastern Europe geography grew by approximately 9 percentage points in fiscal 2009, driven by stronger results in Russia. The increase in footwear revenue was primarily attributable to a double-digit growth in unit sales. The growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for NIKE Brand sportswear, kids, and running products. The increase in apparel revenues was primarily driven by a double digit percentage increase in unit sales, partially offset by a mid-single digit decrease in average selling price, resulting from a higher mix of close-out sales.  The year-over-year increase in EBIT for Central and Eastern Europe during fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by higher revenues and improved gross margin percentage. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to improved in-line product margins which more than offset higher discounts on in-line products and warehousing costs.

Greater China began to gain momentum in the second half of fiscal 2010, as revenues increased 11% as compared to the second half of fiscal 2009. On a currency-neutral basis, futures orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 16% higher compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in footwear revenue was primarily driven by a mid single-digit increase in average selling price, partially offset by a mid single-digit decrease in unit sales. The increase in average selling price was primarily due to strategic product pricing increases, while the decrease in unit sales was primarily driven by lower discounts on in-line products compared to the prior year. The decrease in apparel revenue for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a mid single-digit decrease in unit sales across most major categories, which more than offset a low single-digit increase in average selling price primarily driven by strategic product pricing increases. EBIT for Greater China increased at a faster rate than revenue as a result of higher gross margins and reductions in demand creation spending attributable to comparisons against higher prior year spending around the Beijing Olympics. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Greater China continued to deliver strong results in fiscal 2009 as revenues increased 21% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by expansion in both the number of stores selling NIKE products and sales through existing stores. Chinas rate of revenue growth slowed to 6% on a currency neutral basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as we lapped very strong growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The increase in both footwear and apparel revenues was driven primarily by a double-digit increase in unit sales. The growth in unit sales was partially offset by a reduction in average selling price in fiscal 2009, resulting primarily from increased discounts on in-line products provided to retailers to manage inventory levels.  The increase in EBIT for Greater China for fiscal 2009 was driven by higher revenues, which more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. Selling and administrative expense increased, but represented a lower percentage of revenues for fiscal 2009. The increase in selling and administrative expense during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to retail and infrastructure expansion and spending around brand events.

The decline in revenues was reflective of a difficult and highly promotional marketplace in Japan. As we enter fiscal 2011, we anticipate macroeconomic conditions in Japan to remain difficult. On a currency-neutral basis, futures orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 16% lower compared to the same period in the prior year. For fiscal 2010, the decrease in Japans EBIT was primarily due to lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense, driven by increased investments in NIKE-owned retail, which more than offset improved gross margins. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 For fiscal 2009, the increase in Japans footwear revenue was driven primarily by a mid-single digit increase in unit sales, partially offset by a reduction in average selling price. The slight increase in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a low-single digit increase in average selling price, while unit sales remained flat compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in EBIT for fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal 2008.

Futures orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 increased 30% on a currency neutral basis. Footwear revenue growth was primarily driven by a double-digit growth in unit sales and a mid single-digit increase in average selling price per pair during fiscal 2010, reflective of strong demand for most NIKE Brand product categories in all markets within the geography. For fiscal 2010, the increase in Emerging Markets EBIT was primarily the result of revenue growth combined with lower selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a decrease in gross margin percentage. The decrease in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to lower operating overhead expense resulting from fiscal 2009 restructuring activities. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to less favorable year-over-year standard currency rates assigned to the geography, which more than offset improved in-line product margins. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, most markets in the Emerging Markets geography reported revenue growth in fiscal 2009, led by Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. The increase in footwear revenue was primarily driven by a double-digit increase in unit sales, partially offset by a low-single digit reduction in average selling price. The increase in EBIT for fiscal 2009 was primarily the result of revenue growth and lower selling and administrative expense. The decrease in selling and administrative expense was mainly driven by a reduction in spending around advertising and sports marketing.

Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, the increase in Global Brand Divisions loss before interest and taxes was largely due to increases in centrally managed demand creation expense and performance-based compensation, which more than offset an increase in licensing revenues. The increase in demand creation expense was primarily driven by the centralization of certain marketing production costs. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 The increase in Global Brand Divisions loss before interest and taxes was mainly attributable to a decrease in licensing revenues and an increase in selling and administrative expense driven by higher operating overhead and increased demand creation spending.

For fiscal 2010, the increase in Other Businesses revenue was primarily driven by revenue growth at Converse, Umbro and Hurley, which more than offset the declines at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan due to reductions in consumer discretionary spending in their respective markets. In fiscal 2009, EBIT for our Other Businesses included a $401 million pre-tax non-cash charge relating to the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets of Umbro. Excluding this impairment charge, EBIT for our Other Businesses would have increased 43%, as a result of higher revenues, improved gross margins across most businesses, and lower demand creation spending. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 For fiscal 2009, our Other Businesses were comprised of Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, NIKE Golf and Umbro. For fiscal 2008, our Other Businesses primarily included Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter (whose primary business was the Starter brand business which was sold on December 17, 2007), Hurley, NIKE Bauer Hockey (which was sold on April 17, 2008), NIKE Golf and Umbro (which was acquired on March 3, 2008). Excluding the loss of revenue from NIKE Bauer Hockey and the Starter brand business and the addition of Umbro, Other Businesses revenues for fiscal 2009 would have increased 6%, driven by the strong performance from Converse and Hurley, offset by sales decreases at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan, due to reductions in consumer discretionary spending in their respective markets. EBIT for Other Businesses declined for fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of a $401 million pre-tax non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of Umbros goodwill intangible and other assets. Excluding the impairment charge, the loss of income from NIKE Bauer Hockey and the Starter brand business along with the dilutive impact of Umbro, earnings before interest and taxes for Other Businesses would have decreased by 28%, driven by declines in operating results at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan. For additional information about our impairment charges, see Note 4  Acquisition, Identifiable Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Umbro Impairment in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Corporates loss before interest and taxes consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses, which includes expenses associated with centrally managed departments, depreciation and amortization related to the Companys corporate headquarters, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses, corporate eliminations and other items. In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results include all other foreign currency hedge results generated through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management  program, other conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non- functional currencies, and gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to each entity in NIKE Brand geographic operating segments, which are used to record any non-functional currency product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Prior to fiscal 2010, all foreign currency results, including hedge results and other conversion gains and losses, generated by the Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographic results. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 In fiscal 2009, results for Corporate included a pre-tax restructuring charge of $195 million. Excluding this restructuring charge, loss before interest and taxes for Corporate would have increased by 18%, primarily driven by an increase in performance-based compensation. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 The increase in Corporates loss before interest and taxes in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to pre-tax restructuring charges of $195 million, consisting primarily of cash charges related to severance costs. In fiscal 2009, foreign currency conversion gains (losses) reported in Corporate expense totaled $46 million compared to ($76) million in fiscal 2008, which was primarily driven by a net gain from currency hedges in fiscal 2009 versus a net hedge loss in fiscal 2008. Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices Overview As a global company with significant operations outside the U.S. we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates in the normal course of business. Foreign currency fluctuations affect the recording of transactions, such as sales, purchases and intercompany transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. Our primary foreign currency exposures are related to U.S. dollar transactions at wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, as well as transactions and translation of results denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Chinese Renminbi and Japanese Yen. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. This also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements, dependent upon hedge horizons. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally, on a portfolio basis, to manage those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. on a consolidated basis. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and by hedging remaining material exposures, where practical, using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. The Companys hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Transactional exposures We transact business in various currencies and have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary, which subjects us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: ##TABLE_START  1.  Inventory Purchases  Most of our inventory purchases around the world are denominated in U.S. dollars. This generates foreign currency exposures for all subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. A weaker U.S. dollar reduces the inventory cost in the purchasing subsidiarys functional currency whereas a stronger U.S. dollar increases the inventory cost. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  2.  Non-Functional Currency Revenues  A portion of our Western Europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. British Pound), but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency, generating foreign currency exposure. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  3.  Other Revenues and Costs  Non-functional currency revenues and costs, such as endorsement contracts, intercompany royalties and other payments, generate foreign currency risk to a lesser extent. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  4.  Non-functional Currency Assets and Liabilities  Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations. ##TABLE_END Managing transactional exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. As of May 31, 2010, we use currency forward contracts and options with maturities up to 18 months to hedge the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including non-functional currency revenues and expenses. These are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value of these instruments at May 31, 2010 and 2009 was $206 million and $248 million in assets and $25 million and $12 million in liabilities, respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income (OCI), a component of shareholders equity, and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion was a gain of $5 million for the year ended May 31, 2010. The ineffective portion was immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net. Ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement are not designated as hedges under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. In these cases, the change in value of the instruments is intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related non-functional currency asset or liability. The fair value of these instruments at May 31, 2010 and 2009 was $104 million and $13 million in assets and $140 million and $34 million in liabilities, respectively. The change in value of these instruments is immediately recognized in earnings. The impact of such instruments is included in other (income) expense, net and aims to offset foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses of the exposures being hedged. Refer to Note 18  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional quantitative detail. Translational exposures Substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets and operational results of these foreign currency denominated subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries non-U.S. dollar balance sheets into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to OCI within shareholders equity. In preparing our consolidated statements of income, foreign exchange rate fluctuations impact our operating results as the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. In translation, a weaker U.S. dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues and income before income taxes was a net translation benefit (detriment) of approximately $147 million and $33 million, respectively, for the year ended May 31, 2010 and approximately ($199) million and $4 million, respectively, for the year ended May 31, 2009.  Managing translational exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and options to partially, or entirely, hedge the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. dollar investments. This has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fair value of instruments used in this manner at May 31, 2010 and 2009 was $78 million and $104 million in assets, respectively. There were no instruments in a liability position at May 31, 2010 or 2009. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in OCI and reclassified into earnings in other (income) expense, net in the period during which the hedged available-for-sale investment is sold and affects earnings. Any ineffective portion, which was not material for any period presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net. We estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains included in other (income) expense, net had a favorable impact of approximately $34 million and $124 million on our income before income taxes for fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Refer to Note 18  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional quantitative detail. Net investments in foreign subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. During fiscal 2008, we began to hedge certain net investment positions in Euro-functional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on net investments with the effect of preserving the value of future repatriated earnings. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion, which was not material for any period presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net. To minimize credit risk, we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration. Upon maturity, the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in OCI; concurrent with settlement, we enter into new forward contracts at the current market rate. The fair value of outstanding net investment hedges at May 31, 2010 and 2009 were $32 million in assets and $23 million in liabilities, respectively. Cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled $5 million and $191 million in the years ended May 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $3.2 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2009. Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2010 was net income of $1.9 billion as well as positive cash flows from working capital. Our working capital provided a net positive cash flow of $0.7 billion for fiscal 2010 as compared to a net cash outflow of $0.4 billion for fiscal 2009. The increase in cash flows from working capital  was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, driven by timing of fourth quarter expenses, a decrease in accounts receivable as a result of a shorter collection cycle and slightly lower revenues, and a decrease in inventories, reflective of tighter inventory buys compared to fiscal 2009. Cash used by investing activities was $1.3 billion during fiscal 2010, compared to $0.8 billion for fiscal 2009. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to net purchases of short-term investments of $0.9 billion (net of sales and maturities) in fiscal 2010 compared to $0.5 billion in net purchases of short-term investments during fiscal 2009. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase in cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2010 was a reduction in proceeds for the settlement of net investment hedges compared to the prior year period. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in cash used for purchases of property, plant and equipment. Cash used by financing activities was $1.1 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to $0.7 billion used in fiscal 2009. The increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in payments of notes payable and long-term debt as well as an increase in share repurchases and dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options. In fiscal 2010, we purchased 11.3 million shares of NIKEs Class B common stock for $754 million. During fiscal 2010, we concluded our previous four-year, $3 billion share repurchase program that was approved by the Board of Directors in June 2006. During this program, we repurchased a total of 53.9 million shares. Having completed the program, during the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we began repurchases under the four-year $5 billion program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2008. Of the total 11 million shares repurchased during fiscal 2010, 6.6 million shares were repurchased under this program for $454 million. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2010, and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, Description of Commitment  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  Thereafter  Total   (In millions) Operating Leases  $ 334  $ 264  $ 220  $ 177  $ 148  $ 466  $ 1,609 Long-term Debt   7   178   47   57   7   142   438 Endorsement Contracts (1)   675   638   568   508   411   990   3,790 Product Purchase Obligations (2)   2,676                  2,676 Other (3)   267   108   114   8   3   1   501                      Total  $ 3,959  $ 1,188  $ 949  $ 750  $ 569  $ 1,599  $ 9,014                      ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. ##TABLE_END In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. ##TABLE_START (2)  We generally order product at least 4 to 5 months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business, that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2010. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3)  Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2010. ##TABLE_END The total liability for uncertain tax positions was $282 million, excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2010. We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2010. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. ##TABLE_START   Outstanding as of May 31, 2010   (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand  $ 139 Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port  $ 88 ##TABLE_END As of May 31, 2010, letters of credit of $101 million were outstanding, generally for the purchase of inventory. Capital Resources In December 2008, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which $760 million in debt securities may be issued. As of May 31, 2010, no debt securities had been issued under this shelf registration. We may issue debt securities under the shelf registration in fiscal 2011 depending on general corporate needs. As of May 31, 2010, we had no amounts outstanding under our multi-year, $1 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks. The facility matures in December 2012. Based on our current long-term  senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.15%. The facility fee is 0.05% of the total commitment. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2010, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. As of May 31, 2010, no amounts were outstanding under this program. We may issue commercial paper from time to time during fiscal 2011 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively. Despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets, to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that current cash and short-term investment balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and inputs used, the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, and the transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy. This guidance became effective for us beginning March 1, 2010, except for disclosures relating to purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 assets and liabilities, which will be effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption did not and will not impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations. See Note 6  Fair Value Measurements in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures required under this guidance. In February 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance on subsequent events. Under this amended guidance, SEC filers are no longer required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in originally issued and revised financial statements. This guidance was effective immediately and we adopted these new requirements since the third quarter of fiscal 2010. In June 2009, the FASB established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the Codification) as the single source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for all non-governmental entities. The Codification, which launched July 1, 2009, changes the referencing and organization of accounting guidance. The Codification became effective for us beginning September 1, 2009. The issuance of FASB Codification did not change GAAP and therefore the adoption has only affected how specific references to GAAP literature are disclosed in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  In April 2009, the FASB updated guidance related to fair value measurements to clarify the guidance related to measuring fair value in inactive markets, to modify the recognition and measurement of other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities, and to require public companies to disclose the fair values of financial instruments in interim periods. This updated guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. See Note 6  Fair Value Measurements in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures required under the updated guidance. In June 2008, the FASB issued new accounting guidance applicable when determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities. This guidance clarifies that share-based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive non-forfeitable dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. This guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or earnings per share. In April 2008, the FASB issued amended guidance regarding the determination of the useful life of intangible assets. The guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. The intent of the position is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset. This guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued amended guidance regarding business combinations, establishing principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any resulting goodwill, and any non-controlling interest in an acquiree in its financial statements. This guidance also provides for disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination. This amended guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this amended guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements, but could impact the accounting for future business combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance regarding the accounting and reporting for non-controlling interests in subsidiaries. This guidance clarifies that non-controlling interests in subsidiaries should be accounted for as a component of equity separate from the parents equity. This guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. We do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial positions or results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that revised the guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIE). This new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a VIE and requires an ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. This guidance is effective for us beginning June 1, 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard.  Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict  future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the assets net book value to its salvage value. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in  which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise. We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting units business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry, and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. In measuring the fair value for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain resulting receivable or payable balances. When specific criteria for hedge accounting have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into  net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or when it is not probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the ineffective portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which such changes occur. Once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels, we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction. We use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. When appropriately designated as a hedge, the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, any resulting ineffectiveness would be reported directly to earnings in the period incurred. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.  We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore, and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year-to-date provision equals the expected annual rate. On a quarterly basis, we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other (income) expense, net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Currently, we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk ##TABLE_END In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive or negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash  flows. This also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third party and intercompany transactions. We also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. When we begin hedging exposures, the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within 12 to 18 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than 12 months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in Euros, Japanese Yen and British Pounds. See Section Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices under Item 7 for additional detail. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk (VaR). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $17 million and $68 million at May 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The VaR decreased year-over-year as a result of reduced total notional value of our foreign  currency derivative portfolio combined with decreased foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2010. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $52 million and $207 million during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. We, therefore, consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows. Details of third party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of May 31, 2010. ##TABLE_START   Expected Maturity Date   Year Ending May 31,   2011   2012   2013   2014   2015   Thereafter   Total   Fair Value   (In millions, except interest rates) Foreign Exchange Risk         Japanese Yen Functional Currency         Japanese Yen debt  Fixed rate         Principal payments  $ 7   $ 178   $ 7   $ 7   $ 7   $ 42   $ 248   $ 247 Average interest rate   2.4 %   3.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   3.1 %  Interest Rate Risk         Japanese Yen Functional Currency         Long-term Japanese Yen debt  Fixed rate         Principal payments  $ 7   $ 178   $ 7   $ 7   $ 7   $ 42   $ 248   $ 247 Average interest rate   2.4 %   3.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   3.1 %  U.S. Dollar Functional Currency         Long-term U.S. Dollar debt  Fixed rate swapped to Floating rate         Principal payments  $    $    $ 40   $    $    $ 100   $ 140   $ 152 Average interest rate   0.0 %   0.0 %   1.0 %   0.0 %   0.0 %   0.4 %   0.6 %  Long-term U.S. Dollar debt  Fixed rate         Principal payments  $    $    $    $ 50   $    $    $ 50   $ 54 Average interest rate   0.0 %   0.0 %   0.0 %   4.7 %   0.0 %   0.0 %   4.7 %  ##TABLE_END The fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries.

Financial Statements and Supplemental Data ##TABLE_END Management of NIKE, Inc. is responsible for the information and representations contained in this report. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles we considered appropriate in the circumstances and include some amounts based on our best estimates and judgments. Other financial information in this report is consistent with these financial statements. Our accounting systems include controls designed to reasonably assure assets are safeguarded from unauthorized use or disposition and provide for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These systems are supplemented by the selection and training of qualified financial personnel and an organizational structure providing for appropriate segregation of duties.  An Internal Audit department reviews the results of its work with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, presently consisting of three outside directors. The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews with the independent registered public accounting firm, management and the internal audit staff, the scope and the results of the annual examination, the effectiveness of the accounting control system and other matters relating to the financial affairs of NIKE as they deem appropriate. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have full access to the Committee, with and without the presence of management, to discuss any appropriate matters. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the company that could have a material effect on the financial statements. While reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, it does not mean absolute assurance. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatement and instance of fraud. Controls are susceptible to manipulation, especially in instances of fraud caused by the collusion of two or more people, including our senior management. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2010. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited (1) the consolidated financial statements and (2) the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2010, as stated in their report herein. ##TABLE_START Mark G. Parker  Donald W. Blair Chief Executive Officer and President  Chief Financial Officer ##TABLE_END  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NIKE, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries at May 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the appendix appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ P RICEWATERHOUSE C OOPERS LLP Portland, Oregon July 20, 2010  NIKE, INC.

NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business NIKE, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design, marketing and distribution of athletic and sports-inspired footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories. Wholly-owned NIKE subsidiaries include Cole Haan, which designs, markets and distributes dress and casual shoes, handbags, accessories and coats; Converse Inc., which designs, markets and distributes athletic and causal footwear, apparel and accessories; Hurley International LLC, which designs, markets and distributes action sports and youth lifestyle footwear, apparel and accessories; and Umbro Ltd., which designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and equipment, primarily for the sport of soccer. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Recognition of Revenues Wholesale revenues are recognized when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. This occurs upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. Provisions for sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims from customers are made at the time of sale. As of May 31, 2010 and 2009, the Companys reserve balances for sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims were $370.6 million and $363.6 million, respectively. Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in cost of sales. Advertising and Promotion Advertising production costs are expensed the first time the advertisement is run. Media (TV and print) placement costs are expensed in the month the advertising appears. A significant amount of the Companys promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. Accounting for endorsement payments is based upon specific contract provisions. Generally, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract after giving recognition to periodic performance compliance provisions of the contracts. Prepayments made under contracts are included in prepaid expenses or other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Through cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses retail customers for certain costs of advertising the Companys products. The Company records these costs in selling and administrative expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs, which is when the related revenues are recognized. This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run. Total advertising and promotion expenses were $2,356.4 million, $2,351.3 million, and $2,308.3 million for the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets totaled $260.7 million and $280.0 million at May 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at date of purchase. The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and equivalents approximate fair value. Short-term Investments Short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments, primarily commercial paper, U.S. treasury, U.S. agency, and corporate debt securities, with maturities over three months from the date of purchase. Debt securities that the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At May 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company did not hold any short-term investments that were classified as held-to-maturity. At May 31, 2010 and 2009, short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in other comprehensive income, unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary. The Company considers all available-for-sale securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond three months as current assets within short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet. See Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Companys short term investments. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts receivable from customers. We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in other assets. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $116.7 million and $110.8 million at May 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of which $43.1 million and $36.9 million was classified as long-term and recorded in other assets. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and valued on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) or moving average cost basis. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is determined on a straight-line basis for buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years. Computer software (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) is depreciated on a straight-line basis over 3 to 10 years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The impairment test requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the Company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, the Company measures and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise. The Company generally bases its measurement of fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that the Company expects the reporting unit to generate in the future. The Companys significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: its weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting units business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. The Company believes the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of its reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within its industry; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. In measuring the fair value for these intangible assets, the Company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactions Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. The Companys global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement, the impact of which is recorded in other (income) expense, net, within our consolidated statement of income. Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in other comprehensive income (a component of shareholders equity), debt or net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge, and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is within the cash provided by operations component of the consolidated statement of cash flows. For designated net investment hedges, this is generally within the cash used by investing activities component of the cash flow statement. As our fair value hedges are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps, the cash flows associated with these derivative instruments are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding, which are reflected in net income within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement. See Note 18  Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives. Stock-Based Compensation The Company estimates the fair value of options granted under the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1990 Plan) and employees purchase rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes this fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as selling and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income over the vesting period using the straight-line method. See Note 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for more information on the Companys stock programs. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. United States income taxes are provided currently on financial statement earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are expected to be repatriated. The Company determines annually the amount of undistributed non-U.S. earnings to invest indefinitely in its non-U.S. operations. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  See Note 9  Income Taxes for further discussion. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards. See Note 12  Earnings Per Share for further discussion. Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal year 2010 presentation, including a reclassification to investing activities for the settlement of net investment hedges in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended May 31, 2008. These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported results of operations or shareholders equity and do not affect previously reported cash flows from operations, financing activities or net change in cash and equivalents. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards: In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and inputs used, the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, and the transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy. This guidance became effective for the Company beginning March 1, 2010, except for disclosures relating to purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 assets and liabilities, which will be effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2011. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption did not and will not impact the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. See Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for disclosure required under this guidance. In February 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance on subsequent events. Under this amended guidance, SEC filers are no longer required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in originally issued and revised financial statements. This guidance was effective immediately and the Company adopted these new requirements since the third quarter of fiscal 2010. In June 2009, the FASB established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the Codification) as the single source of authoritative U.S. GAAP for all non-governmental entities. The Codification, which launched July 1, 2009, changes the referencing and organization of accounting guidance. The Codification became effective for the Company beginning September 1, 2009. The issuance of the FASB Codification did not change GAAP and therefore the adoption has only affected how specific references to GAAP literature are disclosed in the notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  In April 2009, the FASB updated guidance related to fair value measurements to clarify the guidance related to measuring fair value in inactive markets, to modify the recognition and measurement of other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities, and to require public companies to disclose the fair values of financial instruments in interim periods. This updated guidance became effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. See Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for disclosure required under the updated guidance. In June 2008, the FASB issued new accounting guidance applicable when determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities. This guidance clarifies that share-based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive non-forfeitable dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. This guidance became effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In April 2008, the FASB issued amended guidance regarding the determination of the useful life of intangible assets. This guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. The intent of the position is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset. This guidance became effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued amended guidance regarding business combinations, establishing principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any resulting goodwill, and any non-controlling interest in an acquiree in its financial statements. This guidance also provides for disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination. This amended guidance became effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this amended guidance did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements, but could impact the accounting for future business combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance regarding the accounting and reporting for non-controlling interests in subsidiaries. This guidance clarifies that non-controlling interests in subsidiaries should be accounted for as a component of equity separate from the parents equity. This guidance became effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. Recently Issued Accounting Standards: In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2011. The Company does not expect the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated financial positions or results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that revised the guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIE). This new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and requires an ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2010. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard. Note 2  Inventories Inventory balances of $2,040.8 million and $2,357.0 million at May 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were substantially all finished goods.

Note 4  Acquisition, Identifiable Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Umbro Impairment Acquisition On March 3, 2008, the Company completed its acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Umbro, a leading United Kingdom-based global soccer brand, for a purchase price of 290.5 million British Pounds Sterling in cash (approximately $576.4 million), inclusive of direct transaction costs. This acquisition is intended to strengthen the Companys market position in the United Kingdom and expand NIKEs global leadership in soccer, a key area of growth for the Company. This acquisition also provides positions in emerging soccer markets such as China, Russia and Brazil. The results of Umbros operations have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition as part of the Companys Other operating segment. The acquisition of Umbro was accounted for as a purchase business combination. The purchase price was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the date of acquisition, with the remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill. Based on our preliminary purchase price allocation at May 31, 2008, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill relating to the purchase approximated $419.5 million and $319.2 million, respectively. Goodwill recognized in this transaction is deductible for tax purposes. Identifiable intangible assets include $378.4 million for trademarks that have an indefinite life, and $41.1 million for other intangible assets consisting of Umbros  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  sourcing network, established customer relationships, and the United Soccer League Franchise. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated lives of 12 to 20 years. During fiscal 2009, the Company finalized the purchase-price accounting for Umbro and made revisions to preliminary estimates, including valuations of tangible and intangible assets and certain contingencies, as further evaluations were completed and information was received from third parties subsequent to the acquisition date. These revisions to preliminary estimates resulted in a $12.4 million decrease in the value of identified intangible assets, primarily Umbros sourcing network, and an $11.2 million increase in non-current liabilities, primarily related to liabilities assumed for certain contingencies and adjustments made to deferred taxes related to the fair value of assets acquired. These changes in assets acquired and liabilities assumed affected the amount of goodwill recorded. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price, including transaction costs of the acquisition, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition based on their estimated fair values, including final purchase accounting adjustments (in millions): ##TABLE_START   May 31, 2008 Preliminary   Adjustments   May 31, 2009 Final  Current assets  $ 87.2   $    $ 87.2  Non-current assets   90.2        90.2  Identified intangible assets   419.5    (12.4 )   407.1  Goodwill   319.2    23.6    342.8  Current liabilities   (60.3 )       (60.3 ) Non-current liabilities   (279.4 )   (11.2 )   (290.6 )             Net assets acquired  $ 576.4   $    $ 576.4              ##TABLE_END The pro forma effect of the acquisition on the combined results of operations for fiscal 2008 was not material. Umbro Impairment in Fiscal 2009 The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible assets with an indefinite life below its carrying value. As a result of a significant decline in global consumer demand and continued weakness in the macroeconomic environment, as well as decisions by Company management to adjust planned investment in the Umbro brand, the Company concluded sufficient indicators of impairment existed to require the performance of an interim assessment of Umbros goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2009. Accordingly, the Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment assessment for Umbro by comparing the estimated fair value of Umbro to its carrying amount, and determined there was a potential impairment of goodwill as the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value. Therefore, the Company performed the second step of the assessment which compared the implied fair value of Umbros goodwill to the book value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the estimated fair value of Umbro to all of its assets and liabilities, including both recognized and unrecognized intangibles, in the same manner as goodwill was determined in the original business combination. The Company measured the fair value of Umbro by using an equal weighting of the fair value implied by a discounted cash flow analysis and by comparisons with the market values of similar publicly traded companies. The Company believes the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risk associated with either  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  model if used on a stand-alone basis, and this combination is indicative of the factors a market participant would consider when performing a similar valuation. The fair value of Umbros indefinite-lived trademark was estimated using the relief from royalty method, which assumes that the trademark has value to the extent that Umbro is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the trademark. The assessments of the Company resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of $199.3 million and $181.3 million related to Umbros goodwill and trademark, respectively, for the year ended May 31, 2009. A tax benefit of $54.5 million was recognized as a result of the trademark impairment charge. In addition to the above impairment analysis, the Company determined an equity investment held by Umbro was impaired, and recognized a charge of $20.7 million related to the impairment of this investment. These charges are included in the Companys Other category for segment reporting purposes. The discounted cash flow analysis calculated the fair value of Umbro using managements business plans and projections as the basis for expected cash flows for the next 12 years and a 3% residual growth rate thereafter. The Company used a weighted average discount rate of 14% in its analysis, which was derived primarily from published sources as well as our adjustment for increased market risk given current market conditions. Other significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow analysis include the rates of projected growth and profitability of Umbros business and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of Umbro based on a comparison of Umbro to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, mix of revenue generated from licensed and direct distribution, and risk of return on investment. Holding all other assumptions constant at the test date, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would reduce the adjusted carrying value of Umbros net assets by an additional 12%. Identified Intangible Assets and Goodwill All goodwill balances are included in the Companys Other category for segment reporting purposes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  Note 6  Fair Value Measurements The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives and available-for-sale securities. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the Company uses a three-level hierarchy established by the FASB which prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach, and cost approach). The levels of hierarchy are described below: ##TABLE_START    Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. ##TABLE_END The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most stringent level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  NIKE, INC.

Adjustments relating to these risks were not material for the years ended May 31, 2010 and 2009. Available-for-sale securities are primarily comprised of investments in U.S. Treasury and agency securities, commercial paper, bonds and money market funds. These securities are valued using market prices on both active markets (level 1) and less active markets (level 2). Level 1 instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily-available pricing sources for comparable instruments.

These purchases are for the Companys operations outside of the United States, Europe and Japan. Accounts payable to Sojitz America are generally due up to 60 days after shipment of goods from the foreign port. The interest rate on such accounts payable is the 60-day London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as of the beginning of the month of the invoice date, plus 0.75%.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  As of May 31, 2010, the Company had no amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program. As of May 31, 2009, the Company had $100.0 million outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.40%. In December 2006, the Company entered into a $1 billion revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The facility matures in December 2012. Based on the Companys current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.15%. The facility fee is 0.05% of the total commitment. Under this agreement, the Company must maintain, among other things, certain minimum specified financial ratios with which the Company was in compliance at May 31, 2010. No amounts were outstanding under this facility as of May 31, 2010 and 2009. Note 8  Long-Term Debt Long-term debt, net of unamortized premiums and discounts and swap fair value adjustments, is comprised of the following: ##TABLE_START   May 31,   2010  2009   (In millions) 5.375% Corporate bond, payable July 8, 2009  $   $ 25.1 5.66% Corporate bond, payable July 23, 2012   27.0   27.4 5.4% Corporate bond, payable August 7, 2012   16.1   16.2 4.7% Corporate bond, payable October 1, 2013   50.0   50.0 5.15% Corporate bond, payable October 15, 2015   112.4   111.1 4.3% Japanese Yen note, payable June 26, 2011   115.7   108.5 1.52125% Japanese Yen note, payable February 14, 2012   55.1   51.7 2.6% Japanese Yen note, maturing August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020   53.1   54.7 2.0% Japanese Yen note, maturing August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020   23.8   24.5       Total   453.2   469.2 Less current maturities   7.4   32.0        $ 445.8  $ 437.2       ##TABLE_END The scheduled maturity of long-term debt in each of the years ending May 31, 2011 through 2015 are $7.4 million, $178.1 million, $47.4 million, $57.4 million and $7.4 million, at face value, respectively. The Companys long-term debt is recorded at adjusted cost, net of amortized premiums and discounts and interest rate swap fair value adjustments. The fair value of long-term debt is estimated based upon quoted prices for similar instruments. The fair value of the Companys long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $453 million at May 31, 2010 and $456 million at May 31, 2009. In fiscal years 2003 and 2004, the Company issued a total of $240 million in medium-term notes of which $190 million, at face value, were outstanding at May 31, 2010. The outstanding notes have coupon rates that range from 4.70% to 5.66% and maturity dates ranging from July 2012 to October 2015. For each of these notes, except the $50 million note maturing in October 2013, the Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby the Company receives fixed interest payments at the same rate as the notes and pays variable interest payments based on the six-month LIBOR plus a spread. Each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding note. At May 31, 2010, the interest rates payable on these swap agreements ranged from approximately 0.3% to 1.1%.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  In June 1996, one of the Companys Japanese subsidiaries, NIKE Logistics YK, borrowed 10.5 billion (approximately $115.7 million as of May 31, 2010) in a private placement with a maturity of June 26, 2011. Interest is paid semi-annually. The agreement provides for early retirement of the borrowing. In July 1999, NIKE Logistics YK assumed a total of 13.0 billion in loans as part of its agreement to purchase a distribution center in Japan, which serves as collateral for the loans. These loans mature in equal quarterly installments during the period August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020. Interest is also paid quarterly. As of May 31, 2010, 7.0 billion (approximately $76.9 million) in loans remain outstanding. In February 2007, NIKE Logistics YK entered into a 5.0 billion (approximately $55.1 million as of May 31, 2010) term loan that replaced certain intercompany borrowings and matures on February 14, 2012. The interest rate on the loan is approximately 1.5% and interest is paid semi-annually.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  A reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,    2010   2009   2008  Federal income tax rate  35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % State taxes, net of federal benefit  1.3 %  1.2 %  1.4 % Foreign earnings  -13.6 %  -14.9 %  -12.9 % Other, net  1.5 %  2.7 %  1.3 %          Effective income tax rate  24.2 %  24.0 %  24.8 %          ##TABLE_END The effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2010 of 24.2% increased from the fiscal 2009 effective rate of 24.0%. The effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2009 was favorably impacted by a tax benefit associated with the impairment of goodwill, intangible, and other assets of Umbro (See Note 4  Acquisition, Identifiable Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Umbro Impairment), and the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit. The Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008, which was signed into law during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, reinstated the U.S. federal research and development tax credit retroactive to January 1, 2008. Also reflected in the effective tax rate for the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is a reduction in our on-going effective tax rate resulting from our operations outside of the United States, as our tax rates on those operations are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Deferred tax assets and (liabilities) are comprised of the following: ##TABLE_START   May 31,    2010   2009    (In millions)  Deferred tax assets:   Allowance for doubtful accounts  $ 16.7   $ 17.9  Inventories   47.3    52.8  Sales return reserves   52.0    52.8  Deferred compensation   143.7    127.3  Stock-based compensation   145.0    127.3  Reserves and accrued liabilities   85.8    66.7  Foreign loss carry-forwards   26.2    31.9  Foreign tax credit carry-forwards   148.3    32.7  Hedges   0.4    1.1  Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries   128.4    272.9  Other   37.0    46.2          Total deferred tax assets   830.8    829.6          Valuation allowance   (36.2 )   (26.0 )         Total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance   794.6    803.6          Deferred tax liabilities:   Property, plant and equipment   (99.3 )   (92.2 ) Intangibles   (98.6 )   (100.7 ) Hedges   (71.5 )   (86.6 ) Other   (8.1 )   (4.2 )         Total deferred tax liability   (277.5 )   (283.7 )         Net deferred tax asset  $ 517.1   $ 519.9          ##TABLE_END  NIKE, INC.

Total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, as of May 31, 2009 was $273.9 million, $110.6 million of which would affect the Companys effective tax rate if recognized in future periods. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The liability for payment of interest and penalties increased $6.0 million, $2.2 million and $41.2 million during the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of May 31, 2010 and 2009, accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions was $81.4 million and $75.4 million, respectively (excluding federal benefit). The Company is subject to taxation primarily in the U.S., China and the Netherlands as well as various state and other foreign jurisdictions. The Company has concluded substantially all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal year 2006. The Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 tax years. The Companys major foreign jurisdictions, China and the Netherlands, have concluded substantially all income tax matters through calendar 1999 and fiscal 2003, respectively. It is reasonably possible that the Internal Revenue Service audits for the 2007, 2008 and 2009 tax years will be completed during the next 12 months, which could result in a decrease in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits. An estimate of the range cannot be made at this time; however, we do not anticipate that total gross unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly as a result of full or partial settlement of audits within the next 12 months. The Company has indefinitely reinvested approximately $3.6 billion of the cumulative undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings would be subject to U.S. taxation if repatriated to the U.S. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with the permanently reinvested cumulative undistributed earnings is not practicable. During the year ended May 31, 2009, a portion of the Companys foreign operations was granted a tax holiday that will phase out in 2019. The decrease in income tax expense for the year ended May 31, 2010 as a result of this arrangement was approximately $30.1 million ($0.06 per diluted share). The effect on income tax expense for the year ended May 31, 2009 was not material. Deferred tax assets at May 31, 2010 and 2009 were reduced by a valuation allowance relating to tax benefits of certain subsidiaries with operating losses where it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The net change in the valuation allowance was an increase of $10.2 million for the year ended May 31, 2010 and a decrease of $14.7 million and $1.6 million for the years ended May 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  The Company does not anticipate that any foreign tax credit carry-forwards will expire. The Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of $89.8 million at May 31, 2010. Such losses will expire as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ending May 31,   2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016- 2028  Indefinite  Total   (In millions) Net Operating Losses  $ 2.0  $ 1.9  $ 3.6  $ 8.9  $ 11.1  $ 25.7  $ 36.6  $ 89.8 ##TABLE_END During the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, income tax benefits attributable to employee stock-based compensation transactions of $56.8 million, $25.4 million, and $68.9 million, respectively, were allocated to shareholders equity. Note 10  Redeemable Preferred Stock Sojitz America is the sole owner of the Companys authorized Redeemable Preferred Stock, $1 par value, which is redeemable at the option of Sojitz America or the Company at par value aggregating $0.3 million. A cumulative dividend of $0.10 per share is payable annually on May 31 and no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock of the Company unless dividends on the Redeemable Preferred Stock have been declared and paid in full. There have been no changes in the Redeemable Preferred Stock in the three years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. As the holder of the Redeemable Preferred Stock, Sojitz America does not have general voting rights but does have the right to vote as a separate class on the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, on merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company or on the sale or assignment of the NIKE trademark for athletic footwear sold in the United States. Note 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation The authorized number of shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value, and Class B Common Stock, no par value, are 175 million and 750 million, respectively. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors. In 1990, the Board of Directors adopted, and the shareholders approved, the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1990 Plan). The 1990 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 132 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with stock options and other awards granted under the plan. The 1990 Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses, and the issuance and sale of restricted stock. The exercise price for non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights and the grant price of restricted stock may not be less than 75% of the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. The exercise price for incentive stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the 1990 Plan. The committee has the authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards, and the other terms and conditions of the awards. The committee has granted substantially all stock options at 100% of the market price on the date of grant. Substantially all stock option grants outstanding under the 1990 Plan were granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year, vest ratably over four years, and expire 10 years from the date of grant. In June 2010, the Board of Directors amended the 1990 Plan to require, among other things, that the exercise price for non-statutory stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  The following table summarizes the Companys total stock-based compensation expense recognized in selling and administrative expense: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,   2010  2009  2008   (In millions) Stock options (1)  $ 134.6  $ 128.8  $ 127.0 ESPPs   13.7   14.4   7.2 Restricted stock   10.7   7.9   6.8          Subtotal   159.0   151.1   141.0 Stock options and restricted stock expense  restructuring (2)      19.5             Total stock-based compensation expense  $ 159.0  $ 170.6  $ 141.0          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Accelerated stock option expense is recorded for employees eligible for accelerated stock option vesting upon retirement. Accelerated stock option expense reported during the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $74.4 million, $58.7 million and $40.7 million, respectively. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  In connection with the restructuring activities that took place during fiscal 2009, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense relating to the modification of stock option agreements, allowing for an extended post-termination exercise period, and accelerated vesting of restricted stock as part of severance packages. See Note 16  Restructuring Charges for further details. ##TABLE_END As of May 31, 2010, the Company had $86.8 million of unrecognized compensation costs from stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, to be recognized as selling and administrative expense over a weighted average period of 2.2 years. The weighted average fair value per share of the options granted during the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, as computed using the Black-Scholes pricing model, was $23.43, $17.13 and $13.87, respectively. The weighted average assumptions used to estimate these fair values are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,    2010   2009   2008  Dividend yield  1.9 %  1.5 %  1.4 % Expected volatility  57.6 %  32.5 %  20.0 % Weighted average expected life (in years)  5.0   5.0   5.0  Risk-free interest rate  2.5 %  3.4 %  4.8 % ##TABLE_END The Company estimates the expected volatility based on the implied volatility in market traded options on the Companys common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. The weighted average expected life of options is based on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns. The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rate in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the options.  NIKE, INC.

The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable at May 31, 2010 was $926.8 million and $636.0 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value was the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of the options. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $239.3 million, $108.4 million and $259.4 million, respectively. In addition to the 1990 Plan, the Company gives employees the right to purchase shares at a discount to the market price under employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs). Employees are eligible to participate through payroll deductions up to 10% of their compensation. At the end of each six-month offering period, shares are purchased by the participants at 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or the end of the offering period. Employees purchased 0.8 million shares, 1.0 million shares and 0.8 million shares during the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. From time to time, the Company grants restricted stock and unrestricted stock to key employees under the 1990 Plan. The number of shares granted to employees during the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were 499,000, 75,000 and 110,000 with weighted average values per share of $53.16, $56.97 and $59.50, respectively. Recipients of restricted shares are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respective shares throughout the period of restriction. The value of all of the granted shares was established by the market price on the date of grant. During the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the fair value of restricted shares vested was $8.0 million, $9.9 million and $9.0 million, respectively, determined as of the date of vesting.

The terms of the plan call for annual contributions by the Company as determined by the Board of Directors. A subsidiary of the Company also has a profit sharing plan available to its U.S.-based employees. The terms of the plan call for annual contributions as determined by the subsidiarys executive management. Contributions of $34.9 million, $27.6 million and $37.3 million were made to the plans and are included in selling and administrative expense for the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The Company also has a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) that was adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by shareholders in September 1997 and later amended in fiscal 2007. The Company recognized $24.1 million, $17.6 million and $35.9 million of selling and administrative expense related to cash awards under the LTIP during the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company has pension plans in various countries worldwide. The pension plans are only available to local employees and are generally government mandated. The liability related to the unfunded pension liabilities of the plans was $113.0 million and $82.8 million at May 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  NIKE, INC.

As of May 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling $101.1 million and $154.8 million, respectively. These letters of credit were generally issued for the purchase of inventory. In connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the Companys historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. The Company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings that will have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Note 16  Restructuring Charges During fiscal 2009, the Company took necessary steps to streamline its management structure, enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable, long-term cost structure. As a result, the Company reduced its global workforce by approximately 5% and incurred pre-tax restructuring charges of $195 million, primarily consisting of severance costs related to the workforce reduction. As nearly all of the restructuring activities were completed in fiscal 2009, the Company does not expect to recognize additional costs in future periods relating to these actions. The restructuring charge is reflected in the corporate expense line in the segment presentation of earnings before interest and taxes in Note 19  Operating Segments and Related Information.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  The activity in the restructuring accrual for the years ended May 31, 2010 and 2009 is as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START Restructuring accrual  June 1, 2008  $   Severance and related costs   195.0  Cash payments   (29.4 ) Non-cash stock option and restricted stock expense   (19.5 ) Foreign currency translation and other   3.5      Restructuring accrual  May 31, 2009   149.6  Cash payments   (142.6 ) Foreign currency translation and other   1.2      Restructuring accrual  May 31, 2010  $ 8.2      ##TABLE_END The accrual balance as of May 31, 2010 will be relieved throughout the first half of fiscal year 2011, as final severance payments are completed. The restructuring accrual is included in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Note 17  Divestitures On December 17, 2007, the Company completed the sale of the Starter brand business to Iconix Brand Group, Inc. for $60.0 million in cash. This transaction resulted in a gain of $28.6 million during the year ended May 31, 2008. On April 17, 2008, the Company completed the sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey for $189.2 million in cash to a group of private investors (the Buyer). The sale resulted in a net gain of $32.0 million recorded in the fourth quarter of the year ended May 31, 2008. This gain included the recognition of a $46.3 million cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income. As part of the terms of the sale agreement, the Company granted the Buyer a royalty free limited license for the use of certain NIKE trademarks for a transitional period of approximately two years. The Company deferred $41.0 million of the sale proceeds related to this license agreement, to be recognized over the license period. The gains resulting from these divestitures are reflected in other (income) expense, net and in the corporate expense line in the segment presentation of earnings before interest and taxes in Note 19  Operating Segments and Related Information. Note 18  Risk Management and Derivatives The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative trading purposes. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives to either specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also enters into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, which are not designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of hedges of recorded balance sheet positions are recognized  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  immediately in other (income) expense, net, on the income statement together with the transaction gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from these undesignated hedges in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, generally within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2010 are designated as either cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date. The total notional amount of outstanding derivatives as of May 31, 2010 was $6.2 billion, which was primarily comprised of cash flow hedges denominated in Euros, Japanese Yen and British Pounds. The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included within the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2010 and 2009: ##TABLE_START   Asset Derivatives  Liability Derivatives   Balance Sheet Classification  May 31, 2010  May 31, 2009  Balance Sheet Classification  May 31, 2010  May 31, 2009   (In millions) Derivatives formally designated as hedging instruments:       Foreign exchange forwards and options  Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $ 315.9  $ 270.4  Accrued liabilities  $ 24.7  $ 34.6 Interest rate swap contracts  Prepaid expenses and other current assets      0.1  Accrued liabilities       Foreign exchange forwards and options  Deferred income taxes and other assets   0.4   81.3  Deferred income taxes and other liabilities   0.1    Interest rate swap contracts  Deferred income taxes and other assets   14.6   13.7  Deferred income taxes and other liabilities                     Total derivatives formally designated as hedging instruments    330.9   365.5    24.8   34.6               Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:       Foreign exchange forwards and options  Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $ 103.9  $ 12.8  Accrued liabilities  $ 138.9  $ 34.3 Foreign exchange forwards and options  Deferred income taxes and other assets      0.4  Deferred income taxes and other liabilities   1.4                  Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments    103.9   13.2    140.3   34.3               Total derivatives   $ 434.8  $ 378.7   $ 165.1  $ 68.9               ##TABLE_END  NIKE, INC.

NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  Cash Flow Hedges The purpose of the Companys foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the Company from the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from transactions in foreign currencies, including revenues, product costs, selling and administrative expenses, investments in U.S. dollar-denominated available-for-sale debt securities and intercompany transactions, including intercompany borrowings, will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. It is the Companys policy to utilize derivatives to reduce foreign exchange risks where internal netting strategies cannot be effectively employed. Hedged transactions are denominated primarily in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. The Company hedges up to 100% of anticipated exposures typically 12 months in advance, but has hedged as much as 34 months in advance. All changes in fair values of outstanding cash flow hedge derivatives, except the ineffective portion, are recorded in other comprehensive income until net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. In most cases, amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be released to net income some time after the maturity of the related derivative. The consolidated statement of income classification of effective hedge results is the same as that of the underlying exposure. Results of hedges of revenue and product costs are recorded in revenue and cost of sales, respectively, when the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. Results of hedges of selling and administrative expense are recorded together with those costs when the related expense is recorded. Results of hedges of anticipated purchases and sales of U.S. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities are recorded in other (income) expense, net when the securities are sold. Results of hedges of anticipated intercompany transactions are recorded in other (income) expense, net when the transaction occurs. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from these designated cash flow hedge derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, generally within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement. Premiums paid on options are initially recorded as deferred charges. The Company assesses the effectiveness of options based on the total cash flows method and records total changes in the options fair value to other comprehensive income to the degree they are effective. As of May 31, 2010, $187.2 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives accumulated in other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to net income during the next 12 months as a result of underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in net income. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2010, the maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted and recorded transactions is 18 months. The Company formally assesses both at a hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Effectiveness for cash flow hedges is assessed based on forward rates. When it is determined that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it determines that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item (including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions); (2) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (3) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  When the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified to net income when the forecasted transaction affects net income. However, if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in net income. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing future changes in the fair value in other (income) expense, net. For the year ended May 31, 2010, $5.2 million of income was recorded to other (income) expense, net as a result of cash flow hedge ineffectiveness. For the years ended 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded in other (income) expense an immaterial amount of ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges. Fair Value Hedges The Company is also exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives currently used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. As of May 31, 2010, all interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt and meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. The cash flows associated with the Companys fair value hedges are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding, which are reflected in net income within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement. No ineffectiveness has been recorded to net income related to interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. In fiscal 2003, the Company entered into a receive-floating, pay-fixed interest rate swap agreement related to a Japanese Yen denominated intercompany loan with one of the Companys Japanese subsidiaries. This interest rate swap was not designated as a hedge under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap were recorded to net income each period through maturity as a component of interest expense (income), net. Both the intercompany loan and the related interest rate swap matured during the year ended May 31, 2009. Net Investment Hedges The Company also hedges the risk of variability in foreign-currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges, except ineffective portions, are reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its net investment hedges within the cash used by investing component of the cash flow statement. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness based on changes in forward rates. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its net investment hedges for the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. However, this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored and reported to senior management according to prescribed guidelines. The Company utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions either headquartered or operating in the same countries the Company conducts its business. As a result of the above considerations, the Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial. Certain of the Companys derivative instruments contain credit risk related contingent features. As of May 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all such credit risk related contingent features. The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features that are in a net liability position at May 31, 2010 was $18.3 million. The Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features. Note 19  Operating Segments and Related Information Operating Segments. The Companys operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Companys internal organization. The major segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity excluding NIKE Golf. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, production, marketing and selling of sports and fitness footwear, apparel, and equipment. In fiscal 2009, the Company initiated a reorganization of the NIKE Brand into a new model consisting of six geographies. Effective June 1, 2009, the Companys new reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Previously, NIKE Brand operations were organized into the following four geographic regions: U.S., Europe, Middle East and Africa (collectively, EMEA), Asia Pacific, and Americas. The Companys Other category is broken into two components for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. The Global Brand Divisions category primarily represents NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment, selling, general and administrative expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand and costs associated with product development and supply chain operations. The Other Businesses category primarily consists of the activities of Cole Haan, Converse Inc., Hurley International LLC, NIKE Golf and Umbro Ltd. Activities represented in the Other category are considered immaterial for individual disclosure. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the Companys new operating structure described above. Revenues as shown below represent sales to external customers for each segment. Intercompany revenues have been eliminated and are immaterial for separate disclosure. Corporate consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses, which includes expenses associated with centrally managed departments, depreciation and amortization related to the Companys headquarters, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, including stock-based compensation, certain foreign currency gains and losses, including hedge gains and losses, certain corporate eliminations and other items. Effective June 1, 2009, the primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (commonly referred to as EBIT) which represents net income before interest expense (income), net and income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Reconciling items for EBIT represent corporate expense items that are not allocated to the operating segments for management reporting. Previously, the Company evaluated performance of individual operating segments based on pre-tax income or income before income taxes.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  As part of the Companys centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and are used to record any non-functional currency revenues or product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Geographic operating segment revenues and cost of sales reflect use of these standard rates. For all NIKE Brand operating segments, differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses. For the years ended May 31, 2009 and 2008, foreign currency hedge results along with other conversion gains and losses generated by the Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe geographies were recorded in their respective results. Additions to long-lived assets as presented in the following table represent capital expenditures. Accounts receivable, inventories and property, plant and equipment for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2010 presentation.  NIKE, INC.

Business ##TABLE_END General NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1968 under the laws of the state of Oregon. As used in this report, the terms we, us, NIKE and the Company refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our Internet address is www.nike.com. On our NIKE Corporate web site, located at www.nikebiz.com, we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission: our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All such filings on our NIKE Corporate web site are available free of charge. Also available on the NIKE Corporate web site are the charters of the committees of our board of directors, as well as our corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics; copies of any of these documents will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of high quality footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessory products. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores and internet sales, which we refer to as our Direct to Consumer operations, and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees, in over 170 countries around the world. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Virtually all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment products are produced both in the United States and abroad. Products NIKEs athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on high quality construction and innovation in products designed for men, women and children. Running, training, basketball, soccer, sport-inspired casual shoes, and kids shoes are currently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in product sales in the near future. We also market footwear designed for baseball, cheerleading, football, golf, lacrosse, outdoor activities, skateboarding, tennis, volleyball, walking, wrestling, and other athletic and recreational uses. We sell sports apparel and accessories covering most of the above categories, sports-inspired lifestyle apparel, as well as athletic bags and accessory items. NIKE apparel and accessories feature the same trademarks and are sold through the same marketing and distribution channels. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in collections of similar design or for specific purposes. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos. We sell a line of performance equipment under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, electronic devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment, golf clubs, and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc. In addition to the products we sell directly to customers through our Direct to Consumer operations, we have entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell certain apparel, electronic devices and other equipment designed for sports activities. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cole Haan (Cole Haan), headquartered in New York, New York, designs and distributes dress and casual footwear, apparel and accessories for men and women under the Cole Haan  trademark.  Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Converse Inc. (Converse), headquartered in North Andover, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories under the Converse  , Chuck Taylor  , All Star  , One Star  , Star Chevron and Jack Purcell  trademarks. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hurley International LLC (Hurley), headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the Hurley  trademark. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Umbro International Limited (Umbro), headquartered in Cheadle, United Kingdom, designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and equipment, primarily for the sport of football (soccer), under the Umbro  trademark. Sales and Marketing Financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in Note 18 of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 83. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment. Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. We must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. Effective June 1, 2009, we began operating under our new organizational structure for the NIKE Brand, which consists of the following six geographies: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Previously, NIKE Brand operations were organized into the following four geographic regions: U.S., Europe, Middle East and Africa (collectively, EMEA), Asia Pacific, and Americas. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment. United States Market In fiscal 2011, sales in the United States including U.S. sales of our Other Businesses accounted for approximately 43% of total revenues, compared to 42% in fiscal 2010 and 2009. Our Other Businesses were primarily comprised of our affiliate brands; Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and Umbro (which was acquired on March 3, 2008); and NIKE Golf. We estimate that we sell to more than 20,000 retail accounts in the United States. The NIKE Brand domestic retail account base includes a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops, and other retail accounts. During fiscal 2011, our three largest customers accounted for approximately 23% of sales in the United States. We make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price. In fiscal 2011, 87% of our U.S. wholesale footwear shipments (excluding our Other Businesses) were made under the futures program, compared to 89% in fiscal 2010 and 2009. In fiscal 2011, 60% of our U.S. wholesale apparel shipments (excluding our Other Businesses) were made under the futures program, compared to 62% in fiscal 2010 and 60% in fiscal 2009.  We utilize 18 NIKE sales offices to solicit sales in the United States. We also utilize 4 independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf and 5 for skateboarding and snowboarding products. In addition, our Direct to Consumer operations sell NIKE Brand products through our internet website, www.nikestore.com , and the following retail outlets in the United States: ##TABLE_START U.S. Retail Stores  Number  NIKE factory stores   150  NIKE stores   16  NIKETOWNs   9  NIKE employee-only stores   3  Cole Haan stores (including factory stores)   107  Converse stores (including factory stores)   58  Hurley stores (including factory and employee stores)   20      Total   363      ##TABLE_END NIKEs three significant distribution centers in the United States for NIKE Brand products, including NIKE Golf, are located in Memphis, Tennessee. NIKE also operates and leases one facility in Memphis, Tennessee for NIKE Brand product returns. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California distribution center. Cole Haan products are distributed primarily from Greenland, New Hampshire, and Converse and Hurley products are shipped primarily from Ontario, California. International Markets In fiscal 2011, non-U.S. sales (including non-U.S. sales of our Other Businesses) accounted for 57% of total revenues, compared to 58% in fiscal 2010 and 2009. We sell our products to retail accounts, through our own Direct to Consumer operations, and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees around the world. We estimate that we sell to more than 20,000 retail accounts outside the United States, excluding sales by independent distributors and licensees. We operate 16 distribution centers outside of the United States. In many countries and regions, including Canada, Asia, some Latin American countries, and Europe, we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the United States futures program described above. During fiscal 2011, NIKEs three largest customers outside of the U.S. accounted for approximately 9% of total non-U.S. sales. Our Direct to Consumer business operates the following retail outlets outside the United States: ##TABLE_START Non-U.S. Retail Stores  Number  NIKE factory stores   243  NIKE stores   50  NIKETOWNs   3  NIKE employee-only stores   13  Cole Haan stores   83  Hurley stores   1      Total   393      ##TABLE_END International branch offices and subsidiaries of NIKE are located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Lebanon, Macau, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and Vietnam.  Significant Customer No customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales during fiscal 2011. Orders Worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from June through November 2011, were $10.3 billion compared to $8.8 billion for the same period last year. This futures and advance order amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period, which approximate current spot rates. Reported futures and advance orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between futures/advance and at-once orders and the fulfillment of certain of these futures/advance orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Other Businesses. Product Research and Development We believe our research and development efforts are a key factor in our past and future success. Technical innovation in the design of footwear, apparel, and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as NIKE strives to produce products that help to reduce injury, enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort. In addition to NIKEs own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, and other experts who consult with us and review designs, materials, concepts for product improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process. Manufacturing Virtually all of our footwear is produced by factories we contract with outside of the United States. In fiscal 2011, contract factories in Vietnam, China, Indonesia, and India manufactured approximately 39%, 33%, 24% and 2% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. We also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in Argentina, Brazil, India, and Mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. The largest single footwear factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 6% of total fiscal 2011 NIKE Brand footwear production. Almost all of NIKE Brand apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers located in 33 countries. Most of this apparel production occurred in China, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Turkey, Cambodia, El Salvador, and Mexico. The largest single apparel factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 7% of total fiscal 2011 apparel production. The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, nylon, leather, canvas, and polyurethane films used to make Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2011, NIKE IHM, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NIKE, as well as independent contractors in China and Taiwan, were our largest suppliers of the Air-Sole cushioning components used in footwear. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, plastic and metal hardware, and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain, retain heat, or efficiently transport body moisture. NIKEs independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased  by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. We have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements. Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed significant import-export financing services for us. During fiscal 2011, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Brazil, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, South Africa, China, Korea, and Thailand, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 19% of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those jurisdictions. Such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates. Our current agreements with Sojitz America expire on May 31, 2014. International Operations and Trade Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as possible revaluation of currencies, export and import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring. The global economic recession resulted in a significant slow-down in international trade and a sharp rise in protectionist actions around the world. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionist challenges in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together to address trade issues to reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, such actions, if implemented, could result in increases in the cost of our products, which could adversely affect our sales or profitability and the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole. Accordingly, we are actively monitoring the developments described below. Footwear Imports into the European Union In 2005, at the request of the European domestic footwear industry, the European Commission (EC) initiated investigations into leather footwear imported from China and Vietnam. Together with other companies in our industry, we took the position that Special Technology Athletic Footwear (STAF) (i) should not be within the scope of the investigation, and (ii) does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an anti-dumping investigation. Our arguments were successful and the EU agreed in October 2006 on definitive duties of 16.5% for China and 10% for Vietnam for non-STAF leather footwear, but excluded STAF from the final measures. Prior to the scheduled expiration in October 2008 of the measures imposed on the non-STAF footwear, the domestic industry requested and the EC agreed to review a petition to extend these restrictions on non-STAF leather footwear. In December 2009, following a review of the ongoing restrictions, EU member states voted to extend the measures for an additional 15 months, until March 31, 2011. In early 2011, the EC declined to further extend the measures and since April 1, 2011 these restrictions have been terminated. The EC noted that it will be monitoring leather footwear imports from Vietnam and China over the next 12 months and it is hoped that any increases will not result in renewed trade defense actions by the EC. On February 3, 2010, the Chinese government announced it would seek to refer the EU decision (both on the original measures and subsequent review decision) to the World Trade Organization (WTO) for its further review and decision. On May 18, 2010, the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO agreed to establish a panel to rule on Chinas claims against the EU with respect to the above anti-dumping measures. The ruling from the WTO panel is expected in late July or August 2011, after which either party may accept or appeal the findings.  Footwear, Apparel and Equipment Imports into Brazil and Argentina At the request of certain domestic footwear industry participants, both Brazil and Argentina have initiated independent anti-dumping investigations against footwear made in China. Over the last two years, we have been working with a broad coalition of other companies in our industry to challenge these cases on the basis that the athletic footwear being imported from China (i) should not be within the scope of the investigation, and (ii) does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an anti-dumping investigation. In the case of Argentina, in 2010, the final determination made by the administering authorities was favorable to us. In the case of Brazil, the administering authorities agreed to impose an anti-dumping duty against nearly all footwear from China, which we believe will impact all brands in the footwear industry. Although we do not currently expect that this decision will materially affect us, we are working with the same broad coalition of footwear companies to challenge this decision in domestic Brazilian courts as well as international forums such as the WTO. Many products, including footwear, apparel and equipment products, that we and others in our industry import into Argentina and Brazil are subject to the WTO non-automatic licensing requirements, which means that it may take up to 60 days for those products to clear customs and enter into those jurisdictions. From time to time, in addition to these WTO licensing requirements, these jurisdictions impose further importation restrictions or limitations. As a result, we have experienced delays in our ability to import our products or it has taken longer than the time allowed under the WTO for us to import our products. To date, our business has not been materially affected by these restrictions or delays. In the future, however, if we are unable to import our products into these jurisdictions due to these or other restrictions or if we experience increasing or more frequent delays beyond the WTO-permitted 60 days to import our products, our business could be materially affected. Footwear, Apparel and Equipment Imports into Turkey In 2006, Turkey introduced safeguard measures in the form of additional duties on all imported footwear into Turkey with the goal of protecting its local shoe manufacturing industry until August 2009. In June 2009, Turkish shoe-manufacturers submitted, and the Turkish Government agreed to review, a request for extension of the safeguard measures claiming that the rehabilitation process of the local Turkish industry was interrupted due to the continuing increase of footwear imports. Despite the importers opposition to the continuation of the safeguard measures, the Turkish authorities extended these safeguard measures until August 2012, but reduced the duty from $3 per pair of footwear to $1.60 per pair of footwear. In 2011, two new safeguard measures and reviews were initiated by the Turkish Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade (UFT) on apparel and equipment imports. In January 2011, the UFT began an investigation on apparel imports that could result in a 20-30% increase in import duties applied to imported apparel products, regardless of country of origin and with only a few exceptions for countries that currently have a Free Trade Agreement with Turkey. A decision is expected in late July 2011 and if approved, these higher import duties will be in place through July 2014. Together with other companies in our industry, we are advocating for exclusion of certain apparel products used for sporting activities that cannot be manufactured in Turkey and therefore should not be subject to a higher import duty. In February 2011, the UFT began a review of existing safeguard measure on travel goods, handbags and similar accessories and containers listed under applicable regulations. One Turkish bag manufacturers association has requested the continuation of the safeguard measures through April 2014, with the application of an additional import duty of 2.70 USD/kg (max. 4.25 USD/unit), regardless of country of origin. Together with other companies in our industry, we are advocating for the exclusion of non-leather bags from the scope of the continued safeguards. Trade Relations with China China represents an important sourcing country and consumer marketing country for us. Many governments around the world are concerned about Chinas growing and fast-paced economy, compliance with WTO rules, currency valuation, and high trade surpluses. As a result, a wide range of legislative proposals have been introduced to address these concerns. While some of these concerns may be justified, we are working with broad  coalitions of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors (e.g., services, manufacturing, and agriculture) to help ensure any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules, and (iii) reflects and considers Chinas domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community. We believe other companies in our industry as well as most other multi-national companies are in a similar position regarding these trade measures. In the event any of these trade protection measures are implemented, we believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature. We believe our principal competitors are subject to similar risks. Competition The athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the United States and on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes, apparel, and equipment, including Adidas, Puma, and others. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world. Performance and reliability of shoes, apparel, and equipment, new product development, price, product identity through marketing and promotion, and customer support and service are important aspects of competition in the athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry. To help market our products, we contract with prominent and influential athletes, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our products, and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics. We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas. Trademarks and Patents We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE  and Swoosh Design  trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 150 countries. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement. NIKE has an exclusive, worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented Air technology. The process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane. Some of the early NIKE AIR  patents have expired, which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology. Subsequent NIKE AIR  patents will not expire for several years. We also have hundreds of U.S. and foreign utility patents, and thousands of U.S. and foreign design patents covering components and features used in various athletic and leisure shoes, apparel, and equipment. These patents expire at various times, and patents issued for applications filed this year will last from now to 2025 for design patents, and from now to 2031 for utility patents. We believe our success depends primarily upon skills in design, research and development, production, and marketing rather than upon our patent position. However, we have followed a policy of filing applications for United States and foreign patents on inventions, designs, and improvements that we deem valuable. Employees As of May 31, 2011, we had approximately 38,000 employees worldwide, which includes retail and part-time employees. Management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent. None of our employees  is represented by a union, except for certain employees in the Emerging Markets geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union, and in the United States, where certain employees of Cole Haan are represented by a union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require representation for employees by works councils (such as in certain countries in the European Union, in which they are entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or other employee representation by an organization similar to a union, and in certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into and/or comply with (industry wide or national) collective bargaining agreements.

Risk Factors ##TABLE_END Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Analyst Reports Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKEs business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from time to time by  NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, conferences, or otherwise, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate, or imply future results, performance, or achievements, and may contain the words believe, anticipate, expect, estimate, project, will be, will continue, will likely result, or words or phrases of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include, among others, the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products, and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products; difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for NIKE products, and the various market factors described above; difficulties in implementing, operating, and maintaining NIKEs increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning, and inventory control; interruptions in data and communications systems; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance futures orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes in shipment timing, and the changing mix of futures and at-once orders and order cancellations; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKEs products; increases in the cost of materials and energy used to manufacture products, new product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property; performance and reliability of products; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors and licensees; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in our debt ratings; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas, political and economic instability, and terrorism; changes in government regulations; the impact of, including business and legal developments relating to, climate change; liability and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKEs business and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKEs business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKEs policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE. Our products face intense competition. NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. The athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment  industry is keenly competitive in the United States and on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes, apparel, and equipment. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products and for import quota capacity. Our competitors product offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, and customer service are areas of intense competition. This, in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly. If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profits. Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports apparel or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories and lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We rely on technical innovation and high quality products to compete in the market for our products. Although design and aesthetics of our products appear to be the most important factor for consumer acceptance of our products, technical innovation and quality control in the design of footwear, apparel, and athletic equipment is also essential to the commercial success of our products. Research and development plays a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to reduce injury, enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. Failure to continue to obtain high quality endorsers of our products could harm our business. We establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues to evaluate, promote, and establish product authenticity with consumers. If certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues could also harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products, or a failure to enter into cost effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sales of our products.  Failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct, local laws, and other standards could harm our business. We contract with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to manufacture our products, and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract to manufacture products using our trademarks. We impose, and require our licensees to impose, on those contractors a code of conduct and other environmental, health, and safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety. However, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may not require their contractors to comply with such standards or applicable local law. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Global capital and credit market conditions, and resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Continuing volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets have led to a tightening of business credit and liquidity, a contraction of consumer credit, business failures, higher unemployment, and declines in consumer confidence and spending in the United States and internationally. If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate or remain weak for an extended period of time, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition: ##TABLE_START    Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, increased inventories, and lower gross margins. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    We may be unable to find suitable investments that are safe, liquid, and provide a reasonable return. This could result in lower interest income or longer investment horizons. Disruptions to capital markets or the banking system may also impair the value of investments or bank deposits we currently consider safe or liquid. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    We may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The failure of financial institution counterparties to honor their obligations to us under credit and derivative instruments could jeopardize our ability to rely on and benefit from those instruments. Our ability to replace those instruments on the same or similar terms may be limited under poor market conditions. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    We conduct transactions in various currencies, which increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported financial results and condition. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Continued volatility in the markets and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as petroleum) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins, and profitability. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    If retailers of our products experience declining revenues, or retailers experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, inability of retailers to timely meet their payment obligations to us, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts, and increased bad debt expense. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could reduce the availability of our products to consumers. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products. ##TABLE_END Our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results and stock price. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, availability of import quotas and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix, geographic sales trends, and currency exchange rate fluctuations, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues. We make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price. Our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory, purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders, and the risk of non-delivery. We report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports. Although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues, reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of changes in revenues for any future period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, returns, and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Other Businesses. Our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins and harm to our business. We purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, and diminish brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance.  We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers. We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products, we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be cancelled, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties, which have had an adverse effect on our business. As a result, retailers may be more cautious than usual with orders as a result of weakness in the retail economy. A slowing economy in our key markets could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers who experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products. Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk, and impair our ability to sell our products. The athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment retailers with many stores. These retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. These situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity, it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. In addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business. We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying us, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE  and Swoosh Design  trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 150 countries. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We believe that our trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success, and our competitive position. We periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in challenging a partys products on the basis of trademark or design or utility patent infringement, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products. The actions we take to establish and protect trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources. From time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately  predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business. Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments, and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products. In addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets, and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs, or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in higher costs and decreased margins and earnings. A majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. As a result, we conduct transactions in various currencies, which increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. dollars for consolidated financial reporting. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our hedging activities (see Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ), which are designed to minimize and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently mitigate the impact of foreign currencies on our financial results. Factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts, volatility of currency markets, and the availability of hedging instruments. Since the hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, but they  also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities. Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing, and financing. The principal materials used in our apparel products  natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, plastic and metal hardware, and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain, retain heat, or efficiently transport body moisture  are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. The principal materials used in our footwear products  natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, nylon, leather, canvas and polyurethane films  are also locally available to manufacturers. NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk. There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. In addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, quality control standards, and labor, health and safety standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long-term. Because independent manufacturers manufacture a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers, could adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our profit margins. The cost of fuel is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins. In addition, Sojitz America performs significant import-export financing services for most of the NIKE Brand products sold outside of the United States, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Japan, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the United States, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Japan. Such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. Natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. The March 11, 2011 Japanese earthquake and resulting tsunami negatively affected our Japanese revenue and profits for the fourth quarter ended May 31, 2011, and we expect those events to continue to adversely affect us during fiscal year 2012. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, and the consequences and effects thereof, including energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our vendors and other suppliers, or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.  On March 11, 2011, Japan experienced a significant earthquake and resulting tsunami. The implications from ongoing events and widespread damage to the nations infrastructure, consumer confidence and overall economy remain unclear. Our revenues and profits for our Japan businesses were negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, and although we cannot fully assess the future financial impact of these ongoing events, we do expect our Japanese businesses to continue to be adversely impacted throughout fiscal 2012. Our success depends on our global distribution facilities. We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities, and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse affect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities. We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our reputation or our ability to effectively operate our business. We are heavily dependent on information technology systems across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and distribution. Our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these supply chain systems. Over the last several years, as part of the ongoing initiative to upgrade our worldwide supply chain, we have implemented new systems in all of our geographical regions in which we operate. Over the next few years, we will work to continue to enhance the systems and related processes in our global operations. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. Any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data, our customers or employees personal information or a disruption of our business, which could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards enacted to protect this business and personal data. An inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal risks. Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. From time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, acquisitions of new businesses, and expansion of existing businesses, such as our retail operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. However, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in acquiring or expanding a business. The failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or profitability we expect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations.  We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business. Our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of any key individual could harm us. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. The sale of a large number of shares held by our Chairman could depress the market price of our common stock. Philip H. Knight, Co-founder and Chairman of our Board of Directors, beneficially owns over 74.6% of our Class A Common Stock. If all of his Class A Common Stock were converted into Class B Common Stock, Mr. Knight would own over 17.8% of our Class B Common Stock. These shares are available for resale, subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws. The sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock. There are provisions of our articles of incorporation and Oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, a freezeout statute, two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-fourths of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company. We may fail to meet analyst expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline. Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts estimates of our future performance. The analysts estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

NIKE Brand apparel and equipment are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California distribution center, which we lease. Cole Haan also operates a distribution facility in Greenland, New Hampshire, which we lease. Smaller leased distribution facilities for other brands and non-NIKE Brand businesses are located in various parts of the United States. We also own or lease distribution and customer service facilities in many parts of the world, the most significant of which are the distribution facilities located in Tomisatomachi, Japan, Laakdal, Belgium, and Taicang, China, all of which we own. We manufacture Air-Sole cushioning materials and components at NIKE IHM, Inc. manufacturing facilities located in Beaverton, Oregon and St. Charles, Missouri, which we own. We also manufacture and sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through NIKE IHM, Inc. Aside from the principal properties described above, we lease three production offices outside the United States, over 100 sales offices and showrooms worldwide, and approximately 65 administrative offices worldwide. We lease more than 700 retail stores worldwide, which consist primarily of factory outlet stores.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_END NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells high quality footwear, apparel, equipment and accessory products worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores and internet sales, which we refer to as our Direct to Consumer operations, and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees, worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, must have products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands, and delivering compelling retail presentation and experiences. In addition to achieving long-term revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas: ##TABLE_START    Making our supply chain a competitive advantage through operational discipline, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Reducing product costs through a continued focus on lean manufacturing and product design that strives to eliminate waste, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross margin, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of brands to eliminate duplicative costs, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Improving working capital efficiency, and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Deploying capital effectively to create value for our shareholders. ##TABLE_END Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals continue to be: ##TABLE_START    High single-digit revenue growth, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Mid-teens earnings per share growth, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows, and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. ##TABLE_END  Over the past ten years, we have achieved or exceeded all of these financial goals. During this time, NIKE, Incs revenues and earnings per share have grown 8% and 15%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. Our return on invested capital has increased from 14% to 22% and we expanded gross margins by more than 5 percentage points. Our fiscal 2011 results demonstrated our continued focus toward meeting our financial goals, while positioning ourselves for sustainable, profitable long-term growth. Despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2011, we delivered record high revenues and diluted earnings per share. Our revenues grew 10% to $20.9 billion, net income increased 12% to $2.1 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $4.39, a 14% increase from fiscal 2010. Income before income taxes increased 13% for fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the increase in revenues and leverage on selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a decrease in gross margin percentage. The increase in revenues is reflective of increased demand for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel products across most businesses, particularly in the North America, Emerging Markets and Greater China geographies. Demand for our NIKE Brand footwear and apparel was fueled by our innovative products as well as strong category focused retail presentations. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by higher product input costs, increased transportation expenses and a lower mix of licensee revenue as certain markets within our Other Businesses transitioned to NIKE, Inc. owned markets. These factors more than offset the positive impact from the growth and expanding profitability of our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer business and our ongoing product cost reduction initiatives. Net income for fiscal 2011 was negatively impacted by a year-over-year increase of 80 basis points in our effective tax rate, driven primarily by an increase in the percentage of total pre-tax income earned from operations in the United States. The United States statutory tax rate is generally higher than the tax rate on operations outside the United States. For the year, diluted earnings per share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 2% decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding driven by our share repurchases during fiscal 2011. While we increased the use of working capital in fiscal 2011 to support the growth of our businesses, we returned larger amounts of cash to our shareholders through higher dividends and increased share repurchases compared to fiscal 2010. While we continue to believe that the Company is well positioned from a business and financial perspective, our future performance is subject to the inherent uncertainty presented by volatile macroeconomic conditions that may have an impact on our operations around the world. Our future performance is subject to our continued ability to take appropriate actions to respond to these conditions.

On a currency neutral basis, revenues for the NIKE Brand increased 10% for fiscal 2011, while revenues for our Other Businesses increased 8%. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, every NIKE Brand geography except Japan delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2011, led by North America, which contributed approximately 5 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue increase. The Emerging Markets and Greater China contributed approximately 3 and 2 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue growth, respectively. By product group, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 11% and 9%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues declined 2% during fiscal 2011. Fueling the growth of our NIKE Brand footwear business was the increased demand in our performance products, including the NIKE Lunar and Free technologies which are used across multiple categories. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2011 was attributable to a high single-digit percentage increase in unit sales along with a low single-digit percentage increase in the average selling price per pair. The increase in unit sales was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running, Mens Training, Action Sports and Womens Training products, while the increase in average selling price per pair was primarily driven by price increases on selected products  and fewer close-outs as a percentage of total sales. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenue for fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by a low double-digit percentage increase in unit sales attributable to strong category presentations and improved product lines, while the average selling price per unit was relatively flat. The increase in unit sales was driven by increased demand in all key categories. While wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to see growth in revenue through our Direct to Consumer channels. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations include NIKE owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through NIKE owned websites. For fiscal 2011, Direct to Consumer channels represented approximately 16% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 15% in fiscal 2010. On a currency neutral basis, Direct to Consumer revenues grew 16% for fiscal 2011 as we continue to expand our store network, increase comparable store sales and build our e-commerce business. Comparable store sales grew 11% for fiscal 2011. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: the store has been open at least one year, square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year, and the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Revenues for our Other Businesses consist of results from our affiliate brands; Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and Umbro; and NIKE Golf. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for these businesses increased by 8% in fiscal 2011, reflecting double-digit percentage revenue growth at Converse, Cole Haan and Hurley, and a low single-digit growth at Umbro, which more than offset a mid single-digit revenue decline at NIKE Golf. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for NIKE, Inc. declined 2%, driven primarily by a 2% decline in revenues for the NIKE Brand. All of our geographies delivered lower revenues with the exception of Emerging Markets, reflecting a challenging economic environment across most markets, most notably in our Western Europe and Central  Eastern Europe geographies. By product group, revenues for our worldwide NIKE Brand footwear business were down 1% compared to the prior year. Worldwide NIKE Brand apparel and equipment revenues declined 5% and 7%, respectively. Our Direct to Consumer operations represented approximately 15% of our total NIKE Brand revenues in fiscal 2010 as compared to 13% in fiscal 2009. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for our Other Businesses increased by 4% for fiscal 2010, driven by increased revenues at Converse, Umbro and Hurley, which more than offset revenue declines at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan. Futures Orders Futures and advance orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2011 were 15% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. This futures and advance order amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period, which approximate current spot rates. Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders increased 12%, primarily driven by a high single-digit percentage increase in unit sales volume and a low single-digit percentage increase in average price per unit for both footwear and apparel products. By geography, futures orders growth was as follows: ##TABLE_START   Reported Futures Orders Growth   Futures Orders Excluding Currency Changes (1)  North America   +14 %   +14 % Western Europe   +11 %   +1 % Central  Eastern Europe   +13 %   +10 % Greater China   +24 %   +17 % Japan   -13 %   -6 % Emerging Markets   +25 %   +23 % Total NIKE Brand Futures Orders   +15 %   +12 % ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (1)   Growth rates have been restated using constant exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. ##TABLE_END The reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing and because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between advance/futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Other Businesses. Gross Margin ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2011   Fiscal 2010   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change   Fiscal 2009   FY10 vs. FY09 % Change    (In millions)  Gross Margin  $ 9,508   $ 8,800    8 %  $ 8,604    2 % Gross Margin %   45.6 %   46.3 %   (70 ) bps   44.9 %   140 bps  ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, our consolidated gross margin percentage was 70 basis points lower than the prior year. The primary factors contributing to this decrease were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Higher input costs across most businesses, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Increased transportation costs, including additional air freight incurred to meet strong demand for NIKE Brand products across most businesses, most notably in North America, Western Europe, and Central  Eastern Europe geographies, and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    A lower mix of licensee revenue as distribution for certain markets within our Other Businesses transitioned from licensees to operating units of NIKE, Inc. ##TABLE_END Together, these factors decreased consolidated gross margins by approximately 130 basis points for fiscal 2011, with the most significant erosion in the second half of the fiscal year. These decreases were partially offset by the positive impact from the growth and expanding profitability of our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer business, a higher mix of full-price sales and favorable impacts from our ongoing product cost efficiency initiatives. As we head into fiscal 2012, we anticipate that our gross margins will continue to face pressure from macroeconomic factors, most notably rising product input costs as well as higher transportation costs, which may more than offset the favorable impact from our planned price increases and ongoing production cost efficiency initiatives. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, our consolidated gross margin percentage was 140 basis points higher than the prior year. The primary factors contributing to this improvement were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Improved in-line product margins across most geographies, driven by reduced raw material and freight costs as well as favorable changes in product mix, ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    Improved inventory positions, most notably in North America and Western Europe, which drove a shift in mix from discounted close-out to higher margin in-line sales, and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Growth of NIKE-owned retail as a percentage of total revenue, across most NIKE Brand geographies, driven by an increase in both new store openings and comparable store sales. ##TABLE_END Together, these factors increased consolidated gross margins by approximately 160 basis points for fiscal 2010. These increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates, primarily affecting our Emerging Markets and Central  Eastern Europe geographies. Selling and Administrative Expense ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2011   Fiscal 2010   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change   Fiscal 2009   FY10 vs. FY09 % Change    (In millions)  Demand creation expense (1)  $ 2,448   $ 2,356    4 %  $ 2,352    0 % Operating overhead expense   4,245    3,970    7 %   3,798    5 %               Selling and administrative expense  $ 6,693   $ 6,326    6 %  $ 6,150    3 % % of Revenues   32.1 %   33.3 %   (120 ) bps   32.1 %   120 bps  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)   Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 In fiscal 2011, the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on selling and administrative expense. Demand creation expense increased 4% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a higher level of brand event spending around the World Cup and World Basketball Festival in the first half of fiscal 2011, as well as increased spending around key product initiatives and investments in retail product presentation with wholesale customers. Operating overhead expense increased 7% compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations as well as growth in our wholesale operations, where we incurred higher personnel costs and travel expenses as compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 In fiscal 2010, changes in currency exchange rates had a minimal impact on demand creation expense. Demand creation expense remained flat compared to the prior year, as increases in sports marketing and digital marketing expenses were offset by reductions in advertising. Excluding changes in exchange rates, operating overhead expense increased 4% compared to the prior year due primarily to increases in performance-based compensation and investments in our Direct to Consumer operations. These increases were partially offset by reductions in compensation spending in fiscal 2010 as a result of restructuring activities that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Restructuring Charges During fiscal 2009, we restructured the organization to streamline our management structure, enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure. As a result of these actions, we reduced our global workforce by approximately 5% and incurred pre-tax restructuring charges of $195 million in fiscal 2009, primarily consisting of cash severance costs. These charges are included in Corporate for segment reporting purposes.  Goodwill, Intangibles and Other Assets Impairment In fiscal 2009, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $199 million and $202 million relating to Umbros goodwill, intangibles and other assets, respectively. Although Umbros financial performance for fiscal 2009 was slightly better than we had originally expected, projected future cash flows had fallen below the levels we expected at the time of acquisition. This erosion was a result of both the unprecedented decline in global consumer markets, particularly in the United Kingdom, and our decision to adjust the level of investment in the business. For additional information about our impairment charges, see Note 4  Acquisition, Identifiable Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Umbro Impairment in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other (Income), net ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2011   Fiscal 2010   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change   Fiscal 2009   FY10 vs. FY09 % Change    (In millions)  Other (income), net  $ (33 )  $ (49 )   -33 %  $ (89 )   -45 % ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Other (income), net is comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-recurring transactions that are outside the normal course of business. For fiscal 2011, other (income), net was primarily comprised of net foreign currency gains. For fiscal 2011, we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related net gains included in other (income), net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $33 million on our income before income taxes. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010 and 2009, other (income), net was primarily comprised of net foreign currency gains and the recognition of previously deferred licensing income related to our fiscal 2008 sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey. For fiscal 2010, we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related net gains included in other (income), net increased our income before income taxes by approximately $34 million. Income Taxes ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2011   Fiscal 2010   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change   Fiscal 2009   FY10 vs. FY09 % Change  Effective tax rate   25.0 %   24.2 %   80 bps    24.0 %   20 bps  ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 80 basis points higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2010 due primarily to the change in geographic mix of earnings. A larger percentage of our earnings in fiscal 2011 were attributable to operations in the U.S., where the statutory tax rate is generally higher than the tax rate on operations outside of the U.S. This impact was partially offset by changes to uncertain tax positions. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 20 basis points higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2009. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 includes a tax benefit related to charges recorded for the impairment of Umbros  goodwill, intangible and other assets. Excluding this tax benefit, our effective rate for fiscal 2009 would have been 26.5%, 230 basis points higher than our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to our international operations, as tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Operating Segments The Companys reportable operating segments are based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. Our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and are used to record any non-functional currency revenues or product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Geographic operating segment revenues and cost of sales reflect use of these standard rates. For all NIKE Brand operating segments, differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program. Prior to fiscal 2010, all foreign currency results, including hedge results and other conversion gains and losses generated by the Western Europe and Central  Eastern Europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographic results. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2011 presentation, as South Africa became part of the Emerging Markets operating segment beginning June 1, 2010. Previously, South Africa was part of the Central  Eastern Europe operating segment.

Contributing to the wholesale revenue growth was strong product category presentations at our wholesale customers, improved product lines and earlier shipments of summer season  products. North Americas Direct to Consumer revenues grew 19%, which contributed approximately 4 percentage points to North Americas revenue increase. The growth in the Direct to Consumer business was fueled by 14% growth in comparable store sales. For fiscal 2011, the increase in North America footwear revenue was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running, Mens and Womens Training and Football (Soccer) categories and a single-digit percentage growth in Basketball, partially offset by a low single-digit percentage decline in sales of our NIKE Brand Sportswear products. The year-over-year increase in North America apparel revenues was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in most key categories, most notably Mens Training, Running, Basketball and Womens Training. For fiscal 2011, the increase in North Americas EBIT was primarily the result of revenue growth and leverage on selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a lower gross margin percentage. The decline in gross margin percentage was due primarily to increased air freight and product input costs, which more than offset the favorable impact from the growth of our Direct to Consumer business and fewer close-out sales. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for North America declined 1%, driven primarily by a decrease in revenue from our wholesale business. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in our NIKE-owned retail business, driven primarily by an increase in comparable store sales. During fiscal 2010, the decrease in North America footwear revenue was primarily attributable to a low single-digit percentage decrease in unit sales, while average selling price per pair remained flat. The decline in unit sales was primarily driven by lower sales for our Kids and Running categories in the first half of fiscal 2010. North America apparel revenue during fiscal 2010 was flat when compared to fiscal 2009, which was reflective of a high single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per unit, offset by a low double-digit percentage decrease in unit sales. Both the increase in average selling price per unit and the decrease in unit sales were primarily a result of fewer close-out sales compared to the prior year. For fiscal 2010, the increase in North Americas EBIT was primarily the result of improved gross margins combined with a slight decrease in selling and administrative expense, driven by a reduction in demand creation expense compared to prior year. The improvement in gross margin was mainly attributable to a shift in mix from close-out to in-line sales, growth of our Direct to Consumer business as a percentage of total sales, improved in-line product margins and lower warehousing costs.

Revenues for the U.K.  Ireland, the largest market in Western Europe, grew 5% for fiscal 2011. Western Europes Direct to Consumer revenues grew 10%, which contributed approximately 1 percentage point to Western Europes revenue increase. The growth in the Direct to Consumer business was fueled by 6% growth in comparable store sales. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, footwear revenue in Western Europe increased 7%, driven by double-digit percentage growth in our Running, Football (Soccer) and Action Sports categories, which more than offset a slight revenue decline in our NIKE Brand Sportswear category. On a currency neutral basis, apparel revenue in Western Europe increased 2%, primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in our Football (Soccer) and Running categories, which more than offset a mid single-digit revenue decline in our NIKE Brand Sportswear category. For fiscal 2011, the decrease in Western Europes EBIT was driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a lower gross margin percentage, all of which more than offset the increase in revenues and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense. The decline in the gross margin percentage was significantly impacted by the unfavorable year-over-year standard currency rates. Also contributing to the decrease in the gross margin percentage was higher product input and air freight costs, higher royalty expenses related to sales of endorsed team products and higher full price discounts. These factors more than offset the favorable impact of fewer close-out sales. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 On a currency neutral basis, most markets in Western Europe experienced lower revenues during fiscal 2010, reflecting a difficult retail environment throughout the geography. Our largest market, the U.K.  Ireland, declined 4%. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, the decrease in footwear revenue during fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of low single-digit decreases in both average selling price and unit sales. The decrease in average selling price was attributable to higher customer discounts provided to manage inventory levels, while the reduction in unit sales was due to lower sales for most NIKE Brand product categories. The year-over-year decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a high single-digit decline in unit sales combined with a mid single-digit decrease in average selling price. The decrease in unit sales was due to lower sales for most NIKE Brand product categories, while the decrease in average selling price was a result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels. For fiscal 2010, EBIT for Western Europe declined at a faster rate than revenues, as the increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues more than offset the improvements in gross margin percentage. The increase in selling administrative expense was primarily driven by a higher level of both demand creation spending around the 2010 World Cup and operating overhead expense as a result of investments in our Direct to Consumer operations and higher performance-based compensation. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to higher in-line product margins, a smaller proportion of close-out sales and reduced inventory obsolescence expense as a result of our leaner inventory positions.

The growth in Central  Eastern Europes footwear revenues was mainly driven by double-digit percentage growth in our Football (Soccer), Running and Action Sports categories, while the growth in apparel revenues was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in our Running category. For fiscal 2011, the decrease in Central  Eastern Europes EBIT was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a lower gross margin percentage, which more than offset the increase in revenues and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense. The decline in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to unfavorable year-over-year standard currency rates, higher air freight costs and an increase in product input costs. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Economic conditions in Central  Eastern Europe remained difficult as most markets within the geography experienced lower revenues in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease in footwear revenue was due to a decline in average selling price, while unit sales remained flat compared to fiscal 2009. The decline in average selling price was primarily the result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels. The year-over-year decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a double-digit decrease in average selling price and a mid single-digit decline in unit sales. The decline in average selling price was primarily the result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels, while the decline in unit sales was due to lower sales in most key product categories. The year-over-year decrease in Central  Eastern Europes EBIT during fiscal 2010 was the result of lower revenues, a decline in gross margin percentage and higher selling and administrative expense. The decline in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to less favorable year-over-year standard currency rates, as well as higher discounts provided to customers. The increase in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in the reserve for bad debts along with increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations.

For fiscal 2011, the increase in Greater Chinas footwear revenue was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in our Running and NIKE Brand Sportswear categories, while the growth in apparel revenue was mainly driven by double-digit percentage increases in our NIKE Brand Sportswear, Basketball and Mens Training categories. For fiscal 2011, EBIT for Greater China grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of a higher gross margin percentage, improved leverage on selling and administrative expense and favorable foreign currency translation. The improvement in the gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to higher product prices, favorable product mix and lower inventory obsolescence expense, which more than offset higher product input costs and warehousing costs from our new China distribution center. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, revenues for Greater China were flat, primarily attributable to comparisons against strong revenue growth in the first half of fiscal 2009 driven by the Beijing Olympics. Greater China began to gain momentum in the second half of fiscal 2010, as revenues increased 11% as compared to the second half of fiscal 2009. The increase in footwear revenue was primarily driven by a mid single-digit increase in average selling price, partially offset by a mid single-digit decrease in unit sales. The increase in average selling price was primarily due to strategic price increases, while the decrease in unit sales was primarily driven by lower discounts on in-line products compared to the prior year. The decrease in apparel revenue for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a mid single-digit decrease in unit sales across most major categories, which more than offset a low single-digit increase in average selling price primarily driven by strategic price increases. EBIT for Greater China increased at a faster rate than revenue as a result of higher gross margins and reductions in demand creation spending attributable to comparisons against higher prior year spending around the Beijing Olympics.

On March 11, 2011, Japan experienced a major earthquake and resulting tsunami. While the Companys organization and assets in Japan were not materially damaged, business results for the month of March 2011 were significantly eroded by the natural disaster. As we enter fiscal 2012, we anticipate macroeconomic conditions in Japan to remain difficult as consumer confidence continues to recover. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, both footwear and apparel revenues in Japan declined, driven by decreases across most key categories. Partially offsetting the decreases was a double-digit percentage growth in revenues from Running apparel. The decrease in Japans EBIT for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by an improvement in the gross margin percentage. The improvement in the gross margin percentage was primarily driven by favorable year-over-year standard currency rates and positive impacts from fewer discounts on close-out sales, which more than offset higher product input costs and inventory obsolescence expense. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, both footwear and apparel revenues in Japan declined during fiscal 2010 due to decreases in unit sales across most major categories. The decline in revenues was reflective of a difficult and highly promotional marketplace in Japan. For fiscal 2010, the decrease in Japans EBIT was primarily due to lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense, driven by increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations, which more than offset improved gross margins.  Emerging Markets ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2011   Fiscal 2010   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change Excluding Currency Changes   Fiscal 2009   FY10 vs. FY09 % Change   FY10 vs. FY09 % Change Excluding Currency Changes    (In millions)  Revenues        Footwear  $ 1,897   $ 1,458    30 %   24 %  $ 1,185    23 %   20 % Apparel   657    577    14 %   9 %   477    21 %   17 % Equipment   182    164    11 %   6 %   166    -1 %   -3 %                 Total Revenues  $ 2,736   $ 2,199    24 %   19 %  $ 1,828    20 %   17 %                 Earnings Before Interest and Taxes  $ 688   $ 521    32 %   $ 364    43 %  ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Emerging Markets increased 19% for fiscal 2011. Most territories in the geography reported double-digit revenue growth for the fiscal year, led by Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Korea. For fiscal 2011, both footwear and apparel revenue growth in the Emerging Markets was primarily driven by strong demand in nearly all key categories, most notably NIKE Brand Sportswear and Running. For fiscal 2011, EBIT for Emerging Markets grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of higher gross margin percentage, improved leverage on selling and administrative expense and favorable foreign currency translation. The increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to a higher mix of in-line product sales, lower warehousing costs and favorable year-over-year standard currency rates, which more than offset the increase in product input costs and higher full-price discounts. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2010 revenue growth for the Emerging Markets geography was driven by growth in all product categories and all territories, most notably Brazil, Mexico and Korea. Footwear revenue growth was primarily driven by a double-digit growth in unit sales and a mid single-digit increase in average selling price per pair during fiscal 2010, reflective of strong demand for most NIKE Brand product categories in all markets within the geography. For fiscal 2010, the increase in Emerging Markets EBIT was primarily the result of revenue growth combined with lower selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a decrease in gross margin percentage. The decrease in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to lower operating overhead expense resulting from fiscal 2009 restructuring activities. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to less favorable year-over-year standard currency rates compared to the prior year, which more than offset improved in-line product margins.  Global Brand Divisions ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2011   Fiscal 2010   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change Excluding Currency Changes   Fiscal 2009   FY10 vs. FY09 % Change   FY10 vs. FY09 % Change Excluding Currency Changes    (In millions)  Revenues  $ 123   $ 105    17 %   21 %  $ 96    9 %   12 % (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes   (998 )   (867 )   -15 %    (811 )   -7 %  ##TABLE_END Global Brand Divisions primarily represent demand creation and operating overhead expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand. Revenues for the Global Brand Divisions are attributable to NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, the increase in Global Brand Division expense was primarily due to an increase in both operating overhead and centrally managed demand creation expense. The increase in operating overhead expense was mainly driven by increased investments in our Direct to Consumer infrastructure along with higher wages and travel expense. The increase in demand creation expense was primarily driven by a higher level of brand event spending around the World Cup and World Basketball Festival in the first half of fiscal 2011, as well as increased investments in sports marketing. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, the increase in Global Brand Division expense was largely due to increases in centrally managed demand creation expense and performance-based compensation, which more than offset an increase in licensing revenues. The increase in demand creation expense was primarily driven by the centralization of certain marketing production costs.

The revenue growth at Converse was primarily driven by increased licensing revenue in China, as  well as increased sales in the U.K. as we transitioned that market to a Converse owned distribution model. Revenues for Cole Haan increased 12%, driven by double-digit percentage growth in our wholesale operations as well as high single-digit percentage growth in our Direct to Consumer operations. Revenues declined at NIKE Golf, where we experienced significant erosion in our Japan business following the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. For fiscal 2011, EBIT for our Other Businesses grew at a faster rate than revenues, primarily as a result of more favorable foreign currency exchange impacts. The gross margin percentage remained relatively flat for fiscal 2011, as the favorable impact from improved product mix was offset by a lower mix of licensee revenues. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat for fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, the increase in Other Businesses revenue was primarily driven by revenue growth at Converse, Umbro and Hurley, which more than offset the declines at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan due to reductions in consumer discretionary spending in their respective markets. In fiscal 2009, EBIT for our Other Businesses included a $401 million pre-tax non-cash charge relating to the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets of Umbro. Excluding this impairment charge, EBIT for our Other Businesses would have increased 43%, as a result of higher revenues, improved gross margins across most businesses, and lower demand creation spending. For additional information about our impairment charges, see Note 4  Identifiable Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Umbro Impairment in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2011   Fiscal 2010   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change   Fiscal 2009   FY10 vs. FY09 % Change    (In millions)  Revenues  $ 11   $ (25 )      $       (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes   (771 )   (894 )   14 %   (955 )   6 % ##TABLE_END Corporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, which includes expenses associated with centrally managed departments, depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters, unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation, certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses, corporate eliminations and other items. Corporate revenues primarily consist of (1) foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program and (2) foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to these entities, which are used to record any non-functional currency revenues into the entitys functional currency. In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results include all other foreign currency hedge results generated through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, other conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, and gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to each entity in NIKE Brand geographic operating segments, which are used to record any non-functional currency product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Prior to fiscal 2010, all foreign currency results, including hedge results and other conversion gains and losses, generated by the Western Europe and Central  Eastern Europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographic results.  Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, the decrease in Corporate expense was primarily driven by year-over-year net foreign currency gains generated by our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program. Also contributing to the decrease in Corporate expense for fiscal 2011 was a $54 million year-over-year reduction in stock options expense primarily due to a change in accelerated vesting provisions that took effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and a lower estimated fair value for stock options granted in the current year. These benefits more than offset an increase in corporate operating overhead expenses, primarily driven by higher wage-related expense. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 In fiscal 2009, results for Corporate included a pre-tax restructuring charge of $195 million. Excluding this restructuring charge, loss before interest and taxes for Corporate would have increased by 18% for fiscal 2010, primarily driven by an increase in performance-based compensation. Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices Overview As a global company with significant operations outside the U.S., in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Foreign currency fluctuations affect the recording of transactions, such as sales, purchases and intercompany transactions denominated in non-functional currencies, and the translation into U.S. dollars of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our foreign currency exposures are due primarily to U.S. dollar transactions at wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, as well as transactions and translation of results denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Chinese Renminbi and Japanese Yen. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. This also has the effect of delaying the majority of the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements, the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis, to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. on a consolidated basis. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and where practical, by hedging a portion of certain remaining material exposures, using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. Transactional exposures We transact business in various currencies and have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary, both of which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: ##TABLE_START  1.  Inventory Purchases  Most of our inventory purchases around the world are denominated in U.S. dollars. This generates foreign currency exposures for all subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. A weaker U.S. dollar reduces the inventory cost in the purchasing subsidiarys functional currency whereas a stronger U.S. dollar increases the inventory cost. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  2.  Non-Functional Currency Revenues  A portion of our Western Europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. British Pound), but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency, generating foreign currency exposure. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  3.  Other Revenues and Costs  Non-functional currency revenues and costs, such as endorsement contracts, intercompany royalties and other payments, generate foreign currency risk to a lesser extent. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  4.  Non-Functional Currency Monetary Assets and Liabilities  Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, which may create fluctuations in other (income), net within our consolidated results of operations. ##TABLE_END Managing transactional exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. As of May 31, 2011, we use currency forward contracts and options with maturities up to 15 months to hedge the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including non-functional currency revenues and expenses. These are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value of these instruments at May 31, 2011 and 2010 was $28 million and $206 million in assets and $136 million and $25 million in liabilities, respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income (OCI), a component of shareholders equity, and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income), net. Ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement are not designated as hedges under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. In these cases, the change in value of the instruments is immediately recognized in other (income), net and is intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency asset or liability being hedged. The fair value of these instruments at May 31, 2011 and 2010 was $9 million and $104 million in assets and $17 million and $140 million in liabilities, respectively. Refer to Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional quantitative detail. Translational exposures Substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets and operational results of these foreign currency denominated subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries non-U.S. dollar balance sheets into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to OCI within shareholders equity. In preparing our consolidated statements of income, foreign exchange rate fluctuations impact our operating results as the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. In translation, a weaker U.S. dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues and income before income taxes was a net translation benefit (detriment) of approximately ($28) million and ($16) million, respectively, for the year ended May 31, 2011 and approximately $147 million and $33 million, respectively, for the year ended May 31, 2010. Managing translational exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and options to partially, or entirely, hedge the variability of  the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. dollar investments. This has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fair value of instruments used in this manner at May 31, 2011 was $1 million in assets and $21 million in liabilities. At May 31, 2010, the fair value was $78 million in assets. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in OCI and reclassified into earnings in other (income), net in the period during which the hedged available-for-sale investment is sold and affects earnings. Any ineffective portion, which was not material for any period presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income), net. We estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related net gains included in other (income), net had net (detriment) benefit on our income before income taxes of approximately $(33) million and $34 million for the years ended May 31, 2011 and 2010. Refer to Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional quantitative detail. Net investments in foreign subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We hedge certain net investment positions in Euro-functional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on net investments with the effect of preserving the value of future repatriated earnings. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion, which was not material for any period presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income), net. To minimize credit risk, we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration. Upon maturity, the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in OCI; concurrent with settlement, we enter into new forward contracts at the current market rate. The fair value of outstanding net investment hedges at May 31, 2011 was $23 million in liabilities. At May 31, 2010, the fair value was $32 million in assets. Cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled ($23) million and $5 million in the years ended May 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $1.8 billion for fiscal 2011 compared to $3.2 billion for fiscal 2010. Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2011 was net income of $2.1 billion. Our working capital was a net cash outflow of $708 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to a positive net cash inflow of $694 million for fiscal 2010. Our investments in working capital increased primarily due to an increase in inventory and higher accounts receivable. Inventory at the end of fiscal 2011 increased 33% compared to fiscal 2010, primarily driven by a 15% increase in futures orders, growth in replenishment programs for high-turnover styles, early purchases of key seasonal items with longer production lead times as well as the growth of Direct to Consumer operations. Changes in currency exchange rates and higher product costs also contributed to the increase in dollar inventory. The increase in accounts receivable was mainly attributable to the increase in revenues during fiscal 2011. Cash used by investing activities was $1.0 billion during fiscal 2011, compared to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2010. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower net purchases of short-term investments. Net purchases of short-term investments were $537 million (net of sales and maturities) in fiscal 2011 compared to $937 million during fiscal 2010.  Cash used by financing activities was $2.0 billion for fiscal 2011 compared to $1.1 billion used in fiscal 2010. The increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in share repurchases and dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in notes payable. In fiscal 2011, we purchased 23.8 million shares of NIKEs class B common stock for $1.9 billion. These repurchases were made under the four-year, $5 billion program approved by our Board of Directors which commenced in December 2009 and as of the end of fiscal 2011, we have repurchased 30.4 million shares for $2.3 billion under this program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2011, and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: ##TABLE_START Description of Commitment  Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31,   2012   2013   2014   2015   2016   Thereafter   Total    (In millions)  Operating Leases  $ 374   $ 310   $ 253   $ 198   $ 174   $ 535   $ 1,844  Long-term Debt   200    48    58    8    109    37    460  Endorsement Contracts (1)   800    806    742    615    463    1,018    4,444  Product Purchase Obligations (2)   3,175                        3,175  Other (3)   277    137    22    4    1        441                Total  $ 4,826   $ 1,301   $ 1,075   $ 825   $ 747   $ 1,590   $ 10,364                ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)   The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. ##TABLE_END In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. ##TABLE_START (2)   We generally order product at least 4 to 5 months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business, that are ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2011. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3)   Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2011. ##TABLE_END The total liability for uncertain tax positions was $212 million, excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2011. We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2011. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. ##TABLE_START   Outstanding as of May 31, 2011    (In millions)  Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand  $ 187  Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port  $ 111  ##TABLE_END As of May 31, 2011, letters of credit of $99 million were outstanding, generally for the purchase of inventory. Capital Resources In December 2008, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which $760 million in debt securities may be issued. As of May 31, 2011, no debt securities had been issued under this shelf registration. As of and for the year ended May 31, 2011, we had no amounts outstanding under our multi-year, $1 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks. The facility matures in December 2012. Based on our current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.15%. The facility fee is 0.05% of the total commitment. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2011, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.  Liquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. As of and for the year ended May 31, 2011, no amounts were outstanding under this program. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively. As of May 31, 2011, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaling $4.5 billion, including amounts held in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Cash equivalents and short term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency obligations and government sponsored enterprise obligations, and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, the average duration of our entire cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio is less than 120 days as of May 31, 2011. Despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets, to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where it is needed. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and inputs used, the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, and the transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy. This guidance became effective for us beginning March 1, 2010, except for disclosures relating to purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 assets and liabilities, which will be effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption did not and will not impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that revised the guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIE). This new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and requires an ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. This guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2010. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. This new guidance requires the components of net income and other comprehensive income to be either presented in one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. This new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders equity. While the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income, there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance. This new guidance is effective for us beginning June 1, 2012. As this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, the adoption will not have an impact on our consolidated financial positions or results of operations. In April 2011, the FASB issued new guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This new guidance, which is effective for us beginning June 1, 2012, amends current U.S. GAAP fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization. We do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. We do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale.  In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level  of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the assets net book value to its salvage value. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise. We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting units business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of  the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry, and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. In measuring the fair value for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain non-functional monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedge probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income, rather than net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the ineffective portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other (income), net during the quarter in which such changes occur. We use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity, to the extent effective, to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, any resulting ineffectiveness would be reported directly to earnings in the period incurred. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our  common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore, and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. On a quarterly basis, we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential  actions of third party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other (income), net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Currently, we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk ##TABLE_END In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive or negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. This also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third party and intercompany transactions. We also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. When we begin hedging exposures, the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within 12 to 18 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than 12 months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in Euros, Japanese Yen and British Pounds. See Section Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices under Item 7 for additional detail. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk (VaR). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes  and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $33 million and $17 million at May 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-year primarily as a result of increased foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2011. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $79 million and $52 million during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. We, therefore, consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows.  Details of third party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of May 31, 2011. ##TABLE_START   Expected Maturity Date    Year Ending May 31,    2012   2013   2014   2015   2016   Thereafter   Total   Fair Value    (In millions, except interest rates)  Foreign Exchange Risk         Japanese Yen Functional Currency         Japanese Yen debt  Fixed rate         Principal payments  $ 200   $ 8   $ 8   $ 8   $ 8   $ 37   $ 269   $ 275  Average interest rate   3.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   3.0 %  Interest Rate Risk         Japanese Yen Functional Currency         Long-term Japanese Yen debt  Fixed rate         Principal payments  $ 200   $ 8   $ 8   $ 8   $ 8   $ 37   $ 269   $ 275  Average interest rate   3.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.0 %  U.S. Dollar Functional Currency         Long-term U.S. Dollar debt  Fixed rate swapped to Floating rate         Principal payments  $    $ 40   $    $    $ 101   $    $ 141   $ 153  Average interest rate   0.0 %   0.9 %   0.0 %   0.0 %   0.4 %   0.0 %   0.5 %  Long-term U.S. Dollar debt  Fixed rate         Principal payments  $    $    $ 50   $    $    $    $ 50   $ 54  Average interest rate   0.0 %   0.0 %   4.7 %   0.0 %   0.0 %   0.0 %   4.7 %  ##TABLE_END The fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries.

The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews with the independent registered public accounting firm, management and the internal audit staff, the scope and the results of the annual examination, the effectiveness of the accounting control system and other matters relating to the financial affairs of NIKE as they deem appropriate. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have full access to the Committee, with and without the presence of management, to discuss any appropriate matters.  Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the company that could have a material effect on the financial statements. While reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, it does not mean absolute assurance. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatement and instance of fraud. Controls are susceptible to manipulation, especially in instances of fraud caused by the collusion of two or more people, including our senior management. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2011. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited (1) the consolidated financial statements and (2) the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2011, as stated in their report herein. ##TABLE_START Mark G. Parker  Donald W. Blair Chief Executive Officer and President  Chief Financial Officer ##TABLE_END  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NIKE, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries at May 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the appendix appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ P RICEWATERHOUSE C OOPERS LLP Portland, Oregon July 22, 2011  NIKE, INC.

NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business NIKE, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design, marketing and distribution of athletic and sports-inspired footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories. Wholly-owned NIKE subsidiaries include Cole Haan, which designs, markets and distributes dress and casual shoes, handbags, accessories and coats; Converse Inc., which designs, markets and distributes athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories; Hurley International LLC, which designs, markets and distributes action sports and youth lifestyle footwear, apparel and accessories; and Umbro International Limited, which designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and equipment, primarily for the sport of soccer. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Recognition of Revenues Wholesale revenues are recognized when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. This occurs upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. Provisions for sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims from customers are made at the time of sale. As of May 31, 2011 and 2010, the Companys reserve balances for sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims were $423 million and $371 million, respectively. Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in cost of sales. Demand Creation Expense Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, television, digital and print advertising, brand events, and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run. Advertising placement costs are expensed in the month the advertising appears, while costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is completed and delivered. A significant amount of the Companys promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. Accounting for endorsement payments is based upon specific contract provisions. Generally, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract after giving recognition to periodic performance compliance provisions of the contracts. Prepayments made under contracts are included in prepaid expenses or other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Through cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses retail customers for certain costs of advertising the Companys products. The Company records these costs in selling and administrative expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs, which is when the related revenues are recognized. This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run. Total advertising and promotion expenses were $2,448 million, $2,356 million, and $2,352 million for the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets totaled $291 million and $261 million at May 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at date of purchase. The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and equivalents approximate fair value. Short-Term Investments Short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. treasury, U.S. agency, and corporate debt securities, with maturities over three months from the date of purchase. Debt securities that the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At May 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not hold any short-term investments that were classified as trading or held-to-maturity. At May 31, 2011 and 2010, short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in other comprehensive income, unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary. The Company considers all available-for-sale securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond three months at the date of purchase as current assets within short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet. See Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Companys short term investments. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts receivable from customers. We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in other assets. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $124 million and $117 million at May 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of which $50 million and $43 million was classified as long-term and recorded in other assets. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and valued on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) or moving average cost basis. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is determined on a straight-line basis for buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years. Computer software (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) is depreciated on a straight-line basis over 3 to 10 years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The impairment test requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the Company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, the Company measures and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise. The Company generally bases its measurement of fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that the Company expects the reporting unit to generate in the future. The Companys significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: its weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting units business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. The Company believes the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of its reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within its industry; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. In measuring the fair value for these intangible assets, the Company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactions Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  The Companys global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement, the impact of which is recorded in other (income), net, within our consolidated statement of income. Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in other comprehensive income (a component of shareholders equity), debt or net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge, and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is within the cash provided by operations component of the consolidated statements of cash flows. For designated net investment hedges, this is generally within the cash used by investing activities component of the cash flow statement. As our fair value hedges are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps, the cash flows associated with these derivative instruments are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding, which are reflected in net income within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement. See Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives. Stock-Based Compensation The Company estimates the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted under the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1990 Plan) and employees purchase rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes this fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as selling and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income over the vesting period using the straight-line method. See Note 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for more information on the Companys stock programs. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. United States income taxes are provided currently on financial statement earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are expected to be repatriated. The Company determines annually the amount of undistributed non-U.S. earnings to invest indefinitely in its non-U.S. operations. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. See Note 9  Income Taxes for further discussion. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  See Note 12  Earnings Per Share for further discussion. Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and inputs used, the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, and the transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy. This guidance became effective for the Company beginning March 1, 2010, except for disclosures relating to purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 assets and liabilities, which will be effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2011. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption did not and will not impact the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that revised the guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIE). This new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and requires an ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. This guidance became effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2010. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. This new guidance requires the components of net income and other comprehensive income to be either presented in one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. This new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders equity. While the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income, there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2012. As this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, the adoption will not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In April 2011, the FASB issued new guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This new guidance, which is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2012, amends current U.S. GAAP fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization. The Company does not expect the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2011. The Company does not expect the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Note 2  Inventories Inventory balances of $2,715 million and $2,041 million at May 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were substantially all finished goods.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  The effect of foreign exchange fluctuations for the year ended May 31, 2011 increased unamortized intangible assets by approximately $4 million. Amortization expense, which is included in selling and administrative expense, was $16 million, $14 million, and $12 million for the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The estimated amortization expense for intangible assets subject to amortization for each of the years ending May 31, 2012 through May 31, 2016 are as follows: 2012: $16 million; 2013: $14 million; 2014: $12 million; 2015: $8 million; 2016: $7 million. All goodwill balances are included in the Companys Other category for segment reporting purposes. The following table summarizes the Companys goodwill balance as of May 31, 2011 and 2010: ##TABLE_START   Goodwill   Accumulated Impairment   Goodwill, net    (In millions)  May 31, 2009  $ 393   $ (199 )  $ 194  Other (1)   (6 )       (6 )             May 31, 2010   387    (199 )   188  Umbro France (2)   10        10  Other (1)   7        7              May 31, 2011  $ 404   $ (199 )  $ 205              ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ( 1 )   Other consists of foreign currency translation adjustments on Umbro goodwill. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)   In March 2011, Umbro acquired the remaining 51% of the exclusive licensee and distributor of the Umbro brand in France for approximately $15 million. ##TABLE_END Umbro Impairment in Fiscal 2009 The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible assets with an indefinite life below its carrying value. As a result of a significant decline in global consumer demand and continued weakness in the macroeconomic environment, as well as decisions by Company management to adjust planned investment in the Umbro brand, the Company concluded sufficient indicators of impairment existed to require the performance of an interim assessment of Umbros goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2009. Accordingly, the Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment assessment for Umbro by comparing the estimated fair value of Umbro to its carrying amount, and determined there was a potential impairment of goodwill as the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value. Therefore, the Company performed the second step of the assessment which compared the implied fair value of Umbros goodwill to the book value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the estimated fair value of Umbro to all of its assets and liabilities, including both recognized and unrecognized intangibles, in the same manner as goodwill was determined in the original business combination. The Company measured the fair value of Umbro by using an equal weighting of the fair value implied by a discounted cash flow analysis and by comparisons with the market values of similar publicly traded companies. The Company believes the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risk associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis, and this combination is indicative of the factors a market participant would consider when performing a similar valuation. The fair value of Umbros indefinite-lived trademark was  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  estimated using the relief from royalty method, which assumes that the trademark has value to the extent that Umbro is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the trademark. The assessments of the Company resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of $199 million and $181 million related to Umbros goodwill and trademark, respectively, for the year ended May 31, 2009. A tax benefit of $55 million was recognized as a result of the trademark impairment charge. In addition to the above impairment analysis, the Company determined an equity investment held by Umbro was impaired, and recognized a charge of $21 million related to the impairment of this investment. These charges are included in the Companys Other category for segment reporting purposes. The discounted cash flow analysis calculated the fair value of Umbro using managements business plans and projections as the basis for expected cash flows for the next 12 years and a 3% residual growth rate thereafter. The Company used a weighted average discount rate of 14% in its analysis, which was derived primarily from published sources as well as our adjustment for increased market risk given current market conditions. Other significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow analysis include the rates of projected growth and profitability of Umbros business and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of Umbro based on a comparison of Umbro to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, mix of revenue generated from licensed and direct distribution, and risk of return on investment. Holding all other assumptions constant at the test date, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would reduce the adjusted carrying value of Umbros net assets by an additional 12%. Note 5  Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities included the following: ##TABLE_START   May 31,   2011   2010   (In millions)  Compensation and benefits, excluding taxes  $ 628   $ 599  Endorser compensation   284    267  Taxes other than income taxes   214    158  Fair value of derivatives   186    164  Dividends payable   145    131  Advertising and marketing   139    125  Import and logistics costs   98    80  Other (1)   291    380           $ 1,985   $ 1,904          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)   Other consists of various accrued expenses and no individual item accounted for more than 5% of the balance at May 31, 2011 and 2010. ##TABLE_END Note 6  Fair Value Measurements The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives and available-for-sale securities. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  considering such assumptions, the Company uses a three-level hierarchy established by the FASB that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach, and cost approach). The levels of hierarchy are described below: ##TABLE_START    Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. ##TABLE_END The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most stringent level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table presents information about the Companys financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of May 31, 2011 and 2010 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value. ##TABLE_START   May 31, 2011   Fair Value Measurements Using   Assets /Liabilities at Fair Value   Balance Sheet Classification   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3      (In millions)    Assets      Derivatives:      Foreign exchange forwards and options  $    $ 38   $    $ 38   Other current assets and other long-term assets      Interest rate swap contracts       15        15   Other current assets and other long-term assets                       Total derivatives       53        53   Available-for-sale securities:      U.S. Treasury securities   125            125   Cash equivalents Commercial paper and bonds       157        157   Cash equivalents Money market funds       780        780   Cash equivalents U.S. Treasury securities   1,473            1,473   Short-term investments U.S. Agency securities       308        308   Short-term investments Commercial paper and bonds       802        802   Short-term investments                  Total available-for-sale securities   1,598    2,047        3,645                    Total Assets  $ 1,598   $ 2,100   $    $ 3,698                    Liabilities      Derivatives:      Foreign exchange forwards and options  $    $ 197   $    $ 197   Accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities                       Total Liabilities  $    $ 197   $    $ 197                    ##TABLE_END  NIKE, INC.

The fair value of these derivatives contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the forward pricing curve, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates, and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and that of its counterparties. Adjustments relating to these risks were not material for the years ended May 31, 2011 and 2010. Available-for-sale securities are primarily comprised of investments in U.S. Treasury and agency securities, commercial paper, bonds and money market funds. These securities are valued using market prices on both active markets (level 1) and less active markets (level 2). Level 1 instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily-available pricing sources for comparable instruments. As of May 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had no material Level 3 measurements and no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Short-Term Investments As of May 31, 2011 and 2010, short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale securities. As of May 31, 2011, the Company held $2,253 million of available-for-sale securities with maturity dates within one year and $330 million with maturity dates over one year and less than five years within short-term investments. As of May 31, 2010, the Company held $1,900 million of available-for-sale securities with maturity dates within one year and $167 million with maturity dates over one year and less than five years within short-term investments.  NIKE, INC.

For fair value information regarding notes payable and long-term debt, refer to Note 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines and Note 8  Long-Term Debt. Note 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines Notes payable to banks and interest-bearing accounts payable to Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America) as of May 31, 2011 and 2010, are summarized below: ##TABLE_START   May 31,   2011   2010   Borrowings   Interest Rate   Borrowings   Interest Rate   (In millions)  Notes payable:     U.S. operations   35     (1)    18     (1)  Non-U.S. operations   152    7.05 % (1)    121    6.35 % (1)             $ 187    $ 139             Sojitz America  $ 111    0.99 %  $ 88    1.07 % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)   Weighted average interest rate includes non-interest bearing overdrafts. ##TABLE_END The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet for notes payable approximate fair value. The Company purchases through Sojitz America certain athletic footwear, apparel and equipment it acquires from non-U.S. suppliers. These purchases are for the Companys operations outside of the United States, Europe and Japan. Accounts payable to Sojitz America are generally due up to 60 days after shipment of goods from the foreign port. The interest rate on such accounts payable is the 60-day London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as of the beginning of the month of the invoice date, plus 0.75%. As of May 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had no amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program. In December 2006, the Company entered into a $1 billion revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The facility matures in December 2012. Based on the Companys current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.15%. The facility fee is 0.05% of the total commitment. Under this agreement, the Company must maintain, among other things, certain minimum specified financial ratios with which the Company was in compliance at May 31, 2011. No amounts were outstanding under this facility as of May 31, 2011 and 2010. Note 8  Long-Term Debt Long-term debt, net of unamortized premiums and discounts and swap fair value adjustments, is comprised of the following: ##TABLE_START   May 31,    2011   2010    (In millions)  5.66% Corporate bond, payable July 23, 2012  $ 26   $ 27  5.40% Corporate bond, payable August 7, 2012   16    16  4.70% Corporate bond, payable October 1, 2013   50    50  5.15% Corporate bond, payable October 15, 2015   114    112  4.30% Japanese Yen note, payable June 26, 2011   130    116  1.52% Japanese Yen note, payable February 14, 2012   62    55  2.60% Japanese Yen note, maturing August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020   54    53  2.00% Japanese Yen note, maturing August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020   24    24          Total   476    453  Less current maturities   200    7           $ 276   $ 446          ##TABLE_END The scheduled maturity of long-term debt in each of the years ending May 31, 2012 through 2016 are $200 million, $48 million, $58 million, $8 million and $109 million, at face value, respectively. The Companys long-term debt is recorded at adjusted cost, net of amortized premiums and discounts and interest rate swap fair value adjustments. The fair value of long-term debt is estimated based upon quoted prices for similar instruments. The fair value of the Companys long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $482 million at May 31, 2011 and $453 million at May 31, 2010. In fiscal years 2003 and 2004, the Company issued a total of $240 million in medium-term notes of which $190 million, at face value, were outstanding at May 31, 2011. The outstanding notes have coupon rates that range from 4.70% to 5.66% and maturity dates ranging from July 2012 to October 2015. For each of these notes, except the $50 million note maturing in October 2013, the Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby the Company receives fixed interest payments at the same rate as the notes and pays variable interest payments based on the six-month LIBOR plus a spread. Each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding note. At May 31, 2011, the interest rates payable on these swap agreements ranged from approximately 0.3% to 1.0%. In June 1996, one of the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiaries, NIKE Logistics YK, borrowed 10.5 billion (approximately $130 million as of May 31, 2011) in a private placement with a maturity of June 26, 2011. Interest is paid semi-annually. The agreement provides for early retirement of the borrowing. In July 1999, NIKE Logistics YK assumed a total of 13.0 billion in loans as part of its agreement to purchase a distribution center in Japan, which serves as collateral for the loans. These loans mature in equal quarterly installments during the period August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020. Interest is also paid quarterly.

A larger percentage of our earnings before income taxes in the current year are attributable to operations in the United States where the statutory tax rate is generally higher than the tax rate on operations outside of the U.S. This impact was partially offset by  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  changes to uncertain tax positions. Our effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2010 of 24.2% increased from the fiscal 2009 effective rate of 24.0%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 includes a tax benefit related to charges recorded for the impairment of Umbros goodwill, intangible and other assets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  As of May 31, 2011, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were $212 million, $93 million of which would affect the Companys effective tax rate if recognized in future periods. Total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, as of May 31, 2010 and 2009 was $282 million and $274 million, respectively. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The liability for payment of interest and penalties increased $10 million, $6 million, and $2 million during the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. As of May 31, 2011 and 2010, accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions was $91 million and $81 million, respectively (excluding federal benefit). The Company is subject to taxation primarily in the U.S., China and the Netherlands as well as various state and other foreign jurisdictions. The Company has concluded substantially all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal year 2009. The Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2010 tax year. The Companys major foreign jurisdictions, China and the Netherlands, have concluded substantially all income tax matters through calendar 2000 and fiscal 2005, respectively. The Company estimates that it is reasonably possible that the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $69 million within the next 12 months as a result of resolutions of global tax examinations and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. The Company has indefinitely reinvested approximately $4.4 billion of the cumulative undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings would be subject to U.S. taxation if repatriated to the U.S. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with the indefinitely reinvested cumulative undistributed earnings is not practicable. A portion of the Companys foreign operations are benefitting from a tax holiday that will phase out in 2019. The decrease in income tax expense for the year ended May 31, 2011 as a result of this arrangement was approximately $36 million ($0.07 per diluted share) and $30 million ($0.06 per diluted share) for the year ended May 31, 2010. Deferred tax assets at May 31, 2011 and 2010 were reduced by a valuation allowance relating to tax benefits of certain subsidiaries with operating losses where it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The net change in the valuation allowance was an increase of $15 million and $10 million for the years ended May 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively and a decrease of $15 million for the year ended May 31, 2009. The Company does not anticipate that any foreign tax credit carry-forwards will expire. The Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of $183 million at May 31, 2011. Such losses will expire as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ending May 31,    2013   2014   2015   2016   2017- 2028   Indefinite   Total    (In millions)  Net Operating Losses  $ 7   $ 10   $ 4   $ 10   $ 91   $ 61   $ 183  ##TABLE_END During the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, income tax benefits attributable to employee stock-based compensation transactions of $68 million, $57 million, and $25 million, respectively, were allocated to shareholders equity.

A cumulative dividend of $0.10 per share is payable annually on May 31 and no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock of the Company unless dividends on the Redeemable Preferred Stock have been declared and paid in full. There have been no changes in the Redeemable Preferred Stock in the three years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. As the holder of the Redeemable Preferred Stock, Sojitz America does not have general voting rights but does have the right to vote as a separate class on the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, on merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company or on the sale or assignment of the NIKE trademark for athletic footwear sold in the United States. Note 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation The authorized number of shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value, and Class B Common Stock, no par value, are 175 million and 750 million, respectively. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors. In 1990, the Board of Directors adopted, and the shareholders approved, the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1990 Plan). The 1990 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 163 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with stock options and other awards granted under the plan. The 1990 Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance-based awards. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the 1990 Plan. The committee has the authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards, and the other terms and conditions of the awards. Substantially all stock option grants outstanding under the 1990 Plan were granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year, vest ratably over four years, and expire 10 years from the date of grant. The following table summarizes the Companys total stock-based compensation expense recognized in selling and administrative expense: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,    2011   2010   2009    (in millions)  Stock options (1)  $ 77   $ 135   $ 129  ESPPs   14    14    14  Restricted stock   14    10    8        Subtotal   105    159    151  Stock options and restricted stock expense  restructuring (2)           20        Total stock-based compensation expense  $ 105   $ 159   $ 171        ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)   Expense for stock options includes the expense associated with stock appreciation rights. Accelerated stock option expense is recorded for employees eligible for accelerated stock option vesting upon retirement. In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company changed the accelerated vesting provisions of its stock option plan. Under the new provisions, accelerated stock option expense for year ended May 31, 2011 was $12 million. The accelerated stock option expense for the years ended May 31, 2010 and 2009 was $74 million and $59 million, respectively. ##TABLE_END  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  ##TABLE_START (2)   In connection with the restructuring activities that took place during fiscal 2009, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense relating to the modification of stock option agreements, allowing for an extended post-termination exercise period, and accelerated vesting of restricted stock as part of severance packages. See Note 16  Restructuring Charges for further details. ##TABLE_END As of May 31, 2011, the Company had $111 million of unrecognized compensation costs from stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, to be recognized as selling and administrative expense over a weighted average period of 2.2 years. The weighted average fair value per share of the options granted during the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, as computed using the Black-Scholes pricing model, was $17.68, $23.43, and $17.13, respectively. The weighted average assumptions used to estimate these fair values are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,    2011   2010   2009  Dividend yield   1.6 %   1.9 %   1.5 % Expected volatility   31.5 %   57.6 %   32.5 % Weighted average expected life (in years)   5.0    5.0    5.0  Risk-free interest rate   1.7 %   2.5 %   3.4 % ##TABLE_END The Company estimates the expected volatility based on the implied volatility in market traded options on the Companys common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. The weighted average expected life of options is based on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns. The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rate in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the options. The following summarizes the stock option transactions under the plan discussed above: ##TABLE_START   Shares (1)   Weighted Average Option Price   (In millions)     Options outstanding May 31, 2008   36.6   $ 40.14  Exercised   (4.0 )   35.70  Forfeited   (1.3 )   51.19  Granted   7.5    58.17     Options outstanding May 31, 2009   38.8   $ 43.69  Exercised   (8.6 )   37.64  Forfeited   (0.6 )   51.92  Granted   6.4    52.79     Options outstanding May 31, 2010   36.0   $ 46.60  Exercised   (7.0 )   42.70  Forfeited   (0.5 )   58.08  Granted   6.3    69.20     Options outstanding May 31, 2011   34.8   $ 51.29  Options exercisable at May 31,   2009   21.4   $ 36.91  2010   20.4    41.16  2011   20.1   $ 44.05  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)   Includes stock appreciation rights transactions. ##TABLE_END  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  The weighted average contractual life remaining for options outstanding and options exercisable at May 31, 2011 was 6.0 years and 4.5 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable at May 31, 2011 was $1,154 million and $811 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value was the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of the options. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $267 million, $239 million, and $108 million, respectively. In addition to the 1990 Plan, the Company gives employees the right to purchase shares at a discount to the market price under employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs). Employees are eligible to participate through payroll deductions up to 10% of their compensation. At the end of each six-month offering period, shares are purchased by the participants at 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or the end of the offering period. Employees purchased 0.8 million shares during the years ended May 31, 2011 and 2010, and 1.0 million shares during the year ended May 31, 2009. From time to time, the Company grants restricted stock and unrestricted stock to key employees under the 1990 Plan. The number of shares granted to employees during the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were 0.2 million, 0.5 million, and 0.1 million with weighted average values per share of $70.23, $53.16, and $56.97, respectively. Recipients of restricted shares are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respective shares throughout the period of restriction. The value of all of the granted shares was established by the market price on the date of grant. During the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, the fair value of restricted shares vested was $15 million, $8 million, and $10 million, respectively, determined as of the date of vesting. Note 12  Earnings Per Share The following is a reconciliation from basic earnings per share to diluted earnings per share. Options to purchase an additional 0.2 million, 0.2 million, and 13.2 million shares of common stock were outstanding at May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options were anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,   2011   2010   2009   (In millions, except per share data)  Determination of shares:    Weighted average common shares outstanding   475.5    485.5    484.9  Assumed conversion of dilutive stock options and awards   10.2    8.4    5.8              Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding   485.7    493.9    490.7              Basic earnings per common share  $ 4.48   $ 3.93   $ 3.07              Diluted earnings per common share  $ 4.39   $ 3.86   $ 3.03              ##TABLE_END Note 13  Benefit Plans The Company has a profit sharing plan available to most U.S.-based employees. The terms of the plan call for annual contributions by the Company as determined by the Board of Directors. A subsidiary of the Company also has a profit sharing plan available to its U.S.-based employees. The terms of the plan call for annual contributions as determined by the subsidiarys executive management. Contributions of $39 million, $35 million, and $28 million were made to the plans and are included in selling and administrative expense for the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The Company has various 401(k) employee savings  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  plans available to U.S.-based employees. The Company matches a portion of employee contributions. Company contributions to the savings plans were $39 million, $34 million, and $38 million for the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, and are included in selling and administrative expense. The Company also has a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) that was adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by shareholders in September 1997 and later amended in fiscal 2007. The Company recognized $31 million, $24 million, and $18 million of selling and administrative expense related to cash awards under the LTIP during the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The Company has pension plans in various countries worldwide. The pension plans are only available to local employees and are generally government mandated. The liability related to the unfunded pension liabilities of the plans was $93 million and $113 million at May 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which was primarily classified as long-term in other liabilities. Note 14  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income The components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, are as follows: ##TABLE_START   May 31,   2011   2010   (In millions)  Cumulative translation adjustment and other  $ 168   $ (95 ) Net deferred gain on net investment hedge derivatives   50    107  Net deferred (loss) gain on cash flow hedge derivatives   (123 )   203           $ 95   $ 215          ##TABLE_END Note 15  Commitments and Contingencies The Company leases space for certain of its offices, warehouses and retail stores under leases expiring from 1 to 24 years after May 31, 2011. Rent expense was $446 million, $416 million, and $397 million for the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Amounts of minimum future annual rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases in each of the five years ending May 31, 2012 through 2016 are $374 million, $310 million, $253 million, $198 million, $174 million, respectively, and $535 million in later years. As of May 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling $99 million and $101 million, respectively. These letters of credit were generally issued for the purchase of inventory. In connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the Companys historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. The Company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings that will have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  Note 16  Restructuring Charges During fiscal 2009, the Company took necessary steps to streamline its management structure, enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable, long-term cost structure. As a result, the Company reduced its global workforce by approximately 5% and incurred pre-tax restructuring charges of $195 million, primarily consisting of severance costs related to the workforce reduction. As nearly all of the restructuring activities were completed in fiscal 2009, the Company did not recognize additional costs relating to these actions. The restructuring charge is reflected in the corporate expense line in the segment presentation of earnings before interest and taxes in Note 18  Operating Segments and Related Information. The restructuring accrual included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet was $3 million and $8 million as of May 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. The Company formally documents all relationships between formally designated hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives to either specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also enters into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, which are not designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these non-designated instruments of recorded balance sheet positions are recognized immediately in other (income), net, on the income statement together with the transaction gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from these undesignated instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, generally within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2011 are designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date. The total notional amount of outstanding derivatives as of May 31, 2011 was $7 billion, which is primarily comprised of cash flow hedges for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs.

Cash Flow Hedges The purpose of the Companys foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the Company from the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from transactions in foreign currencies, including revenues, product costs, selling and administrative expense, investments in U.S. dollar-denominated available-for-sale debt securities and intercompany transactions, including intercompany borrowings, will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. It is the Companys policy to utilize derivatives to reduce foreign exchange risks where internal netting strategies cannot be effectively employed. Hedged transactions are denominated primarily in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. The Company hedges up to 100% of anticipated exposures typically 12 months in advance, but has hedged as much as 34 months in advance. All changes in fair values of outstanding cash flow hedge derivatives, except the ineffective portion, are recorded in other comprehensive income until net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. In most cases, amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be released to net income some time after the maturity of the related derivative. The consolidated statement of income classification of effective hedge results is the same as that of the underlying exposure. Results of hedges of revenue and product costs are recorded in revenue and cost of sales, respectively, when the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. Results of hedges of selling and administrative expense are recorded together with those costs when the related expense is recorded. Results of hedges of forecasted purchases of U.S. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities are recorded in other (income), net when the securities are sold. Results of hedges of forecasted intercompany transactions are recorded in other (income), net when the transaction occurs. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from these designated cash flow hedge derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, generally within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement. Premiums paid on options are initially recorded as deferred charges. The Company assesses the effectiveness of options based on the total cash flows method and records total changes in the options fair value to other comprehensive income to the degree they are effective.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  As of May 31, 2011, $120 million of deferred net losses (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives accumulated in other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to net income during the next 12 months as a result of underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in net income. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2011, the maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted and recorded transactions is 15 months. The Company formally assesses both at a hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Effectiveness for cash flow hedges is assessed based on forward rates. When it is determined that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting. The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it determines that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item (including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions); (2) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (3) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, but is expected to occur within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified to net income when the forecasted transaction affects net income. However, if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in net income. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing future changes in the fair value in other (income), net. For the year ended May 31, 2011 an immaterial amount of ineffectiveness was recorded to other (income), net. For the years ended May 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded in other (income), net $5 million gain and an immaterial amount of ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges, respectively. Fair Value Hedges The Company is also exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives currently used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. As of May 31, 2011, all interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt and meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. The cash flows associated with the Companys fair value hedges are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding, which are reflected in net income within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement. No ineffectiveness has been recorded to net income related to interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. In fiscal 2003, the Company entered into a receive-floating, pay-fixed interest rate swap agreement related to a Japanese Yen denominated intercompany loan with one of the Companys Japanese subsidiaries. This interest rate swap was not designated as a hedge under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap were recorded to net income each period through maturity as a component of interest expense (income), net. Both the intercompany loan and the related interest rate swap matured during the year ended May 31, 2009. Net Investment Hedges The Company also hedges the risk of variability in foreign-currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges, except ineffective portions, are reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its net investment hedges within the cash used by investing component of the cash flow statement. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness based on changes in forward rates. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its net investment hedges for the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. However, this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored and reported to senior management according to prescribed guidelines. The Company also utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions either headquartered or operating in the same countries the Company conducts its business. The Companys derivative contracts contain credit risk related contingent features aiming to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Companys bilateral credit related contingent features require the owing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than $50 million. Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could trigger collateral requirements. As of May 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all such credit risk related contingent features. The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features that are in a net liability position at May 31, 2011 was $160 million. The Company, or any counterparty, were not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features. As a result of the above considerations, the Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial. Note 18  Operating Segments and Related Information Operating Segments. The Companys operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Companys internal organization. The major segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity excluding NIKE Golf. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. In fiscal 2009, the Company initiated a reorganization of the NIKE Brand into a new model consisting of six geographies. Effective June 1, 2009, the Companys new reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Previously, NIKE Brand operations were organized into the following four geographic regions: U.S., Europe, Middle East and Africa (collectively, EMEA), Asia Pacific, and Americas. The Companys NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment.  NIKE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  The Companys Other category is broken into two components for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. The Global Brand Divisions category primarily represents NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment, selling, general and administrative expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand and costs associated with product development and supply chain operations. The Other Businesses category primarily consists of the activities of our affiliate brands; Cole Haan, Converse Inc., Hurley International LLC and Umbro International Limited; and NIKE Golf. Activities represented in the Other category are immaterial for individual disclosure. Revenues as shown below represent sales to external customers for each segment. Intercompany revenues have been eliminated and are immaterial for separate disclosure. Corporate consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses, which includes expenses associated with centrally managed departments, depreciation and amortization related to the Companys headquarters, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, including stock-based compensation, certain foreign currency gains and losses, including hedge gains and losses, certain corporate eliminations and other items. Effective June 1, 2009, the primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (commonly referred to as EBIT) which represents net income before interest expense (income), net and income taxes in the consolidated statements of income. Reconciling items for EBIT represent corporate expense items that are not allocated to the operating segments for management reporting. Previously, the Company evaluated performance of individual operating segments based on pre-tax income or income before income taxes. As part of the Companys centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and are used to record any non-functional currency revenues or product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Geographic operating segment revenues and cost of sales reflect use of these standard rates. For all NIKE Brand operating segments, differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses. Prior to June 1, 2010, foreign currency results, including hedge results and other conversion gains and losses generated by the Western Europe and Central  Eastern Europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographic results. Additions to long-lived assets as presented in the following table represent capital expenditures. Accounts receivable, inventories and property, plant and equipment for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2011 presentation, as South Africa became part of the Emerging Markets operating segment beginning June 1, 2010. Previously, South Africa was part of the Central  Eastern Europe operating segment.  NIKE, INC.

Business ##TABLE_END General NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1968 under the laws of the state of Oregon. As used in this report, the terms we, us, NIKE and the Company refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our internet address is www.nike.com. On our NIKE Corporate web site, located at www.nikeinc.com, we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission: our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All such filings on our NIKE Corporate web site are available free of charge. Also available on the NIKE Corporate web site are the charters of the committees of our board of directors, as well as our corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics; copies of any of these documents will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of high quality footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores and internet sales, which we refer to as our Direct to Consumer operations, and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees, in approximately 190 countries around the world. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Virtually all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment products are produced both in the United States and abroad. Products We focus our product offerings in seven key categories: Running, Basketball, Football (Soccer), Mens Training, Womens Training, NIKE Sportswear (our sports-inspired products), and Action Sports. We also market products designed for kids, as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as baseball, cricket, golf, lacrosse, outdoor activities, football (American), tennis, volleyball, walking and wrestling. NIKEs athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on high quality construction and innovation in products designed for men, women and children. NIKE Sportswear, Running, Basketball, Football (Soccer) and kids shoes are currently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in product sales in the near future. We sell sports apparel and accessories covering most of the above categories, as well as athletic bags and accessory items. NIKE apparel and accessories feature the same trademarks and are sold through the same marketing and distribution channels. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in collections of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos. We sell a line of performance equipment under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment, golf clubs, and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc. In addition to the products we sell directly to customers through our Direct to Consumer operations, we have entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cole Haan (Cole Haan), headquartered in New York, New York, designs and distributes dress and casual footwear, apparel and accessories for men and women under the Cole Haan  trademark. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Converse Inc. (Converse), headquartered in North Andover, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories under the Converse  , Chuck Taylor  , All Star  , One Star  , Star Chevron  and Jack Purcell  trademarks. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hurley International LLC (Hurley), headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the Hurley  trademark. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Umbro International Limited (Umbro), headquartered in Cheadle, United Kingdom, designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and equipment, primarily for the sport of football (soccer), under the Umbro  trademark. As part of our long-term growth strategy, we continually evaluate our existing portfolio of businesses to ensure we are investing in those businesses that are accretive to the NIKE Brand, and with the largest growth potential and highest returns. On May 31, 2012, we announced our intention to divest of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses, which will allow us to focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands. Refer to the Other Businesses section under Item 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information.  ##TABLE_START  1 ##TABLE_END Sales and Marketing Financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in Note 17  Operating Segments and Related Information of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 60. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment. Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. We must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. Our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment. United States Market In fiscal 2012, sales in the United States including U.S. sales of our Other Businesses accounted for approximately 42% of total revenues, compared to 43% in fiscal 2011 and 42% in fiscal 2010. Our Other Businesses were primarily comprised of our affiliate brands; Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and Umbro; and NIKE Golf. We sell to thousands of retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops, and other retail accounts. During fiscal 2012, our three largest customers accounted for approximately 24% of sales in the United States. We make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price. In fiscal 2012, 86% of our U.S. wholesale footwear shipments (excluding our Other Businesses) were made under the futures program, compared to 87% in fiscal 2011 and 89% in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2012, 64% of our U.S. wholesale apparel shipments (excluding our Other Businesses) were made under the futures program, compared to 60% in fiscal 2011 and 62% in fiscal 2010. We utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit sales in the United States as well as independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf, skateboarding and snowboarding products. In addition, our Direct to Consumer operations sell NIKE Brand products through our internet website, www.nikestore.com , and the following in-line and factory retail outlets in the United States: ##TABLE_START U.S. Retail Stores  Number  NIKE factory stores   156  NIKE in-line stores, including NIKETOWNs and employee-only stores   28  Cole Haan stores (including factory stores)   109  Converse stores (including factory stores)   62  Hurley stores (including factory and employee stores)   29  TOTAL   384  ##TABLE_END NIKEs three significant distribution centers in the United States for NIKE Brand products, including NIKE Golf, are located in Memphis, Tennessee. NIKE also operates and leases one facility in Memphis, Tennessee for NIKE Brand product returns. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California distribution center. Cole Haan products are distributed primarily from Greenland, New Hampshire, and Converse and Hurley products are shipped primarily from Ontario, California. International Markets In fiscal 2012, non-U.S. sales (including non-U.S. sales of our Other Businesses) accounted for 58% of total revenues, compared to 57% in fiscal 2011 and 58% in fiscal 2010. We sell our products to retail accounts, through our own Direct to Consumer operations, and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives around the world. We sell to thousands of retail accounts and operate 16 distribution centers outside of the United States. In many countries and regions, including Canada, Asia, some Latin American countries, and Europe, we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the United States futures program described above. During fiscal 2012, NIKEs three largest customers outside of the U.S. accounted for approximately 11% of total non-U.S. sales. Our Direct to Consumer business operates the following in-line and factory retail outlets outside the United States: ##TABLE_START Non-U.S. Retail Stores  Number  NIKE factory stores   308  NIKE in-line stores, including NIKETOWNs and employee-only stores   65  Cole Haan stores (including factory stores)   69  TOTAL   442  ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  2   ##TABLE_END International branch offices and subsidiaries of NIKE are located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Lebanon, Macau, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and Vietnam. Significant Customer No customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales during fiscal 2012. Orders Worldwide futures orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from June through November 2012, were $11.2 billion compared to $10.5 billion for the same period last year. This futures order amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders and the fulfillment of certain of these futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Other Businesses. Product Research and Development We believe our research and development efforts are a key factor in our past and future success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel, and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as NIKE strives to produce products that help to reduce injury, enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort. In addition to NIKEs own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, and other experts who consult with us and review designs, materials, concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process. Manufacturing Virtually all of our footwear is produced by factories we contract with outside of the United States. In fiscal 2012, contract factories in Vietnam, China and Indonesia, manufactured approximately 41%, 32% and 25% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. We also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in Argentina, Brazil, India, and Mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. The largest single footwear factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 5% of total fiscal 2012 NIKE Brand footwear production. Almost all of NIKE Brand apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers located in 28 countries. Most of this apparel production occurred in China, Vietnam, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Turkey, Cambodia, Mexico, and El Salvador. The largest single apparel factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 8% of total fiscal 2012 apparel production. The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, nylon, leather, canvas, and polyurethane films used to make Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2012, NIKE IHM, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NIKE, as well as independent contractors in China and Taiwan, were our largest suppliers of the Air-Sole cushioning components used in footwear. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, plastic and metal hardware, and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain, retain heat, or efficiently transport body moisture. NIKEs independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. We have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements. Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed significant import-export financing services for us. During fiscal 2012, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Brazil, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, South Africa, China, Korea, and Thailand, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 19% of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those jurisdictions. Such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates. Our current agreements with Sojitz America expire on May 31, 2014.  ##TABLE_START  3 ##TABLE_END International Operations and Trade Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as possible revaluation of currencies, export and import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring. The global economic recession resulted in a significant slow-down in international trade and a sharp rise in protectionist actions around the world. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionist challenges in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together to address trade issues to reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, such actions, if implemented, could result in increases in the cost of our products, which may in turn adversely affect our sales or profitability and the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole. Accordingly, we are actively monitoring the developments described below. Footwear Imports into the European Union In 2005, at the request of the European domestic footwear industry, the European Commission (EC) initiated investigations into leather footwear imported from China and Vietnam. Together with other companies in our industry, we took the position that Special Technology Athletic Footwear (STAF) (i) should not be within the scope of the investigation, and (ii) does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an anti-dumping investigation. Our arguments were successful and the EU agreed in October 2006 on definitive duties of 16.5% for China and 10% for Vietnam for non-STAF leather footwear, but excluded STAF from the final measures. Prior to the scheduled expiration in October 2008 of the measures imposed on the non-STAF footwear, the domestic industry requested and the EC agreed to review a petition to extend these restrictions on non-STAF leather footwear. In December 2009, following a review of the ongoing restrictions, EU member states voted to extend the measures for an additional 15 months, until March 31, 2011. In early 2011, the EC declined to further extend the measures and since April 1, 2011 these restrictions have been terminated. The EC noted at the time that it would monitor leather footwear imports from Vietnam and China over the next 12 months. No new trade defense actions have been taken by the EC. On February 3, 2010, the Chinese government announced it would seek to refer the EU decision (both on the original measures and subsequent review decision) to the World Trade Organization (WTO) for its further review and decision. On May 18, 2010, the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO agreed to establish a panel to rule on Chinas claims against the EU with respect to the above anti-dumping measures. On October 28, 2011, the WTO issued a ruling in which it supported Chinas positions on a number of issues. Neither party has filed an appeal. Footwear, Apparel and Equipment Imports into Brazil and Argentina At the request of certain domestic footwear industry participants, both Brazil and Argentina have initiated independent anti-dumping investigations against footwear made in China. Over the last two years, we have been working with a broad coalition of other companies in our industry to challenge these cases on the basis that the athletic footwear being imported from China (i) should not be within the scope of the investigation, and (ii) does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an anti-dumping investigation. In the case of Argentina, in 2010, the final determination made by the administering authorities was favorable to us. In the case of Brazil, the administering authorities agreed to impose an anti-dumping duty against nearly all footwear from China, which we believe will impact all brands in the footwear industry. This decision does not materially affect us. In October 2011, the Brazilian government initiated an anti-circumvention investigation to determine whether Chinese-made products or components were subject to minimal assembly or finishing in Vietnam or Indonesia to evade anti-dumping duties on Chinese-made products. In July 2012, the Brazilian government found no circumvention was taking place and this matter is closed. Many products, including footwear, apparel and equipment, that we and others in our industry import into Argentina and Brazil are subject to the WTO non-automatic licensing requirements, which means that it may take up to 60 days for those products to clear customs and enter into those jurisdictions. From time to time, in addition to these WTO licensing requirements, these jurisdictions impose further importation restrictions or limitations. As a result, we have experienced delays in our ability to import our products or it has taken longer than the time allowed under the WTO for us to import our products. To date, our business has not been materially affected by these restrictions or delays. In the future, however, if we are unable to import our products into these jurisdictions due to these or other restrictions or if we experience increasing or more frequent delays beyond the WTO-permitted 60 days to import our products, our business could be materially affected. Footwear, Apparel and Equipment Imports into Turkey In 2006, Turkey introduced safeguard measures in the form of additional duties on all imported footwear into Turkey with the goal of protecting its local shoe manufacturing industry until August 2009. In June 2009, Turkish shoe-manufacturers submitted, and the Turkish government agreed to review, a request for extension of the safeguard measures claiming that the rehabilitation process of the local Turkish industry was interrupted due to the continuing increase of footwear imports. Despite the importers opposition to the continuation of the safeguard measures, the Turkish authorities extended these safeguard measures until August 2012, but reduced the duty from $3 per pair of footwear to $1.60 per pair of footwear. In June 2012, the government of Turkey launched an expiry review on the footwear safeguards to assess if they should be extended for three additional years (until August 2015). Together with other companies in our industry, we are advocating for exclusion of certain footwear products (STAF shoes) that cannot be manufactured in Turkey and therefore should not be subject to a higher import duty. In 2011, two new safeguard measures and reviews were initiated by the Turkish Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade (UFT) on apparel and equipment imports. In January 2011, the UFT began an investigation on apparel imports that could result in a 20-30% increase in import duties applied to imported apparel products, regardless of country of origin and with exceptions for EU  ##TABLE_START  4   ##TABLE_END and countries that are included in a cross-cumulation of origin system in the framework of the Free Trade Agreements to which Turkey is a party, subject to evidence of preferential origin. In July 2011, these higher import duties were approved and will be in place through July 2014. Together with other companies in our industry, we advocated for exclusion of certain apparel products used for sporting activities that cannot be manufactured in Turkey and therefore should not be subject to a higher import duty but no exclusion has been granted. In February 2011, the UFT began a review of existing safeguard measure on travel goods, handbags and similar accessories and containers listed under applicable regulations. One Turkish bag manufacturers association has requested the continuation of the safeguard measures through April 2014, with the application of an additional import duty of $2.50/kg (max. $3.75/unit) to $2.70/kg (max. $4.25/unit), regardless of country of origin. In October 2011, these higher import duties were approved and will be in place through April 2014. Together with other companies in our industry, we advocated for the exclusion of non-leather bags from the scope of the continued safeguards but no exclusion has been granted. Trade Relations with China China represents an important sourcing country and consumer marketing country for us. Many governments around the world are concerned about Chinas growing and fast-paced economy, compliance with WTO rules, currency valuation, and high trade surpluses. As a result, a wide range of legislative proposals have been introduced to address these concerns. We are working with broad coalitions of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors (e.g., services, manufacturing, and agriculture) to help ensure any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules, and (iii) reflects and considers Chinas domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community. We believe other companies in our industry as well as most other multi-national companies are in a similar position regarding these trade measures. In the event any of these trade protection measures are implemented, we believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature. We believe our principal competitors are subject to similar risks. Competition The athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the United States and on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes, apparel, and equipment, including Adidas, Puma, and others. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations.  NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world. Performance and reliability of shoes, apparel, and equipment, new product development, price, product identity through marketing and promotion, and customer support and service are important aspects of competition in the athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry. To help market our products, we contract with prominent and influential athletes, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our products, and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics. We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas. Trademarks and Patents We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE  and Swoosh Design  trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 150 jurisdictions. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement. NIKE has an exclusive, worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented Air technology. The process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane. Some of the early NIKE AIR  patents have expired, which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology. Subsequent NIKE AIR  patents will not expire for several years. We also have over a thousand U.S. and foreign utility patents, and thousands of U.S. and foreign design patents covering components, manufacturing techniques and features used in various athletic and leisure shoes, apparel, athletic equipment, digital devices and golf products. These patents expire at various times, and patents issued for applications filed this year will last from now to 2026 for design patents, and from now to 2032 for utility patents. We believe our success depends primarily upon skills in design, research and development, production, and marketing rather than upon our patent position. However, we have followed a policy of filing applications for United States and foreign patents on inventions, designs, and improvements that we deem valuable. Employees As of May 31, 2012, we had approximately 44,000 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. Management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent. None of our employees are represented by a union, except for certain employees in the Emerging Markets geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union, and in the United States, where certain employees of Cole Haan are represented by a union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require representation for employees by works councils (such as in certain countries in the European Union, in which they are entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or other employee representation by an organization similar to a union, and in certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into and/or comply with (industry wide or national) collective bargaining agreements. There has never been a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements.  ##TABLE_START  5 ##TABLE_END Executive Officers of the Registrant The executive officers of NIKE as of July 19, 2012 are as follows: Philip H.

Risk Factors ##TABLE_END Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Analyst Reports Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKEs business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, conferences, or otherwise, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate, or imply future results, performance, or achievements, and may contain the words believe, anticipate, expect, estimate, project, will be, will continue, will likely result, or words or phrases of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include, among others, the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products, and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products; difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for NIKE products, and the various market factors described above; difficulties in implementing, operating, and maintaining NIKEs increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning, and inventory control; interruptions in data and information technology systems; data security; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance futures orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes in shipment timing, and the changing mix of futures and at-once orders and order cancellations; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKEs products; increases in the cost of materials and energy used to manufacture products, new product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property; performance and reliability of products; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors and licensees; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in our debt ratings; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas, political and economic instability, and terrorism; changes in government regulations; the impact of, including business and legal developments relating to, climate change; liability and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the effects of our decision to divest of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses; and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKEs business and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKEs business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKEs policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE. Our products face intense competition. NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. The athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the United States and on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes, apparel, and equipment. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products and for import quota capacity. Our competitors product offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, and customer service are areas of intense competition. This, in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly. Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business. Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, as well as product innovation. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity. In addition, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. Negative posts or comments about us on social networking web sites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image. If we do not maintain, extend and expand our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profits. Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports apparel or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If  ##TABLE_START  7 ##TABLE_END we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories and lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media and online advertising. If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. We rely on technical innovation and high quality products to compete in the market for our products. Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel, and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products. Research and development plays a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to reduce injury, enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. Failure to continue to obtain high quality endorsers of our products could harm our business. We establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues to evaluate, promote, and establish product authenticity with consumers. If certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues could also harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products, or a failure to enter into cost effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sales of our products. Failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct, local laws, and other standards could harm our business. We work with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to manufacture our products, and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract to manufacture products using our trademarks. We impose, and require our licensees to impose, on those contractors a code of conduct and other environmental, health, and safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety. However, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may not require their contractors to comply with such standards or applicable local law. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Global capital and credit market conditions, and resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world. The current political and economic global environment has resulted in continued economic unpredictability, particularly in Europe where there are concerns regarding the increased debt levels of certain countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, as well as the overall stability of the Euro currency. Continuing volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets have led to a tightening of business credit and liquidity, a contraction of consumer credit, business failures, higher unemployment, and declines in consumer confidence and spending in many parts of the world. If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate or remain weak for an extended period of time, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition: ##TABLE_START   Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, increased inventories, and lower gross margins. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   We may be unable to find suitable investments that are safe, liquid, and provide a reasonable return. This could result in lower interest income or longer investment horizons. Disruptions to capital markets or the banking system may also impair the value of investments or bank deposits we currently consider safe or liquid. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   We may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The failure of financial institution counterparties to honor their obligations to us under credit and derivative instruments could jeopardize our ability to rely on and benefit from those instruments. Our ability to replace those instruments on the same or similar terms may be limited under poor market conditions. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   We conduct transactions in various currencies, which increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported financial results and condition. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Continued volatility and availability in the markets and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as petroleum) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins, and profitability. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   If retailers of our products experience declining revenues, or retailers experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, inability of retailers to timely meet their payment obligations to us, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts, and increased bad debt expense. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could reduce the availability of our products to consumers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products. ##TABLE_END Our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results and stock price. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, changes in consumer  ##TABLE_START  8   ##TABLE_END preferences, weather conditions, availability of import quotas and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix, geographic sales trends, and currency exchange rate fluctuations, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues. We make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price. Our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory, purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders, and the risk of non-delivery. We report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports. Although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues, reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of changes in revenues for any future period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, shipping timing, returns, and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Other Businesses. Our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins and harm to our business. We purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, and diminish brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance. We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers. We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products, we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be cancelled, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties, which have had an adverse effect on our business. As a result, retailers may be more cautious than usual with orders as a result of weakness in the retail economy. A slowing economy in our key markets could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers who experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products. Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk, and impair our ability to sell our products. The athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment retailers with many stores. These retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. These situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity, it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. In addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business. We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying us, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE  and Swoosh Design  trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 150 jurisdictions. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We believe that our trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success, and our competitive position. We periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in challenging a partys products on the basis of trademark or design or utility patent infringement, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products. The actions we take to establish and protect trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights. We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe their trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources. From time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately  ##TABLE_START  9 ##TABLE_END predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business. Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments, and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products. In addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets, and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs, or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings. A majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. As a result, we conduct transactions in various currencies, which increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our hedging activities (see Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ), which are designed to minimize and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently mitigate the impact of foreign currencies on our financial results. Factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts, volatility of currency markets, and the availability of hedging instruments. Since the hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities. Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing, and financing. The principal materials used in our apparel products  natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, plastic and metal hardware, and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain, retain heat, or efficiently transport body moisture  are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. The principal materials used in our footwear products  natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, nylon, leather, canvas and polyurethane films  are also locally available to manufacturers. NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk. There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. In addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, quality control standards, and labor, health and safety standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long-term. Because independent manufacturers manufacture a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers, could adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our profit margins. The cost of fuel is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins. In addition, Sojitz America performs significant import-export financing services for most of the NIKE Brand products sold outside of the United States, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Japan, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the United States, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Japan. Such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. Natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, and the consequences and effects thereof, including energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our vendors and other suppliers, or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.  ##TABLE_START  10   ##TABLE_END Our success depends on our global distribution facilities. We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities, and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse affect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities. We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy, breach, interruption or security failure of that technology or any misappropriation of any data could harm our reputation or our ability to effectively operate our business. We are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party hosted services (information technology systems), across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes and other business activities. Our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems. Over the last several years, as part of the ongoing initiative to upgrade our worldwide supply chain, we have implemented new information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Over the next few years, we will work to continue to enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. In addition, hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. Any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data, our customers or employees personal information or a disruption of our business, which could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards enacted to protect this business and personal data. An inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal risks. Furthermore, we depend on information technology systems for digital marketing campaigns and activities and electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties, such as other customers, suppliers and consumers. Our information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. Misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and damage our reputation and credibility and have a negative impact on revenues and profits. Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. From time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, acquisitions of new businesses, product offering and manufacturing innovation, and expansion of existing businesses, such as our retail operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. However, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in acquiring or expanding a business. The failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or profitability we expect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business. Our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of any key individual could harm us. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. The sale of a large number of shares held by our Chairman could depress the market price of our common stock. Philip H. Knight, Co-founder and Chairman of our Board of Directors, beneficially owns over 74.8% of our Class A Common Stock. If all of his Class A Common Stock were converted into Class B Common Stock, Mr. Knight would own over 15.5% of our Class B Common Stock. These shares are available for resale, subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws. The sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock. There are provisions of our articles of incorporation and Oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, a freeze-out statute, two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-fourths of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company. We may fail to meet analyst expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline. Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts estimates of our future performance. The analysts estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.  ##TABLE_START  11 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

NIKE Brand apparel and equipment are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California distribution center, which we lease. Cole Haan also operates a distribution facility in Greenland, New Hampshire, which we lease. Smaller leased distribution facilities for other brands and non-NIKE Brand businesses are located in various parts of the United States. We also own or lease distribution and customer service facilities in many parts of the world, the most significant of which are the distribution facilities located in Tomisato, Japan, Laakdal, Belgium, and Taicang, China, all of which we own. We manufacture Air-Sole cushioning materials and components at NIKE IHM, Inc. manufacturing facilities located in Beaverton, Oregon and St. Charles, Missouri, which we own.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_END NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells high quality footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores and internet sales, which we refer to as our Direct to Consumer operations, and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives, worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and service businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, must have products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands, and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online. In addition to achieving long-term revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas: ##TABLE_START   Expanding gross margin by: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Making our supply chain a competitive advantage, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Utilizing price increases to effectively manage the price-to-value equation for our customers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of businesses to eliminate duplicative costs, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Improving working capital efficiency, and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Deploying capital effectively. ##TABLE_END Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals continue to be: ##TABLE_START   High-single-digit revenue growth, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Mid-teens earnings per share growth, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows, and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. ##TABLE_END Over the past ten years, we have achieved or exceeded all of these financial goals. During this time, NIKE, Inc.s revenues and earnings per share have grown 9% and 15%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. Our return on invested capital has increased from 15% to 22% and we expanded gross margins by 4 percentage points.  Our fiscal 2012 results demonstrated our continued focus toward delivering appropriate returns to our shareholders, while positioning ourselves for sustainable, profitable long-term growth. Despite the ongoing challenges in the global economy, we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2012. Our revenues grew 16% to $24.1 billion, net income increased 4% to $2.2 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $4.73, an 8% increase from fiscal 2011. Income before income taxes increased 5% for fiscal 2012, driven by revenue growth and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a decrease in gross margin and an increase in other expense. The increase in revenues was driven by growth across all NIKE Brand geographies, key categories and product types. Brand strength, innovative products and strong category retail presentation continues to fuel the demand for our NIKE Brand products. During fiscal 2012, we introduced a number of innovations, including the NIKE Fuelband and the Flyknit technology. The NIKE Fuelband is a digital device that tracks ones daily activities through a sport-tested accelerometer, while Flyknit is a new footwear technology that uses advanced materials and proprietary manufacturing technology to produce a form-fitting, lightweight and seamless upper. During this time, we also expanded our NIKE + platform into our Basketball and Training categories, and launched new high performance uniforms for all 32 NFL teams. Revenue for our Other Businesses also grew, reflective of growth across most businesses, led by Converse. Our gross margin continued to be impacted by higher product input costs, including materials and labor, which more than offset the positive impacts of higher product selling prices, the growth of our Direct to Consumer business and benefits from ongoing product cost reduction initiatives. For fiscal 2012, the growth of our net income was negatively affected by a year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate. However, diluted earnings per share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 3% decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding, driven by share repurchases during fiscal 2012 and 2011. As part of our long-term growth strategy, we continually evaluate our existing portfolio of businesses to ensure the Company is investing in those businesses that are accretive to the NIKE Brand, and with the largest growth potential and highest returns. On May 31, 2012, we announced our intention to divest of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses, which will allow us to focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands. For additional details, refer to our Other Businesses section below. While we will continue to face headwinds from higher input costs and foreign exchange volatility in fiscal 2013, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term, by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.

NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of 1) sales to external wholesale customers and 2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our Direct to Consumer operations at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues do not include the estimation of sales made by NIKE Brand licensees as the amounts are not material. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4) Others include all other categories and certain adjustments that are not allocated at the category level. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  17 ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 On a currency neutral basis, revenues for NIKE, Inc. grew 14% for fiscal 2012, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and our Other Businesses. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for the NIKE Brand increased 15%, as every NIKE Brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2012. North America contributed approximately 7 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue increase, while the Emerging Markets and Greater China geographies contributed approximately 4 and 2 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue growth, respectively. Revenues for our Other Businesses grew 11% during fiscal 2012, contributing 1 percentage point of our consolidated revenue growth. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 15% and 13%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 16% during fiscal 2012. Continuing to fuel the growth of our NIKE Brand footwear business was the increased demand for performance products, including the NIKE Lunar and FREE technologies. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2012 was attributable to double-digit percentage growth in unit sales along with a low-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per pair, primarily reflecting the favorable impact from product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth across all key categories, notably Running, Sportswear and Basketball. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenue for fiscal 2012 was driven by mid-single-digit percentage increases in both unit sales and average selling prices. The increase in average selling prices was primarily driven by product price increases, partially offset by a higher mix of close-out sales. The overall increase in apparel sales was reflective of increased demand across most key categories. While wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to see growth in revenue through our Direct to Consumer channels. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations include NIKE owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through NIKE owned websites. For fiscal 2012, Direct to Consumer channels represented approximately 17% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 16% in fiscal 2011. On a currency neutral basis, Direct to Consumer revenues grew 21% for fiscal 2012, as comparable store sales grew 13% and we continue to expand our store network and e-commerce business. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: the store has been open at least one year, square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year, and the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Revenues for our Other Businesses consist of results from our affiliate brands; Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and Umbro; and NIKE Golf. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for these businesses increased by 11% in fiscal 2012, reflecting growth across all businesses except Hurley, which was slightly down for the fiscal year. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 On both a reported and currency neutral basis, revenues for NIKE, Inc. grew 10% for fiscal 2011, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and our Other Businesses. On a currency neutral basis, revenues for the NIKE Brand increased 10% for fiscal 2011, while revenues for our Other Businesses increased 8%. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, every NIKE Brand geography except Japan delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2011, led by North America, which contributed approximately 5 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue increase. The Emerging Markets and Greater China contributed approximately 3 and 2 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue growth, respectively. By product group, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 12% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues declined 2% during fiscal 2011. Fueling the growth of our NIKE Brand footwear business was the increased demand in our performance products, including the NIKE Lunar and Free technologies. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2011 was attributable to a high-single-digit percentage increase in unit sales along with a low single-digit percentage increase in the average selling price per pair. The increase in unit sales was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running, Mens Training, Action Sports and Womens Training products, while the increase in average selling price per pair was primarily driven by price increases on selected products and fewer close-outs as a percentage of total sales. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenue for fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by a low-double-digit percentage increase in unit sales attributable to strong category presentations and improved product lines, while the average selling price per unit was relatively flat. The increase in unit sales was driven by increased demand in all key categories. For fiscal 2011, Direct to Consumer channels represented approximately 16% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 15% in fiscal 2010. On a currency neutral basis, Direct to Consumer revenues grew 16% for fiscal 2011 as we continue to expand our store network, increase comparable store sales and build our e-commerce business. Comparable store sales grew 11% for fiscal 2011. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for Other Businesses increased by 8% in fiscal 2011, reflecting double-digit percentage revenue growth at Converse, Cole Haan and Hurley, and a low-single-digit growth at Umbro, which more than offset a mid-single-digit revenue decline at NIKE Golf. Futures Orders Futures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2012 were 7% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. The U.S. Dollar futures order amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders increased 12%, as unit orders and average selling price per unit each contributed approximately 6 percentage points of growth. By geography, futures orders growth was as follows: ##TABLE_START    Reported Futures Orders Growth   Futures Orders Excluding Currency Changes (1)  North America   15 %   15 % Western Europe   -2 %   8 % Central  Eastern Europe   5 %   11 % Greater China   5 %   2 % Japan   -6 %   1 % Emerging Markets   10 %   20 % Total NIKE Brand Futures Orders   7 %   12 % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Growth rates have been restated using constant exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. ##TABLE_END   ##TABLE_START  18   ##TABLE_END The reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing and because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders, and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Other Businesses. Gross Margin ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Fiscal 2012   Fiscal 2011   FY12 vs. FY11 % Change   Fiscal 2010   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change  Gross Profit  $ 10,471   $ 9,508    10 %  $ 8,800    8 % Gross Margin %   43.4 %   45.6 %   (220 ) bps   46.3 %   (70 ) bps ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, our consolidated gross margin was 220 basis points lower than the prior year period, primarily driven by higher product input costs, including materials and labor, across most businesses. Also contributing to the decrease in gross margin were higher customs duty charges, discounts on close-out sales and an increase in investments in our digital business and infrastructure. Together, these factors decreased consolidated gross margin by approximately 390 basis points. Partially offsetting this decrease were positive impacts from product price increases, lower air freight costs, the growth of our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer business, and benefits from our ongoing product cost reduction initiatives. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, our consolidated gross margin percentage was 70 basis points lower than the prior year, primarily driven by higher input costs, transportation costs, including additional air freight incurred to meet strong demand for NIKE Brand products across most businesses, and a lower mix of licensee revenue as distribution for certain markets within our Other Businesses transitioned from licensees to operating units of NIKE, Inc. Together, these factors decreased consolidated gross margins by approximately 130 basis points for fiscal 2011, with the most significant erosion in the second half of the fiscal year. These decreases were partially offset by the positive impact from the growth and expanding profitability of our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer business, a higher mix of full-price sales and favorable impacts from our ongoing product cost efficiency initiatives. Selling and Administrative Expense ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Fiscal 2012   Fiscal 2011   FY12 vs. FY11 % Change   Fiscal 2010   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change  Demand creation expense (1)  $ 2,711   $ 2,448    11 %  $ 2,356    4 % Operating overhead expense   4,720    4,245    11 %   3,970    7 % Selling and administrative expense  $ 7,431   $ 6,693    11 %  $ 6,326    6 % % of Revenues   30.8 %   32.1 %   (130 ) bps   33.3 %   (120 ) bps ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Overall, selling and administrative expense grew at a slower rate than revenues for fiscal 2012. Demand creation expense increased 11% compared to the prior year, mainly driven by an increase in sports marketing expense, marketing support for key product initiatives, including the NIKE Fuelband and NFL uniforms, as well as an increased level of brand event spending around the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. For fiscal 2012, changes in currency exchange rates increased the growth of demand creation expense by 1 percentage point. Compared to the prior year, operating overhead expense increased 11%, primarily attributable to increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations, higher personnel costs as well as travel expenses to support the growth of our overall business. For fiscal 2012, changes in currency exchange rates increased the growth of operating overhead expense by 1 percentage point. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 In fiscal 2011, the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on selling and administrative expense. Demand creation expense increased 4% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a higher level of brand event spending around the World Cup and World Basketball Festival in the first half of fiscal 2011, as well as increased spending around key product initiatives and investments in retail product presentation with wholesale customers. Operating overhead expense increased 7% compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations as well as growth in our wholesale operations, where we incurred higher personnel costs and travel expenses as compared to the prior year. Other Expense (Income), net ##TABLE_START (In millions)  Fiscal 2012   Fiscal 2011   Fiscal 2010  Other expense (income), net  $ 54   $ (33 )  $ (49 ) ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  19 ##TABLE_END Other expense (income), net is comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies, the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, other expense, net increased $87 million compared to the prior year. This change was primarily driven by a $76 million change in foreign currency net gains in the prior year to net losses in the current year. These impacts, together with a $24 million charge recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 for the restructuring of NIKE Brands Western Europe operations, were partially offset by certain net gains related to non-operating items. The combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense (income), net did not have a significant impact on our income before income taxes for fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, other expense (income), net was primarily comprised of net foreign currency gains. For fiscal 2011, we estimated that the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related net gains included in other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $33 million on our income before income taxes. Income Taxes ##TABLE_START    Fiscal 2012   Fiscal 2011   FY12 vs. FY11 % Change   Fiscal 2010   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change  Effective tax rate   25.5 %   25.0 %   50 bps    24.2 %   80 bps  ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 50 basis points higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 primarily due to changes in estimates of uncertain tax position. This impact was partially offset by a reduction in the effective tax rate on operations outside of the United States as a result of changes in geographical mix of foreign earnings. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 80 basis points higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 primarily due to the change in geographic mix of earnings. A larger percentage of our earnings in fiscal 2011 were attributable to operations in the U.S., where the statutory tax rate is generally higher than the tax rate on operations outside of the U.S. This impact was partially offset by changes in estimates of uncertain tax positions. Operating Segments The Companys reportable operating segments are based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. Our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses. These rates are set approximately nine months in advance of the future selling season based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and cost of sales for geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses reflect use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2012 presentation.  ##TABLE_START  20   ##TABLE_END  The breakdown of revenues follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Fiscal 2012   Fiscal 2011 (1)   FY12 vs. FY11 % Change   FY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency Changes (2)   Fiscal 2010 (1)   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change Excluding Currency Changes (2)  North America  $ 8,839   $ 7,579    17 %   17 %  $ 6,697    13 %   13 % Western Europe   4,144    3,868    7 %   4 %   3,839    1 %   6 % Central  Eastern Europe   1,200    1,040    15 %   17 %   999    4 %   6 % Greater China   2,539    2,060    23 %   18 %   1,742    18 %   16 % Japan   829    766    8 %   1 %   882    -13 %   -21 % Emerging Markets   3,410    2,736    25 %   26 %   2,198    24 %   19 % Global Brand Divisions   111    96    16 %   13 %   86    12 %   16 % Total NIKE Brand Revenues   21,072    18,145    16 %   15 %   16,443    10 %   10 % Other Businesses   3,095    2,786    11 %   11 %   2,564    9 %   8 % Corporate (3)   (39 )   (69 )           7          TOTAL NIKE, INC.

Our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers, driving demand for NIKE Brand products across all seven key categories. North Americas Direct to Consumer revenues grew 19% for fiscal 2012, fueled by 15% growth in comparable store sales. For fiscal 2012, footwear revenue in North America increased 15%, driven by an increase in both unit sales and average selling prices. Unit sales rose at a double-digit rate while average selling price per pair grew at a mid-single-digit rate, reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth in all key categories, most notably Running, Basketball, Womens Training and Sportswear. Compared to the prior year, apparel revenue for North America increased 18%, primarily driven by a low-double-digit percentage growth in average selling price per unit and a mid-single-digit percentage growth in unit sales. The increase in average selling price per unit was reflective of product price increases and a greater mix of higher price point products. The overall increase in apparel sales was driven by double-digit percentage growth across most key categories, including Mens Training, Running and Basketball. For fiscal 2012, EBIT for North America increased 16% as revenue growth and improved selling and administrative expense leverage more than offset a decline in gross margin. Gross margin decreased 90 basis points during fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher product input costs and lower gross margins on close-out sales, which more than offset the favorable impact of selling price increases, lower air freight costs and the growth of our Direct to Consumer business. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by 70 basis points for fiscal 2012, as both demand creation and operating overhead expense grew at a slower rate than revenues. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Revenues for North America increased 13%, driven by double-digit percentage growth in both wholesale and Direct to Consumer revenues. Contributing to the wholesale revenue growth was strong product category presentations at our wholesale customers, improved product lines and earlier shipments of summer season products. North Americas Direct to Consumer revenues grew 19%, which contributed approximately 4 percentage points to North Americas revenue increase. The growth in the Direct to Consumer business was fueled by 14% growth in comparable store sales. For fiscal 2011, the increase in North America footwear revenue was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running, Mens and Womens Training and Football (Soccer) and a single-digit percentage growth in Basketball, partially offset by a low-single-digit percentage decline in sales of our NIKE Brand Sportswear products. The year-over-year increase in North America apparel revenues was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in most key categories, most notably Mens Training, Running, Basketball and Womens Training. For fiscal 2011, the increase in North Americas EBIT was primarily the result of revenue growth and leverage on selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a lower gross margin percentage. The decline in gross margin percentage was due primarily to increased air freight and product input costs, which more than offset the favorable impact from the growth of our Direct to Consumer business and fewer close-out sales.

Revenues for the U.K.  Ireland, the largest market in Western Europe, declined 3% for the fiscal 2012 period. Western Europes Direct to Consumer revenues grew 18% for fiscal 2012, including 8% growth in comparable store sales. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, footwear revenue in Western Europe increased 5% for fiscal 2012, primarily driven by a low-single-digit percentage growth in both unit sales and average selling price per pair, primarily reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on in-line and close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth in Running, Basketball and Football (Soccer), which more than offset a decline in Action Sports. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, apparel revenue in Western Europe increased 2% for fiscal 2012. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by a mid-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per unit, reflective of higher product prices. Partially offsetting the increase in average selling price per unit was a mid-single-digit percentage decline in unit sales. The overall increase in apparel sales was driven by growth in Football (Soccer) and Running, which more than offset a decline in Sportswear. On a reported basis, revenues for Western Europe increased 7% for fiscal 2012. However, EBIT fell 18%, primarily driven by a 350 basis point decline in gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues. The decline in gross margin was driven by higher product input costs and the negative impact from changes in standard currency rates, which more than offset the favorable impact of product price increases and the growth of our Direct to Consumer business. The increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was mainly driven by an increased level of demand creation spending around the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. Also reflected in Western Europes fiscal 2012 results was a $24 million charge relating to the restructuring of its operations.  ##TABLE_START  22   ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 On a currency neutral basis, revenues for Western Europe increased 6% for fiscal 2011, attributable to growth in most territories. Revenues for the U.K.  Ireland, the largest market in Western Europe, grew 5% for fiscal 2011. Western Europes Direct to Consumer revenues grew 10%, which contributed approximately 1 percentage point to Western Europes revenue increase. The growth in the Direct to Consumer business was fueled by 6% growth in comparable store sales. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, footwear revenue in Western Europe increased 8%, driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running, Football (Soccer) and Action Sports, which more than offset a slight revenue decline in Sportswear. On a currency neutral basis, apparel revenue in Western Europe increased 4%, primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Football (Soccer) and Running, which more than offset a mid-single-digit revenue decline in Sportswear. For fiscal 2011, the decrease in Western Europes EBIT was driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a lower gross margin percentage, all of which more than offset the increase in revenues and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense. The decline in the gross margin percentage was significantly impacted by the unfavorable year-over-year standard currency rates. Also contributing to the decrease in the gross margin percentage was higher product input and air freight costs, higher royalty expenses related to sales of endorsed team products and higher full price discounts. These factors more than offset the favorable impact of fewer close-out sales.

Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Central  Eastern Europes footwear revenue grew 13%, primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales and a low-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per pair. The increase in average selling price per pair was reflective of product price increases which more than offset the negative impact of higher discounts on in-line and close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth across all key categories, most notably Running, Sportswear and Football (Soccer). Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Central  Eastern Europes apparel revenues grew 24%, mainly driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales, offset by a slight decrease in average price per unit, mainly due to less favorable product mix and higher discounts on in-line sales, which more than offset the impact from product price increases. The overall increase in apparel sales was primarily driven by growth in Football (Soccer), Sportswear and Running. On a reported basis, revenues for Central  Eastern Europe increased 15% for fiscal 2012. However, EBIT fell 4%, primarily driven by a 420 basis point decline in gross margin. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to higher product input costs as well as higher discounts on in-line and close-out products, which more than offset the favorable impact from product price increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat compared to the prior period. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Led by Russia and Turkey, most territories within Central  Eastern Europe reported revenue growth during fiscal 2011 as economic conditions in the geography continued to show signs of recovery. The growth in Central  Eastern Europes footwear revenues was mainly driven by double-digit percentage growth in Football (Soccer), Running and Action Sports, while the growth in apparel revenues was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running. For fiscal 2011, the decrease in Central  Eastern Europes EBIT was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a lower gross margin percentage, which more than offset the increase in revenues and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense. The decline in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to unfavorable year-over-year standard currency rates, higher air freight costs and an increase in product input costs.

Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, the growth in Greater Chinas footwear revenue for fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales and a mid-single-digit growth in average unit price per pair, reflective of product price increases. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by double-digit percentage growth across most key categories, led by Running and Sportswear. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, the growth in Greater Chinas apparel revenues for fiscal 2012 was mainly driven by a high-single-digit growth in the average selling price per unit and a low-single-digit percentage increase in unit sales. The increase in average selling price was reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on in-line and close-out products to accelerate the sales of slower moving apparel inventories. On a reported basis, revenues for Greater China increased 23% for fiscal 2012, while EBIT grew 17%, as revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in gross margin and an increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues. Gross margin decreased 150 basis points for fiscal 2012, primarily attributable to higher product input costs and discounts on close-out products, which more than offset the favorable impact of product price increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points, driven by an increase in operating overhead expense. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Greater China revenues increased 16% for fiscal 2011, driven by expansion in the number of partner-owned stores selling NIKE products, as well as improvement in comparable store sales for partner-owned stores. For fiscal 2011, the increase in Greater Chinas footwear revenue was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running and Sportswear, while the growth in apparel revenue was mainly driven by double-digit percentage increases in Sportswear, Basketball and Mens Training. For fiscal 2011, EBIT for Greater China grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of a higher gross margin, improved leverage on selling and administrative expense and favorable foreign currency translation. The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to higher product prices, favorable product mix and lower inventory obsolescence expense, which more than offset higher product input costs and warehousing costs from our new China distribution center.

On a currency neutral basis, footwear revenue in Japan increased 3% for fiscal 2012, as growth in Running and Football (Soccer) more than offset a decline in Sportswear. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, apparel revenue decreased 1% for fiscal 2012, as the decline in Sportswear more than offset the growth in Running and Football (Soccer). On a reported basis, EBIT for Japan grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of improved gross margin and leverage of selling and administrative expenses. The increase in Japans gross margin was mainly driven by the favorable impact from the year-over-year change in standard currency rates, a decrease in inventory obsolescence expense as well as a lower mix of close-out sales. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher product input costs. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 On March 11, 2011, Japan experienced a major earthquake and resulting tsunami. While the Companys organization and assets in Japan were not materially damaged, business results for the month of March 2011 were significantly eroded by the natural disaster. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, both footwear and apparel revenues in Japan declined, driven by decreases across most key categories. Partially offsetting the decreases was double-digit percentage growth in revenues from Running apparel. The decrease in Japans EBIT for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by an improvement in the gross margin percentage. The improvement in the gross margin percentage was primarily driven by favorable year-over-year standard currency rates and positive impacts from fewer discounts on close-out sales, which more than offset higher product input costs and inventory obsolescence expense.  ##TABLE_START  24   ##TABLE_END Emerging Markets ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Fiscal 2012   Fiscal 2011   FY12 vs. FY11 % Change   FY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency Changes   Fiscal 2010   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change Excluding Currency Changes  Revenues by:           Footwear  $ 2,386   $ 1,897    26 %   27 %  $ 1,458    30 %   24 % Apparel   815    657    24 %   25 %   577    14 %   9 % Equipment   209    182    15 %   15 %   163    12 %   7 % TOTAL REVENUES  $ 3,410   $ 2,736    25 %   26 %  $ 2,198    24 %   19 % EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES  $ 853   $ 688    24 %      $ 521    32 %     ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for the Emerging Markets increased 26% for fiscal 2012 as all territories in the geography reported double-digit revenue growth, led by Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Korea. For fiscal 2012, revenue growth for both footwear and apparel in the Emerging Markets was driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales and mid-single-digit percentage growth in average selling price per unit, primarily reflective of product price increases. The overall increase in Emerging Markets footwear and apparel sales was driven by strong demand in nearly all key categories, led by Running and Sportswear. The increase in Emerging Markets EBIT for fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage, which more than offset a lower gross margin. Gross margin declined 150 basis points for the fiscal year, primarily due to higher product input costs, customs duty charges and inventory obsolescence expense. These factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in standard currency exchange rates and product price increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues decreased 140 basis points, as both demand creation expense and operating overhead grew at a slower rate than revenues. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Emerging Markets increased 19% for fiscal 2011. Most territories in the geography reported double-digit revenue growth for the fiscal year, led by Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Korea. For fiscal 2011, both footwear and apparel revenue growth in the Emerging Markets was driven by strong demand in nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear and Running. For fiscal 2011, EBIT for Emerging Markets grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of higher gross margin percentage, improved leverage on selling and administrative expense and favorable foreign currency translation. The increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to a higher mix of in-line product sales, lower warehousing costs and favorable year-over-year standard currency rates, which more than offset the increase in product input costs and higher full-price discounts.

Revenues for the Global Brand Divisions are attributable to NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, Global Brand Divisions loss before interest and taxes increased $206 million, primarily driven by increased investments in our digital business and infrastructure for our Direct to Consumer operations, higher sports marketing expense as well as higher personnel costs to support our global brand functions.  Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, the increase in Global Brand Divisions loss before interest and taxes was primarily due to an increase in both operating overhead and centrally managed demand creation expense. The increase in operating overhead expense was mainly driven by increased investments in our Direct to Consumer infrastructure along with higher wages and travel expense. The increase in demand creation expense was primarily driven by a higher level of brand event spending around the World Cup and World Basketball Festival in the first half of fiscal 2011, as well as increased investments in sports marketing.  ##TABLE_START  25 ##TABLE_END Other Businesses ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Fiscal 2012   Fiscal 2011   FY12 vs. FY11 % Change   FY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency Changes   Fiscal 2010   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change   FY11 vs. FY10 % Change Excluding Currency Changes  Revenues           Converse  $ 1,324   $ 1,131    17 %   17 %  $ 983    15 %   15 % NIKE Golf   726    658    10 %   9 %   670    -2 %   -3 % Cole Haan   535    521    3 %   3 %   466    12 %   12 % Hurley   248    252    -2 %   -1 %   222    14 %   13 % Umbro   262    224    17 %   14 %   223    0 %   2 % TOTAL REVENUES  $ 3,095   $ 2,786    11 %   11 %  $ 2,564    9 %   8 % EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES  $ 341   $ 335    2 %      $ 298    12 %     ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Our Other Businesses are comprised of our affiliate brands; Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and Umbro; and NIKE Golf. For fiscal 2012, revenues for our Other Businesses increased 11%, reflecting growth across most businesses, led by Converse. The revenue growth at Converse was primarily driven by increased sales in North America and China, as well as increased revenues in the U.K. as we transitioned that market to direct distribution in the second half of fiscal 2011. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for NIKE Golf increased 9% for fiscal 2012, driven by double-digit percentage growth in our apparel business, partially offset by a single-digit percentage decline in our club business. On a currency neutral basis, revenues for Umbro grew 14% primarily driven by sales growth in France due to our acquisition of the exclusive licensee and distributor in March 2011. For fiscal 2012, revenues for Cole Haan grew 3%, mostly driven by growth in our Direct to Consumer operations. On a reported basis, revenues for our Other Businesses increased 11% for fiscal 2012, while EBIT grew 2%, as earnings growth at Converse was mostly offset by losses at Umbro and Hurley. Higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues negatively affected profitability at both companies, while lower gross margins also contributed to the decline in Hurleys earnings. As part of our long-term growth strategy, we continually evaluate our existing portfolio of businesses to ensure the Company is investing in those businesses that are accretive to the NIKE Brand, and with the largest growth potential and highest returns. On May 31, 2012, we announced our intention to divest of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses, which will allow us to focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands. For fiscal 2012 and 2011, Cole Haan and Umbro combined contributed $797 million and $745 million, respectively, in revenues to the Other Businesses portfolio, and losses before interest and taxes of $43 million and $18 million, respectively. We are currently in the process of preparing these businesses for sale and identifying suitable buyers. Although we are unable to estimate the ultimate gains or losses on the sales of these businesses at this time, we anticipate we will in the future incur certain non-cash charges related to the divestiture of Umbro. Upon the sale of the business, or when the ultimate selling price becomes estimable, we expect to incur non-cash charges to liquidate certain balance sheet accounts, most significantly the cumulative translation adjustment and deferred tax assets related to Umbro. At May 31, 2012, the cumulative translation adjustment was $110 million, net of tax, and the deferred tax asset was $32 million. We may also incur other cash and non-cash charges related to the divestiture of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, the revenue growth at Converse was primarily driven by increased licensing revenue in China, as well as increased sales in the U.K. as we transitioned that market to direct distribution. Revenues for Cole Haan increased 12%, driven by double-digit percentage growth in our wholesale operations as well as high-single-digit percentage growth in our Direct to Consumer operations. Revenues declined at NIKE Golf, where we experienced significant erosion in our Japan business following the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. For fiscal 2011, EBIT for our Other Businesses grew at a faster rate than revenues, primarily as a result of more favorable foreign currency exchange impacts. Gross margin remained relatively flat for fiscal 2011, as the favorable impact from improved product mix was offset by a lower mix of licensee revenues. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat for fiscal 2011.

Corporate revenues primarily consist of certain intercompany revenue eliminations and foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Other Businesses but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program. In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results include all other foreign currency hedge results generated through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, other conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, and gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Other Businesses.  ##TABLE_START  26   ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, Corporate expense grew $111 million, mainly due to an increase of $49 million in performance-based compensation and a year-over-year net increase of $73 million from foreign currency impacts. These foreign currency impacts were driven by a year-over-year increase in foreign currency net losses, arising from certain Euro/U.S. Dollar foreign currency hedges and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in various non-functional currencies, net of related undesignated forward instruments, as a variety of foreign currencies weakened against the U.S. Dollar year-over-year. The above impacts were partially offset by a slight decrease in centrally managed operating overhead expenses.  Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, the decrease in Corporate expense was primarily driven by year-over-year net foreign currency gains generated by our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program. Also contributing to the decrease in Corporate expense for fiscal 2011 was a $54 million year-over-year reduction in stock options expense primarily due to a change in accelerated vesting provisions that took effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and a lower estimated fair value for stock options granted in the current year. These benefits more than offset an increase in corporate operating overhead expenses, primarily driven by higher wage-related expense. Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices Overview As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows, such as the Euro and Chinese Renminbi, into U.S. Dollars. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio, and where practical, by hedging a portion of the remaining material exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk on a portfolio basis by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of aggregate foreign exchange exposure. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. Transactional exposures We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: ##TABLE_START   Product Costs  NIKEs product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  1. Non-functional currency denominated product purchases: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a wholly-owned centralized sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from external factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from external factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  2. Factory input costs: In January 2012, NIKE implemented a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories and is recognized in cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivatives and are recorded at fair value through other expense (income), net. Refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives for additional detail. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKEs U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales  A portion of our Western Europe and Central  Eastern Europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. British Pound, Polish Zloty) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Other Costs  Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, intercompany royalties and other intercompany charges, generate foreign currency risk to a lesser extent. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities  Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, which may create fluctuations in other expense (income), net within our consolidated results of operations. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  27 ##TABLE_END Managing transactional exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. These are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product costs exposure as discussed below. As of May 31, 2012, there were outstanding currency forward contracts with maturities up to 24 months. The fair value of outstanding currency forward contracts at May 31, 2012 and 2011 was $183 million and $28 million in assets and $32 million and $136 million in liabilities, respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income (OCI), a component of shareholders equity, and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect consolidated earnings. The ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other expense (income), net. Ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in other expense (income), net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. The fair value of undesignated instruments was $55 million and $9 million in assets and $20 million and $17 million in liabilities at May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements and Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded. Translational exposures Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to OCI within shareholders equity. In the translation of our consolidated statements of income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues was a benefit (detriment) of approximately $268 million and $(28) million for the years ended May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes was a benefit (detriment) of approximately $74 million and $(16) million for the years ended May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Managing translational exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fair value of instruments used in this manner at May 31, 2012 and 2011 was $27 million and $1 million in assets and $3 million and $21 million in liabilities, respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in OCI and reclassified into earnings in other expense (income), net in the period during which the hedged available-for-sale investment is sold and affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other expense (income), net. The impact of ineffective hedges was not material for any period presented. The combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense (income), net had an insignificant impact on our income before income taxes for the year ended May 31, 2012 and had a unfavorable impact of approximately $33 million for the year ended May 31, 2011. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements and Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded. Net investments in foreign subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We hedge certain net investment positions in Euro-functional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other expense (income), net. The impact of ineffective hedges was not material for any period presented. To minimize credit risk, we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration. Upon maturity, the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in OCI. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2012. At May 31, 2011, the fair value was $23 million in liabilities. Cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled $22 million and $(23) million for the years ended May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  ##TABLE_START  28   ##TABLE_END Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $1.9 billion for fiscal 2012 compared to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2011. Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2012 was net income of $2.2 billion. Our working capital was a net cash outflow of $799 million for fiscal 2012 as compared to a net cash outflow of $708 million for fiscal 2011. Our investments in working capital increased primarily due to an increase in inventory and prepaid expenses. Inventory at the end of fiscal 2012 increased 23% compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to higher product input costs as well as changes in product mix, which more than offset the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Inventory units for the NIKE Brand grew 10% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in futures orders and improved factory deliveries. The increase in prepaid expenses was primarily driven by higher prepaid demand creation expenses around the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. Cash provided by investing activities was $514 million during fiscal 2012, compared to a use of cash of $1,021 million for fiscal 2011. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $1,124 million (net of purchases) in fiscal 2012, compared to net purchases of $537 million (net of sales and maturities) during fiscal 2011. Cash used by financing activities was $2.1 billion for fiscal 2012 compared to $2.0 billion for fiscal 2011. The increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to higher payments of long-term debt, notes payable, and dividends, which was partially offset by an increase in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options. In fiscal 2012, we purchased 20.0 million shares of NIKEs class B common stock for $1.8 billion. These repurchases were made under the four-year, $5 billion program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2008, under which stock repurchase activities commenced in December 2009. As of the end of fiscal 2012, we have repurchased 50.3 million shares for $4.1 billion under this program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Capital Resources On November 1, 2011, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings pursuant to a revolving credit facility with the option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billon with lender approval. The facility matures in November 2016, with a one-year extension option prior to both the second and third anniversary of the closing date, provided that extensions shall not extend beyond November 1, 2018. This facility replaces the prior $1 billion committed credit facility agreement that would have expired in December 2012. As of and for the year ended May 31, 2012, we had no amounts outstanding under our new committed revolving credit facility. We currently have long-term debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed revolving credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2012, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. As of and for the year ended May 31, 2012, no amounts were outstanding under this program. We may issue commercial paper from time to time during fiscal 2013 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively. Our previous $760 million shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission expired during fiscal 2012. No debt securities were issued under that shelf registration prior to its expiry. We may issue debt securities under a new shelf registration in fiscal 2013 depending on general corporate needs. As of May 31, 2012, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $3.8 billion, of which $2.5 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, the average duration of our entire cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolio is less than 120 days as of May 31, 2012. Despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets, to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the U.S., we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the U.S. through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the U.S. through debt, we would incur additional interest expense. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations.  ##TABLE_START  29 ##TABLE_END Contractual Obligations Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2012 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: ##TABLE_START Description of Commitment  Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31,  (In millions)  2013   2014   2015   2016   2017   Thereafter   Total  Operating Leases  $ 408   $ 387   $ 271   $ 224   $ 186   $ 662   $ 2,138  Long-term Debt   49    59    9    109    9    27    262  Endorsement Contracts (1)   856    804    686    491    363    628    3,828  Product Purchase Obligations (2)   2,861                        2,861  Other (3)   320    101    38    31    91    1    582  TOTAL  $ 4,494   $ 1,351   $ 1,004   $ 855   $ 649   $ 1,318   $ 9,671  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) We generally order product at least 4 to 5 months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2012. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2012. ##TABLE_END The total liability for uncertain tax positions was $285 million, excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2012. We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2012. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. ##TABLE_START (In millions)  Outstanding as of May 31, 2012  Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand  $ 108  Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port  $ 75  ##TABLE_END As of May 31, 2012, letters of credit of $138 million were outstanding, which were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Companys performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In April 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This new guidance, which became effective for us beginning March 1, 2012, amends current U.S. GAAP fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and inputs used, the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, and the transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy. This guidance became effective for us beginning March 1, 2010, except for disclosures relating to purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 assets and liabilities, which became effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards became effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  ##TABLE_START  30   ##TABLE_END Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entitys right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. This new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements. This new guidance is effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2011, the FASB issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment. This guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards. This new guidance is effective for us beginning June 1, 2012. We do not expect the adoption will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. This new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders equity. Companies will now be required to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. This guidance also required companies to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. However, in December 2011, the FASB issued guidance which indefinitely defers the requirement related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. Both issuances on the presentation of comprehensive income are effective for us beginning June 1, 2012. As this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers, and estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales.  ##TABLE_START  31 ##TABLE_END Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the assets net book value to its salvage value. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value if any. We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting units business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. In measuring the fair value for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. On May 31, 2012, we announced our intention to divest of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses. As of May 31, 2012, Cole Haan had no goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet, while Umbro had $70 million of goodwill and $164 million of trademark and other intangible assets. As of May 31, 2012, both asset groups for Cole Haan and Umbro did not quality as assets-held-for-sale under applicable accounting guidance. The decision to divest these businesses was deemed a triggering event to perform an impairment analysis of Umbros intangible assets at that date and was considered in our fourth quarter impairment analysis. We are currently in the process of preparing the businesses for divestiture and identifying potential acquirers. Therefore, we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of the Umbro reporting unit because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis. As discussed above, the asset groups for Umbro did not qualify as assets-held-for-sale; therefore, we did not consider potential disposition costs or cumulative translation adjustments in the carrying value of the Umbro reporting unit in our fiscal 2012 fourth quarter impairment analysis. Because we are still in the preliminary stages of the divestiture process and have not yet identified potential acquirers or the likely deal structure, these methods represent our best estimate of the fair value of the Umbro business. Our analysis determined there was no impairment of intangible assets or goodwill related to Umbro. If the sales process indicates a fair value that is below the current carrying value of the reporting unit, an analysis would be required to determine if impairment charges exist at that point.  ##TABLE_START  32   ##TABLE_END Fair Value Measurements For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, including U.S. Treasury securities. In the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as commercial paper and bonds, U.S. agency securities and money market funds. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our available-for-sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments, as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include an analysis of period-over-period fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain non-functional monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income, rather than net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in fair values of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income to other expense (income), net during the quarter in which such changes occur. We use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity, to the extent effective, to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported directly to earnings in the period in which changes occur. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. On a quarterly basis, we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.  ##TABLE_START  33 ##TABLE_END Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other expense (income), net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  ##TABLE_START  34   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk ##TABLE_END In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons. When we begin hedging exposures, the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within 12 to 18 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than 12 months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. See section Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices under Item 7 for additional detail. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk (VaR). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $21 million and $33 million at May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The VaR decreased year-over-year primarily as a result of decreased foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2012. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $87 million and $79 million during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, respectively. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows. Details of third-party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of May 31, 2012.  ##TABLE_START  35 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Expected Maturity Date Year Ending May 31,  (Dollars in millions)  2013   2014   2015   2016   2017   Thereafter   Total   Fair Value  Foreign Exchange Risk         Japanese Yen Functional Currency         Japanese Yen debt  Fixed rate         Principal payments  $ 9   $ 9   $ 9   $ 9   $ 9   $ 27   $ 72   $ 76  Average interest rate   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %  Interest Rate Risk         Japanese Yen Functional Currency         Long-term Japanese Yen debt  Fixed rate         Principal payments  $ 9   $ 9   $ 9   $ 9   $ 9   $ 27   $ 72   $ 76  Average interest rate   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %   2.4 %  U.S. Dollar Functional Currency         Long-term U.S. Dollar debt  Fixed rate swapped to Floating rate         Principal payments  $ 40   $    $    $ 100   $    $    $ 140   $ 154  Average interest rate   0.8 %   0.0 %   0.0 %   0.7 %   0.0 %   0.0 %   0.7 %  Long-term U.S. Dollar debt  Fixed rate         Principal payments  $    $ 50   $    $    $    $    $ 50   $ 53  Average interest rate   0.0 %   4.7 %   0.0 %   0.0 %   0.0 %   0.0 %   4.7 %     ##TABLE_END The fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect on the financial statements. While reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, it does not mean absolute assurance. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatement and instance of fraud. Controls are susceptible to manipulation, especially in instances of fraud caused by the collusion of two or more people, including our senior management. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2012. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited (1) the consolidated financial statements and (2) the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2012, as stated in their report herein. ##TABLE_START Mark G.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the appendix appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. / S / P RICEWATERHOUSE C OOPERS LLP Portland, Oregon July 24, 2012  ##TABLE_START  38   ##TABLE_END Consolidated Statements Of Income ##TABLE_START

NIKE, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design, marketing and distribution of athletic and sports-inspired footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. Wholly-owned NIKE subsidiaries include Cole Haan, which designs, markets and distributes dress and casual shoes, handbags, accessories and coats; Converse Inc., which designs, markets and distributes athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories; Hurley International LLC, which designs, markets and distributes action sports and youth lifestyle footwear, apparel and accessories; and Umbro International Limited, which designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and equipment, primarily for the sport of football (soccer). Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Recognition of Revenues Wholesale revenues are recognized when title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. This occurs upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. Provisions for sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims from customers are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale. As of May 31, 2012 and 2011, the Companys reserve balances for sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims were $480 million and $423 million, respectively. Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in cost of sales. Demand Creation Expense Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, television, digital and print advertising, brand events, and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run. Advertising placement costs are expensed in the month the advertising appears, while costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is completed and delivered. A significant amount of the Companys promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. Accounting for endorsement payments is based upon specific contract provisions. Generally, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract after giving recognition to periodic performance compliance provisions of the contracts. Prepayments made under contracts are included in prepaid expenses or other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). The Company records selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are recorded in selling and administrative expense when the Company determines that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be recorded in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. The Company expenses these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, the Company offers minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which the Company estimates it will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, the Company records the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Through cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses retail customers for certain costs of advertising the Companys products. The Company records these costs in selling and administrative expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs, which is when the related revenues are recognized. This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run. Total advertising and promotion expenses were $2,711 million, $2,448 million, and $2,356 million for the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets totaled $309 million and $291 million at May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at date of purchase. The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and equivalents approximate fair value. Short-Term Investments Short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. treasury, U.S. agency, and corporate debt securities, with maturities over three months from the date of purchase. Debt securities that the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At May 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company did not hold any short-term investments that were classified as trading or held-to-maturity. At May 31, 2012 and 2011, short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in other comprehensive income, unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond three months at the date of purchase as current assets within short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Companys short-term investments. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts receivable from customers. We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of our  ##TABLE_START  45 ##TABLE_END accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in other assets. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $95 million and $124 million at May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, of which $45 million and $50 million, respectively, was classified as long-term and recorded in other assets. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and valued on an average cost basis. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is determined on a straight-line basis for buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years. Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in cost of sales. Depreciation and amortization of other assets are recorded in selling and administrative expense. Software Development Costs Internal Use Software . Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 10 year period on a straight-line basis. The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed . Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The impairment test requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the Company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, the Company measures and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value if any. The Company generally bases its measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that the Company expects the reporting unit to generate in the future. The Companys significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: its weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting units business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. In measuring the fair value for these intangible assets, the Company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. On May 31, 2012, the Company announced its intention to divest of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses. As of May 31, 2012, Cole Haan had no goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets on the Companys balance sheet, while Umbro had $70 million of goodwill and $164 million of trademark and other intangible assets. As of May 31, 2012, both asset groups for Cole Haan and Umbro did not quality as assets-held-for-sale under applicable accounting guidance. The decision to divest these businesses was deemed a triggering event to perform an impairment analysis of Umbros intangible assets at that date and was considered in the Companys fourth quarter impairment analysis. The Company is currently in the process of preparing the businesses for divestiture and identifying potential acquirers. Therefore, the Company believes the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of the Umbro reporting unit because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within its industry; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis. As discussed above, the asset groups for Umbro did not qualify as assets-held-for-sale; therefore, the Company did not consider potential disposition costs or cumulative translation adjustments in the carrying value of the Umbro reporting unit in its fiscal 2012 fourth quarter impairment analysis. Because the Company is still in the preliminary stages of  ##TABLE_START  46   ##TABLE_END the divestiture process and has not yet identified potential acquirers or the likely deal structure, these methods represent managements best estimate of the fair value of the Umbro business. The Companys analysis determined there was no impairment of intangible assets or goodwill related to Umbro. If the sales process indicates a fair value that is below the current carrying value of the reporting unit, an analysis would be required to determine if impairment charges exist at that point. Operating Leases The Company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities and office space under operating leases. Operating lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. Rent expense for non-cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, beginning with the effective lease commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Certain leases also provide for contingent rents, which are determined as a percentage of sales in excess of specified levels. A contingent rent liability is recognized together with the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable. Fair Value Measurements The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives and available-for-sale securities. Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level hierarchy established by the FASB that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach, and cost approach). The levels of hierarchy are described below: ##TABLE_START   Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. ##TABLE_END The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Pricing vendors are utilized for certain Level 1 or Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The Companys fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include an analysis of period-over-period fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for additional information. Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactions Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. The Companys global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement, the impact of which is recorded in other expense (income), net, within the consolidated statements of income. Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in other comprehensive income (a component of shareholders equity), debt or net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge, and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is within the cash provided by operations component of the consolidated statements of cash flows. For designated net investment hedges, this is generally within the cash provided or used by investing activities component of the cash flow statement. As our fair value hedges are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps, the cash flows associated with these derivative instruments are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding. These cash flows are reflected within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement. See Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives. Stock-Based Compensation The Company estimates the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted under the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1990 Plan) and employees purchase rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes this fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as selling and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income over the vesting period using the straight-line method. See Note 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for more information on the Companys stock programs. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. United States income taxes are provided currently on financial statement earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are expected to be repatriated. The Company determines annually the amount of undistributed non-U.S. earnings to invest indefinitely in its non-U.S. operations. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. See Note 9  Income Taxes for further discussion.  ##TABLE_START  47 ##TABLE_END Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards. See Note 12  Earnings Per Share for further discussion. Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In April 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This new guidance, which became effective for the Company beginning March 1, 2012, amends current U.S. GAAP fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and inputs used, the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, and the transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy (as described in Note 6. Fair Value Measurements). This guidance became effective for the Company beginning March 1, 2010, except for disclosures relating to purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 assets and liabilities, which became effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2011. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards became effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2011. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entitys right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. This new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the Company does not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2011, the FASB issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment. This guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2012. The Company does not expect the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. This new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders equity. Companies will now be required to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. This guidance also required companies to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. However, in December 2011, the FASB issued guidance which indefinitely defers the requirement related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. Both issuances on the presentation of comprehensive income are effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2012. As this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, the Company does not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. ##TABLE_START NOTE 2  Inventories  ##TABLE_END Inventory balances of $3,350 million and $2,715 million at May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were substantially all finished goods.  ##TABLE_START  48   ##TABLE_END NOTE 3  Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment included the following: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31,  (In millions)   2012    2011  Land  $ 252   $ 237  Buildings   1,158    1,124  Machinery, equipment and internal-use software   2,755    2,487  Leasehold improvements   968    931  Construction in process   111    127  Total property, plant and equipment, gross   5,244    4,906  Less accumulated depreciation   2,965    2,791  TOTAL PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET  $ 2,279   $ 2,115  ##TABLE_END Capitalized interest was not material for the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010.

The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates, and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and that of its counterparties. Adjustments relating to these nonperformance risks were not material at May 31, 2012 or 2011. Refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives for additional detail. Available-for-sale securities are comprised of investments in U.S. Treasury and agency securities, money market funds, corporate commercial paper and bonds. These securities are valued using market prices on both active markets (Level 1) and less active markets (Level 2). Pricing vendors are utilized for certain Level 1 or Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The Companys Level 3 assets are comprised of investments in certain non-marketable preferred stock. These investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. These Level 3 investments are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. Changes in Level 3 investment assets were immaterial during the year ended May 31, 2012. As of May 31, 2011, the Company had no Level 3 assets and liabilities. No transfers among the levels within the fair value hierarchy occurred during the years ended May 31, 2012 or 2011. As of May 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had no assets or liabilities that were required to be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Short-Term Investments As of May 31, 2012 and 2011, short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale securities. As of May 31, 2012, the Company held $1,129 million of available-for-sale securities with maturity dates within one year from purchase date and $311 million with maturity dates over one year and less than five years from purchase date within short-term investments. As of May 31, 2011, the Company held $2,253 million of available-for-sale securities with maturity dates within one year from purchase date and $330 million with maturity dates over one year and less than five years from purchase date within short-term investments.  Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale consist of the following at fair value: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31,  (In millions)   2012    2011  Available-for-sale investments:      U.S. treasury and agencies  $ 1,157   $ 1,781  Commercial paper and bonds   283    802  TOTAL AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS  $ 1,440   $ 2,583  ##TABLE_END Included in interest expense, net was interest income of $30 million for each of the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, related to cash and equivalents and short-term investments. For fair value information regarding notes payable and long-term debt, refer to Note 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines and Note 8  Long-Term Debt.  ##TABLE_START  51 ##TABLE_END NOTE 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines Notes payable and interest-bearing accounts payable to Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America) as of May 31, 2012 and 2011, are summarized below: ##TABLE_START   May 31,    2012   2011  (In millions)  Borrowings   Interest Rate   Borrowings   Interest Rate  Notes payable:           U.S. operations   30    5.50 % (1)    35    0.00 % (1)  Non-U.S. operations   78    9.46 % (1)    152    7.05 % (1)  TOTAL NOTES PAYABLE  $ 108       $ 187      Interest-Bearing Accounts Payable:           Sojitz America  $ 75    1.10 %  $ 111    0.99 % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Weighted average interest rate includes non-interest bearing overdrafts. ##TABLE_END The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for notes payable approximate fair value. The Company purchases through Sojitz America certain athletic footwear, apparel and equipment it acquires from non-U.S. suppliers. These purchases are for the Companys operations outside of the United States, Europe and Japan. Accounts payable to Sojitz America are generally due up to 60 days after shipment of goods from the foreign port. The interest rate on such accounts payable is the 60-day London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as of the beginning of the month of the invoice date, plus 0.75%. As of May 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had no amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program. In November 2011, the Company entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings pursuant to a revolving credit facility with the option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with lender approval. The facility matures in November 2016, with a one-year extension option prior to both the second and third anniversary of the closing date, provided that extensions shall not extend beyond November 1, 2018. This facility replaces the prior $1 billion committed credit facility agreement that would have expired in December 2012. Based on the Companys current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.56%. The facility fee is 0.065% of the total commitment. Under this committed credit facility, the Company must maintain, among other things, certain minimum specified financial ratios with which the Company was in compliance at May 31, 2012. No amounts were outstanding under this facility as of May 31, 2012 or 2011. NOTE 8  Long-Term Debt Long-term debt, net of unamortized premiums and discounts and swap fair value adjustments, is comprised of the following: ##TABLE_START            Book Value Outstanding As of May 31,  Scheduled Maturity (Dollars in millions)  Original Principal   Interest Rate   Interest Payments   2012   2011  Corporate Bond Payables: (1)         July 23, 2012  $ 25    5.66 %   Semi-Annually   $ 25   $ 26  August 7, 2012  $ 15    5.40 %   Semi-Annually    15    16  October 1, 2013  $ 50    4.70 %   Semi-Annually    50    50  October 15, 2015  $ 100    5.15 %   Semi-Annually    115    114  Japanese Yen Notes:         June 26, 2011   10,500    4.30 %   Semi-Annually        130  February 14, 2012   5,000    1.52 %   Semi-Annually        62  August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020 (2)   9,000    2.60 %   Quarterly    50    54  August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020 (2)   4,000    2.00 %   Quarterly    22    24  Total               277    476  Less current maturities               49    200  TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT              $ 228   $ 276  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) For each of these notes, except the $50 million note maturing in October 1, 2013, the Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby the Company receives fixed interest payments at the same rate as the notes and pays variable interest payments based on the six-month LIBOR plus a spread. Each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding note. At May 31, 2012, the interest rates payable on these swap agreements ranged from approximately 0.6% to 1.0%. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) NIKE Logistics YK assumed a total of 13.0 billion in loans as part of its agreement to purchase a distribution center in Japan, which serves as collateral for the loans. These loans mature in equal quarterly installments during the period August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020. ##TABLE_END The scheduled maturity of long-term debt in each of the years ending May 31, 2013 through 2017 are $49 million, $59 million, $9 million, $109 million and $9 million, respectively, at face value. The fair value of the Companys long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $283 million at May 31, 2012 and $482 million at May 31, 2011. The fair value of long-term debt is estimated based upon quoted prices of similar instruments (level 2).  ##TABLE_START  52   ##TABLE_END NOTE 9  Income Taxes Income before income taxes is as follows: ##TABLE_START      Year Ended May 31,  (In millions)   2012    2011    2010  Income before income taxes:       United States  $ 792   $ 1,084   $ 699  Foreign   2,191    1,760    1,818  TOTAL INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  $ 2,983   $ 2,844   $ 2,517  ##TABLE_END The provision for income taxes is as follows: ##TABLE_START      Year Ended May 31,  (In millions)   2012    2011    2010  Current:       United States       Federal  $ 274   $ 289   $ 200  State   51    57    50  Foreign   495    441    349  Total   820    787    599  Deferred:       United States       Federal   (54 )   (61 )   18  State   4        (1 ) Foreign   (10 )   (15 )   (6 ) Total   (60 )   (76 )   11  TOTAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE  $ 760   $ 711   $ 610  ##TABLE_END A reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate follows: ##TABLE_START      Year Ended May 31,      2012    2011    2010  Federal income tax rate   35.0 %   35.0 %   35.0 % State taxes, net of federal benefit   1.3 %   1.3 %   1.3 % Foreign earnings   -11.5 %   -10.5 %   -12.7 % Other, net   0.7 %   -0.8 %   0.6 % EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE   25.5 %   25.0 %   24.2 % ##TABLE_END The effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 50 basis points higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 primarily due to changes in uncertain tax positions, partially offset by a reduction in the effective tax rate on operations outside of the United States as a result of changes in geographical mix of foreign earnings. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 80 basis points higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 primarily due to the change in geographic mix of earnings. A larger percentage of our earnings in fiscal 2011 were attributable to operations in the U.S., where the statutory tax rate is generally higher than the effective tax rate on operations outside of the U.S. This impact was partially offset by changes to uncertain tax positions.  ##TABLE_START  53 ##TABLE_END Deferred tax assets and (liabilities) are comprised of the following: ##TABLE_START   May 31,  (In millions)   2012    2011  Deferred tax assets:      Allowance for doubtful accounts  $ 18   $ 19  Inventories   40    63  Sales return reserves   85    72  Deferred compensation   177    152  Stock-based compensation   144    148  Reserves and accrued liabilities   68    66  Foreign loss carry-forwards   76    60  Foreign tax credit carry-forwards   216    236  Hedges       21  Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries   82      Other   71    86  Total deferred tax assets   977    923  Valuation allowance   (81 )   (51 ) Total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance   896    872  Deferred tax liabilities:      Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries       (40 ) Property, plant and equipment   (186 )   (151 ) Intangibles   (98 )   (97 ) Other   (21 )   (21 ) Total deferred tax liability   (305 )   (309 ) NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET  $ 591   $ 563  ##TABLE_END The following is a reconciliation of the changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties: ##TABLE_START   May 31,  (In millions)   2012    2011    2010  Unrecognized tax benefits, as of the beginning of the period  $ 212   $ 282   $ 274  Gross increases related to prior period tax positions   48    13    87  Gross decreases related to prior period tax positions   (25 )   (98 )   (122 ) Gross increases related to current period tax positions   91    59    52  Gross decreases related to current period tax positions   (1 )   (6 )     Settlements   (20 )   (43 )   (3 ) Lapse of statute of limitations   (9 )   (8 )   (9 ) Changes due to currency translation   (11 )   13    3  UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD  $ 285   $ 212   $ 282  ##TABLE_END As of May 31, 2012, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were $285 million, $165 million of which would affect the Companys effective tax rate if recognized in future periods. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The liability for payment of interest and penalties increased $17 million, $10 million, and $6 million during the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. As of May 31, 2012 and 2011, accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $108 million and $91 million, respectively (excluding federal benefit). The Company is subject to taxation primarily in the U.S., China, the Netherlands, and Brazil, as well as various state and other foreign jurisdictions. The Company has concluded substantially all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal year 2010. The Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2011 and 2012 tax years. The Companys major foreign jurisdictions, China, the Netherlands and Brazil, have concluded substantially all income tax matters through calendar 2001, fiscal 2006 and calendar 2004, respectively. The Company estimates that it is reasonably possible that the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $58 million within the next 12 months as a result of resolutions of global tax examinations and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. The Company has indefinitely reinvested approximately $5.5 billion of the cumulative undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings would be subject to U.S. taxation if repatriated to the U.S. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with the indefinitely reinvested undistributed earnings at May 31, 2012 is $1.8 billion. A portion of the Companys foreign operations are benefitting from tax holidays that will phase out in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2021. These tax holidays may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The decrease in income tax expense for the year ended May 31, 2012 as a result of these arrangements was approximately $103 million ($0.22 per diluted share) and $36 million ($0.07 per diluted share) for the year ended May 31, 2011. Deferred tax assets at May 31, 2012 and 2011 were reduced by a valuation allowance relating to tax benefits of certain subsidiaries with operating losses. The net change in the valuation allowance was an increase of $30 million and $15 million for the years ended May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  ##TABLE_START  54   ##TABLE_END The Company has recorded deferred tax assets of $216 million at May 31, 2012 for foreign tax credit carry-forwards with expiration dates between 2020 and 2022. The Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of $247 million at May 31, 2012. Such losses, if not utilized, will expire as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ending May 31,  (In millions)  2013      2014      2015      2016      2017- 2032      Indefinite      Total  Net Operating Losses  $       8      3      8      131      97     $ 247  ##TABLE_END During the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, income tax benefits attributable to employee stock-based compensation transactions of $120 million, $68 million, and $57 million, respectively, were allocated to shareholders equity. NOTE 10  Redeemable Preferred Stock Sojitz America is the sole owner of the Companys authorized Redeemable Preferred Stock, $1 par value, which is redeemable at the option of Sojitz America or the Company at par value aggregating $0.3 million. A cumulative dividend of $0.10 per share is payable annually on May 31 and no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock of the Company unless dividends on the Redeemable Preferred Stock have been declared and paid in full. There have been no changes in the Redeemable Preferred Stock in the three years ended May 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010. As the holder of the Redeemable Preferred Stock, Sojitz America does not have general voting rights but does have the right to vote as a separate class on the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, on merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company or on the sale or assignment of the NIKE trademark for athletic footwear sold in the United States. NOTE 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation The authorized number of shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value, and Class B Common Stock, no par value, are 175 million and 750 million, respectively. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors. There are no differences in the dividend and liquidation preferences or participation rights of the Class A and Class B common stockholders. In 1990, the Board of Directors adopted, and the shareholders approved, the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1990 Plan). The 1990 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 163 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with stock options and other awards granted under the plan. The 1990 Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance-based awards. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the 1990 Plan. The committee has the authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards, and the other terms and conditions of the awards. Substantially all stock option grants outstanding under the 1990 Plan were granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year, vest ratably over four years, and expire 10 years from the date of grant. The following table summarizes the Companys total stock-based compensation expense recognized in selling and administrative expense: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,  (In millions)   2012   2011       2010  Stock options (1)  $96  $ 77    $ 135  ESPPs  16   14     14  Restricted stock  18   14      10  TOTAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE  $130  $ 105     $ 159  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Expense for stock options includes the expense associated with stock appreciation rights. Accelerated stock option expense is recorded for employees eligible for accelerated stock option vesting upon retirement. In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company changed the accelerated vesting provisions of its stock option plan. Under the new provisions, accelerated stock option expense for years ended May 31, 2012 and 2011 was $17 million and $12 million, respectively. The accelerated stock option expense for the year ended May 31, 2010 was $74 million. ##TABLE_END As of May 31, 2012, the Company had $151 million of unrecognized compensation costs from stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, to be recognized as selling and administrative expense over a weighted average period of 2.2 years.  ##TABLE_START  55 ##TABLE_END The weighted average fair value per share of the options granted during the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, as computed using the Black-Scholes pricing model, was $22.15, $17.68, and $23.43, respectively. The weighted average assumptions used to estimate these fair values are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,     2012   2011   2010  Dividend yield   1.4 %   1.6 %   1.9 % Expected volatility   29.5 %   31.5 %   57.6 % Weighted average expected life (in years)   5.0    5.0    5.0  Risk-free interest rate   1.4 %   1.7 %   2.5 % ##TABLE_END The Company estimates the expected volatility based on the implied volatility in market traded options on the Companys common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. The weighted average expected life of options is based on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns. The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rate in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the options. The following summarizes the stock option transactions under the plan discussed above: ##TABLE_START   Shares (1)     Weighted Average Option Price      (In millions)      Options outstanding May 31, 2009   38.8   $ 43.69  Exercised   (8.6 )   37.64  Forfeited   (0.6 )   51.92  Granted   6.4    52.79  Options outstanding May 31, 2010   36.0   $ 46.60  Exercised   (7.0 )   42.70  Forfeited   (0.5 )   58.08  Granted   6.3    69.20  Options outstanding May 31, 2011   34.8   $ 51.29  Exercised   (9.0 )   45.62  Forfeited   (0.4 )   71.04  Granted   6.8    91.74  Options outstanding May 31, 2012   32.2   $ 61.18  Options exercisable at May 31,      2010   20.4    41.16  2011   20.1    44.05  2012   17.0   $ 48.75  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Includes stock appreciation rights transactions. ##TABLE_END The weighted average contractual life remaining for options outstanding and options exercisable at May 31, 2012 was 6.3 years and 4.6 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable at May 31, 2012 was $1,512 million and $1,008 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value was the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of the options. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 was $453 million, $267 million, and $239 million, respectively. In addition to the 1990 Plan, the Company gives employees the right to purchase shares at a discount to the market price under employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs). Employees are eligible to participate through payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation. At the end of each six-month offering period, shares are purchased by the participants at 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or the end of the offering period. Employees purchased 0.8 million shares during each of the three years ended May 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. From time to time, the Company grants restricted stock units and restricted stock to key employees under the 1990 Plan. The number of shares underlying such awards granted to employees during the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 were 0.4 million, 0.2 million, and 0.5 million with weighted average values per share of $98.99, $70.23, and $53.16, respectively. Recipients of restricted stock are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respective shares throughout the period of restriction. Recipients of restricted stock units are entitled to dividend equivalent cash payments upon vesting. The value of all grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units was established by the market price on the date of grant. During the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, the aggregate fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested was $22 million, $15 million, and $8 million, respectively, determined as of the date of vesting.  ##TABLE_START  56   ##TABLE_END NOTE 12  Earnings Per Share The following is a reconciliation from basic earnings per share to diluted earnings per share. Options to purchase an additional 0.1 million, 0.2 million, and 0.2 million shares of common stock were outstanding at May 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options were anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,  (In millions, except per share data)   2012    2011    2010  Determination of shares:       Weighted average common shares outstanding   460.0    475.5    485.5  Assumed conversion of dilutive stock options and awards   9.8    10.2    8.4  DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING   469.8    485.7    493.9  Basic earnings per common share  $ 4.83   $ 4.48   $ 3.93  Diluted earnings per common share  $ 4.73   $ 4.39   $ 3.86  ##TABLE_END NOTE 13  Benefit Plans The Company has a profit sharing plan available to most U.S.-based employees. The terms of the plan call for annual contributions by the Company as determined by the Board of Directors. A subsidiary of the Company also had a profit sharing plan available to its U.S.-based employees prior to fiscal 2012. The terms of the plan called for annual contributions as determined by the subsidiarys executive management. Contributions of $40 million, $39 million, and $35 million were made to the plans and are included in selling and administrative expense for the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The Company has various 401(k) employee savings plans available to U.S.-based employees. The Company matches a portion of employee contributions. Company contributions to the savings plans were $44 million, $39 million, and $34 million for the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, and are included in selling and administrative expense. The Company also has a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) that was adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by shareholders in September 1997 and later amended in fiscal 2007. The Company recognized $51 million, $31 million, and $24 million of selling and administrative expense related to cash awards under the LTIP during the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The Company has pension plans in various countries worldwide. The pension plans are only available to local employees and are generally government mandated. The liability related to the unfunded pension liabilities of the plans was $115 million and $93 million at May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which was primarily classified as long-term in other liabilities. NOTE 14  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income The components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, are as follows: ##TABLE_START   May 31,  (In millions)   2012    2011  Cumulative translation adjustment and other  $ (127 )  $ 168  Net deferred gain (loss) on cash flow hedge derivatives   181    (123 ) Net deferred gain on net investment hedge derivatives   95    50  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  $ 149   $ 95  ##TABLE_END Refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives. NOTE 15  Commitments and Contingencies The Company leases space for certain of its offices, warehouses and retail stores under leases expiring from 1 to 23 years after May 31, 2012. Rent expense was $494 million, $446 million, and $416 million for the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Amounts of minimum future annual rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases in each of the five years ending May 31, 2013 through 2017 are $408 million, $387 million, $271 million, $224 million, $186 million, respectively, and $662 million in later years. As of May 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling $138 million and $99 million, respectively. These letters of credit were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and guarantees of the Companys performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. In connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the Companys historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of its pending legal matters with certainty, the Company does not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  ##TABLE_START  57 ##TABLE_END NOTE 16  Risk Management and Derivatives The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2012 are designated as cash flow or fair value hedges. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date. The total notional amount of outstanding derivatives as of May 31, 2012 was approximately $7 billion, which is primarily comprised of cash flow hedges for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs.

Cash Flow Hedges The purpose of the Companys foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the Company from the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from transactions in foreign currencies will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Foreign currency exposures that the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external and intercompany revenues, selling and administrative expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions. Product cost exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below. NIKE entities primarily purchase products in two ways: 1) Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a wholly-owned centralized sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from external factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC; 2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from external factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. In January 2012, the Company implemented a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, the Companys payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order. Embedded derivatives are separated from the related purchase order and their accounting treatment is described further below. The Companys policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. Hedged transactions are denominated primarily in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. The Company may enter into hedge contracts typically starting 12 to 18 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges for up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. All changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, excluding any ineffective portion, are recorded in other comprehensive income until net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. In most cases, amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be released to net income some time after the maturity of the related derivative. Effective hedge results are classified within the consolidated statements of income in the same manner as the underlying exposure, with the results of hedges of non-functional currency denominated revenues and product cost exposures, excluding embedded derivatives as described below, recorded in revenues or cost of sales, when the underlying hedged transaction affects consolidated net income. Results of hedges of selling and administrative expense are recorded together with those costs when the related expense is recorded. Results of hedges of anticipated purchases and sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities are recorded in other expense (income), net when the securities are sold. Results of hedges of certain anticipated intercompany transactions are recorded in other expense (income), net when the transaction occurs. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from these designated cash flow hedge derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, generally within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement. Premiums paid on options are initially recorded as deferred charges. The Company assesses the effectiveness of options based on the total cash flows method and records total changes in the options fair value to other comprehensive income to the degree they are effective. The Company formally assesses, both at a hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Effectiveness for cash flow hedges is assessed based on forward rates. Ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it determines that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item (including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions); (2) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (3) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, but is expected to occur within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified to net income when the forecasted transaction affects consolidated net income. However, if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in other expense (income), net. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing future changes in the fair value in other expense (income), net. For the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the amounts recorded in other expense (income), net as a result of the  ##TABLE_START  59 ##TABLE_END discontinuance of cash flow hedging because the forecasted transaction was no longer probable of occurring were immaterial. As of May 31, 2012, $162 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives accumulated in other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in net income. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2012, the maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions is 24 months. Fair Value Hedges The Company is also exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives currently used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. As of May 31, 2012, all interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt and meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. The cash flows associated with the Companys fair value hedges are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding, which are reflected within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011, or 2010. Net Investment Hedges The Company also hedges the risk of variability in foreign-currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges, except ineffective portions, are reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its net investment hedges within the cash provided or used by investing component of the cash flow statement. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness based on changes in forward rates. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its net investment hedges for the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011, or 2010. Embedded Derivatives As described above, for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order. Embedded derivatives are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related purchase order and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the balance sheet with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in other expense (income), net from the date a purchase order is accepted by a factory through the date the purchase price is no longer subject to foreign currency fluctuations. At May 31, 2012, the notional amount of embedded derivatives was approximately $131 million. For the year ended May 31, 2012, a $1 million gain was recorded within other expense (income), net related to embedded derivatives. There were no amounts recognized in other expense (income), net for the years ended May 31, 2011 or 2010. Undesignated Derivative Instruments The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and/or the embedded derivative contracts explained above. These forwards are not designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, these undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the balance sheet with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in other expense (income), net, together with the re-measurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position or embedded derivative contract. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from undesignated instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, generally within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement. Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. However, this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored and managed according to prescribed guidelines. The Company also utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions either headquartered or operating in the same countries in which the Company conducts its business. The Companys derivative contracts contain credit risk related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Companys bilateral credit related contingent features require the owing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50 million should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than $50 million. Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also trigger collateral requirements. As of May 31, 2012, the Company was in compliance with all credit risk related contingent features and the aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features that were in a net liability position was $6 million. Accordingly, the Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features. Given the considerations described above, the Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial. NOTE 17  Operating Segments and Related Information Operating Segments. The Companys operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Companys internal organization. The major segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity excluding NIKE Golf. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of sports and fitness footwear, apparel, and equipment. The Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. The Companys NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment. The Companys Other category is broken into two components for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. The Global Brand Divisions category primarily represents NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment, demand creation and operating overhead expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand, and costs associated with product development and supply chain operations. The Other Businesses category primarily consists of the activities of Cole Haan, Converse Inc., Hurley International LLC, NIKE Golf and Umbro Ltd. Activities represented in the Other category are considered immaterial for individual disclosure.  ##TABLE_START  60   ##TABLE_END Corporate consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses, which include expenses associated with centrally managed departments, depreciation and amortization related to the Companys headquarters, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, including stock-based compensation, certain foreign currency gains and losses, including hedge gains and losses, certain corporate eliminations and other items. The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (commonly referred to as EBIT), which represents net income before interest expense, net and income taxes in the consolidated statements of income. Reconciling items for EBIT represent corporate expense items that are not allocated to the operating segments for management reporting. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses. These rates are set approximately nine months in advance of the future selling season based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and cost of sales for geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses reflect use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entitys functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses. Accounts receivable, inventories and property, plant and equipment for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below. Additions to long-lived assets as presented in the following table represent capital expenditures. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2012 presentation.  ##TABLE_START  61 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,  (In millions)   2012    2011    2010  REVENUE       North America  $ 8,839   $ 7,579   $ 6,697  Western Europe   4,144    3,868    3,839  Central  Eastern Europe   1,200    1,040    999  Greater China   2,539    2,060    1,742  Japan   829    766    882  Emerging Markets   3,410    2,736    2,198  Global Brand Divisions   111    96    86  Total NIKE Brand   21,072    18,145    16,443  Other Businesses   3,095    2,786    2,564  Corporate   (39 )   (69 )   7  TOTAL NIKE CONSOLIDATED REVENUES  $ 24,128   $ 20,862   $ 19,014  EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES       North America  $ 2,007   $ 1,736   $ 1,538  Western Europe   597    730    807  Central  Eastern Europe   234    244    249  Greater China   911    777    637  Japan   136    114    180  Emerging Markets   853    688    521  Global Brand Divisions   (1,177 )   (971 )   (866 ) Total NIKE Brand   3,561    3,318    3,066  Other Businesses   341    335    298  Corporate   (916 )   (805 )   (841 ) Total NIKE Consolidated Earnings Before Interest and Taxes   2,986    2,848    2,523  Interest expense, net   3    4    6  TOTAL NIKE CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS BEFORE TAXES  $ 2,983   $ 2,844   $ 2,517  ADDITIONS TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS       North America  $ 131   $ 79   $ 45  Western Europe   93    75    59  Central  Eastern Europe   20    5    4  Greater China   38    43    80  Japan   14    9    12  Emerging Markets   27    21    11  Global Brand Divisions   131    44    30  Total NIKE Brand   454    276    241  Other Businesses   34    38    52  Corporate   109    118    42  TOTAL ADDITIONS TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS  $ 597   $ 432   $ 335  DEPRECIATION       North America  $ 78   $ 70   $ 65  Western Europe   62    52    57  Central  Eastern Europe   6    4    4  Greater China   25    19    11  Japan   23    22    26  Emerging Markets   15    14    12  Global Brand Divisions   53    39    33  Total NIKE Brand   262    220    208  Other Businesses   45    44    46  Corporate   66    71    70  TOTAL DEPRECIATION  $ 373   $ 335   $ 324  ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  62   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   May 31,  (In millions)   2012    2011  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET      North America  $ 1,149   $ 1,069  Western Europe   420    500  Central  Eastern Europe   261    290  Greater China   221    140  Japan   152    153  Emerging Markets   476    466  Global Brand Divisions   30    23  Total NIKE Brand   2,709    2,641  Other Businesses   549    471  Corporate   22    26  TOTAL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET  $ 3,280   $ 3,138  INVENTORIES   North America  $ 1,272   $ 1,034  Western Europe   488    434  Central  Eastern Europe   180    145  Greater China   217    152  Japan   83    82  Emerging Markets   521    429  Global Brand Divisions   35    25  Total NIKE Brand   2,796    2,301  Other Businesses   511    414  Corporate   43      TOTAL INVENTORIES  $ 3,350   $ 2,715  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET   North America  $ 378   $ 330  Western Europe   314    338  Central  Eastern Europe   30    13  Greater China   191    179  Japan   359    360  Emerging Markets   59    58  Global Brand Divisions   205    116  Total NIKE Brand   1,536    1,394  Other Businesses   146    164  Corporate   597    557  TOTAL PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET  $ 2,279   $ 2,115  ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  63 ##TABLE_END Revenues by Major Product Lines.

Controls and Procedures ##TABLE_END We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We carry out a variety of on-going procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of May 31, 2012. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included in Item 8 on page 37 of this Report. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B. Other Information ##TABLE_END On July 20, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors approved the grant of restricted stock units under the Companys 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the RSUs), to Donald W.

Business ##TABLE_START General ##TABLE_END NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1968 under the laws of the state of Oregon. As used in this report, the terms we, us, NIKE and the Company refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our internet address is www.nike.com. On our NIKE Corporate website, located at www.nikeinc.com, we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission: our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All such filings on our NIKE Corporate website are available free of charge. Also available on the NIKE Corporate website are the charters of the committees of our board of directors, as well as our corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics; copies of any of these documents will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores and internet websites (which we refer to as our Direct to Consumer operations) and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees, in virtually all countries around the world. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Virtually all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment products are produced both in the United States and abroad. ##TABLE_START Products ##TABLE_END We focus our NIKE Brand and Brand Jordan product offerings in seven key categories: Running, Basketball, Football (Soccer), Mens Training, Womens Training, NIKE Sportswear (our sports-inspired lifestyle products), and Action Sports. We also market products designed for kids, as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as baseball, cricket, golf, lacrosse, outdoor activities, football, tennis, volleyball, walking, and wrestling. NIKEs athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on high quality construction and innovation in our products. NIKE Sportswear, Running, Basketball, Football (Soccer), and kids shoes are currently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in product sales in the near future. We sell sports apparel and accessories covering most of the above-mentioned categories, which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in collections of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos. We sell a line of performance equipment under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment, golf clubs, and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Converse Inc. (Converse), headquartered in North Andover, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories under the Converse  , Chuck Taylor  , All Star  , One Star  , Star Chevron  and Jack Purcell  trademarks. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hurley International LLC (Hurley), headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the Hurley  trademark. In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our Direct to Consumer operations, we have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities. As part of our long-term growth strategy, we continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses to ensure we are investing in those businesses that are accretive to the NIKE Brand with the largest growth potential and highest returns. On February 1, 2013, and November 30, 2012, we completed the divestitures of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses, respectively, allowing us to better focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands. ##TABLE_START Sales and Marketing ##TABLE_END Financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in Note 18  Operating Segments and Related Information of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel, and equipment. Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services. Our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment. ##TABLE_START United States Market ##TABLE_ENDIn fiscal 2013, sales in the United States, including U.S. sales of our Other Businesses, accounted for approximately 45% of total revenues, compared to 42% in both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011. Converse and Hurley, our affiliate brands, and NIKE Golf comprise our Other Businesses. We sell to thousands of retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops, and other retail accounts. During fiscal 2013, our three largest customers accounted for approximately 25% of sales in the United States. We make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price. In fiscal 2013, 87% of our U.S. wholesale footwear shipments (excluding our Other Businesses) were made under the futures program, compared to 86% in fiscal 2012 and 87% in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2013, 67% of our U.S. wholesale apparel shipments (excluding our Other Businesses) were made under the futures program, compared to 64% in fiscal 2012 and 60% in fiscal 2011. We utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit sales in the United States as well as independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf, skateboarding, and snowboarding. In addition, our Direct to Consumer operations sell NIKE Brand products to consumers through our internet website, www.nike.com , and through the following number of retail stores in the United States: ##TABLE_START U.S. Retail Stores Number NIKE Brand factory stores NIKE Brand in-line stores, including NIKETOWNs and employee-only stores Converse stores (including factory stores) Hurley stores (including factory and employee stores) TOTAL ##TABLE_ENDNIKE has five primary distribution centers in the United States located in Memphis, Tennessee, three of which are leased. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California distribution center. Converse and Hurley products are shipped primarily from Ontario, California. ##TABLE_START International Markets ##TABLE_ENDIn fiscal 2013, non-U.S. sales including non-U.S. sales of our Other Businesses accounted for 55% of total revenues, compared to 58% in both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011. We sell our products to retail accounts, through our own Direct to Consumer operations, and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees, and sales representatives around the world. We sell to thousands of retail accounts and operate 16 distribution centers outside of the United States. In many countries and regions, including Canada, Asia, some Latin American countries, and Europe, we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the United States futures ordering program described above. During fiscal 2013, NIKEs three largest customers outside of the U.S. accounted for approximately 6% of total non-U.S. sales. Our Direct to Consumer business operates the following number of retail stores outside the United States: ##TABLE_START Non-U.S. Retail Stores Number NIKE Brand factory stores NIKE Brand in-line stores, including NIKETOWNs and employee-only stores Converse stores (including factory stores) TOTAL ##TABLE_ENDInternational branch offices and subsidiaries of NIKE are located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and Vietnam. ##TABLE_START Significant Customer ##TABLE_ENDNo customer accounted for 10% or more of our worldwide net sales during fiscal 2013. ##TABLE_START Orders ##TABLE_ENDWorldwide futures orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from June through November 2013, were $12.1 billion compared to $11.2 billion for the same period last year. This futures orders amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders and the fulfillment of certain of these futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of discounts, order cancellations and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Other Businesses. ##TABLE_START Product Research and Development ##TABLE_ENDWe believe our research and development efforts are a key factor in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel, and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as NIKE strives to produce products that help to reduce injury, enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort. In addition to NIKEs own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability, and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, and other experts who consult with us and review designs, materials, concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process. ##TABLE_START Manufacturing ##TABLE_ENDVirtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers. In fiscal 2013, contract factories in Vietnam, China and Indonesia manufactured approximately 42%, 30%, and 26% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. We also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in Argentina, Brazil, India, and Mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. The largest single footwear factory with which we have contracted accounted for approximately 6% of total fiscal 2013 NIKE Brand footwear production. Almost all of NIKE Brand apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers located in 28 countries. Most of this apparel production occurred in China, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Malaysia, Turkey, Mexico, and Cambodia. The largest single apparel factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 6% of total fiscal 2013 apparel production. The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, nylon, leather, canvas, and polyurethane films used to make Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2013, NIKE IHM, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NIKE, Inc., with facilities in Beaverton, Oregon and St. Louis, Missouri, as well as independent contractors in China and Vietnam, were our largest suppliers of the Air-Sole cushioning components used in footwear. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, plastic and metal hardware, and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain and snow, retain heat, or efficiently wick moisture away from the body. NIKEs independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. We have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements. Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed significant import-export financing services for us. During fiscal 2013, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Brazil, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, South Africa, Korea, and Thailand, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 13% of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates. Our current agreements with Sojitz America expire on May 31, 2014. ##TABLE_START International Operations and Trade ##TABLE_ENDOur international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as possible revaluation of currencies, export and import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future. In recent years, uncertain global and regional economic conditions have affected international trade and caused a rise in protectionist actions around the world.  These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, such protectionist measures, if implemented, could result in increases in the cost of our products, which may in turn adversely affect our sales or profitability as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole. We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions. In Brazil, we are actively monitoring for dumping investigations against products from China and other countries that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may increase customs clearance times for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. Moreover, with respect to trade restrictions targeting China, which represents an important sourcing and consumer marketing country for us, we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i)  addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii)  is consistent with international trade rules, and (iii)  reflects and considers China's domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community. Where trade protection measures are implemented, we believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability. ##TABLE_START Competition ##TABLE_ENDThe athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry is highly competitive in the United States and on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel, and equipment, including adidas, V.F. Corp., Puma, Li Ning and Under Armour, among others. We also compete with a number of vertical retailers such as Lululemon and Uniqlo. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment in the world. Important aspects of competition in this industry are: ##TABLE_START  Product quality; performance and reliability; new product innovation and development; and consumer price/value; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consumer connection and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing and promotion; customer support and service; identification with prominent and influential athletes, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products; and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Effective distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, in store and online. ##TABLE_END We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas. ##TABLE_START Trademarks and Patents ##TABLE_ENDWe utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh Design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement. NIKE has an exclusive, worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented Air technology. The process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane. Some of the early NIKE AIR patents have expired, which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology. Subsequent NIKE AIR patents will not expire for several years. We also file and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility patents, as well as many U.S. and foreign design patents covering components, manufacturing techniques and features used in various athletic and leisure footwear, apparel, athletic equipment, digital devices and golf products. These patents expire at various times, and patents issued for applications filed this year in the U.S. will last until 2027 for design patents and until 2033 for utility patents. We believe our success depends primarily upon our capabilities in design, research and development, production, and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patent position. However, we have followed a policy of filing patent applications for the United States and foreign patents on inventions, designs, and improvements that we deem valuable. ##TABLE_START Employees ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2013, we had approximately 48,000 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. Management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent. None of our employees are represented by a union, except for certain employees in the Emerging Markets geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into and/or comply with industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements. ##TABLE_START Executive Officers of the Registrant ##TABLE_ENDThe executive officers of NIKE, Inc. as of July 19, 2013 are as follows: Philip H.

Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKEs business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKEs policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE. Our products face intense competition. NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. The athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry is highly competitive in the United States and on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel, and equipment. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products and for import quota capacity. Our competitors product offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, and customer service are areas of intense competition. This, in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly. Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business. Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, product innovation and product quality. Our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design (including materials) and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity. In addition, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. Negative posts or comments about us on social networking websites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image. If we do not maintain, extend and expand our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profits. Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. However, long lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories and lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media and online advertising. If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. We rely on technical innovation and high quality products to compete in the market for our products. Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel, and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products. Research and development plays a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to reduce injury, enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. Failure to continue to obtain high quality endorsers of our products could harm our business. We establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues to evaluate, promote, and establish product authenticity with consumers. If certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues, or negative posts or comments about our sports marketing endorsements on social networking websites, could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products, or a failure to enter into cost effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sales of our products. Global capital and credit market conditions, and resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world. Continuing volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets have led to fluctuations in the availability of business credit and capital liquidity, a contraction of consumer credit, business failures, higher unemployment, and declines in consumer confidence and spending in many parts of the world. If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate or remain weak for an extended period of time, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition: ##TABLE_START  Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts, increased inventories, and lower gross margins. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We may be unable to find suitable investments that are safe, liquid, and provide a reasonable return. This could result in lower interest income or longer investment horizons. Disruptions to capital markets or the banking system may also impair the value of investments or bank deposits we currently consider safe or liquid. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The failure of financial institution counterparties to honor their obligations to us under credit and derivative instruments could jeopardize our ability to rely on and benefit from those instruments. Our ability to replace those instruments on the same or similar terms may be limited under poor market conditions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We conduct transactions in various currencies, which increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported financial results and condition. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Continued volatility and availability in the markets and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum derivatives) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins, and profitability. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If retailers of our products experience declining revenues, or retailers experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, inability of retailers to timely meet their payment obligations to us, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts, and increased bad debt expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could reduce the availability of our products to consumers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products. ##TABLE_END Our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results and stock price. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, availability of import quotas and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix, geographic sales trends, and currency exchange rate fluctuations, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues. We make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price. Our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory, purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders, and the risk of non-delivery. We report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports. Although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues, reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of changes in revenues for any future period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, shipping timing, returns, and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Other Businesses. Our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins and harm to our business. We purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, and diminish brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance. We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers. We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products, we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be canceled, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties, which have had an adverse effect on our business. When the retail economy weakens, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A slowing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers who experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products. Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk, and impair our ability to sell our products. The athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment retailers with many stores. These retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. These situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity, it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. In addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues. Our Direct to Consumer operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Our Direct to Consumer locations have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than certain of our other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our Direct to Consumer operations, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and employee-related costs. Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Companys control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud; mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation. Risks specific to our e-commerce business also include diversion of sales from our brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands. Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business. We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying us, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh Design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize on or in the marketing of our products. We believe that our trademarks, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success, and our competitive position. We periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in challenging a partys products on the basis of trade secret misappropriation or trademark, copyright, design patent, utility patent, or other intellectual property infringement, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products. The actions we take to establish and protect trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patents, and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights. We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their trademarks, copyrights, patents, or other intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, use, importation and/or sale of certain products. We take various actions to prevent confidential information from unauthorized use and/or disclosure. Such actions include contractual measures such as entering into non-disclosure agreements and providing confidential information awareness training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information might not always be effective. Confidential information that is related to business strategy, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used and/or disclosed resulting in a loss of reputation, a decline in our stock price, a negative impact on our market position, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties, or injunctions. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources. From time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. Failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct, local laws, and other standards could harm our business. We work with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to manufacture our products, and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our trademarks. We impose, and require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees the contract with manufacturers to make products bearing our trademarks, a code of conduct and other environmental, health, and safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety. Notwithstanding their contractual obligations, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business. Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments, and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products. In addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets, and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs, or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Increases in income tax rates could reduce our after-tax income from affected jurisdictions. We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries. If our capital or financing needs in the United States require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels, our effective income tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted. Current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction, including the United States, subject to significant change. There have been proposals to reform U.S. tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals being considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows. Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings. A majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. As a result, we conduct transactions in various currencies, which increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities. If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. As part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps, with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterpartys liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing, and financing. The principal materials used in our apparel products  natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, plastic and metal hardware, and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain or snow, retain heat, or efficiently wick moisture away from the body  are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. The principal materials used in our footwear products  natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, nylon, leather, canvas and polyurethane films  are also locally available to manufacturers. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers' to locate, train and employ adequate personnel. NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured. There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. Further, there may be wage increases, whether government mandated or otherwise, that affect our unaffiliated contract manufacturers. In addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, quality control standards, and labor, health and safety standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long-term. Because independent manufacturers manufacture a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers, could adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air freight, which could adversely affect our profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins. In addition, Sojitz America performs significant import-export financing services for most of the NIKE Brand products sold outside of the United States, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Japan, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the United States, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Japan. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. Our success depends on our global distribution facilities. We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, particularly in emerging markets, depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities, and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities. We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy, breach, interruption or security failure of that technology or any misappropriation of any data could harm our reputation or our ability to effectively operate our business. We are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party hosted services (information technology systems), across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities. Our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems. Over a number of years, we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Our work to integrate and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. In addition, hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. Any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data, our customers or employees personal information or a disruption of our business, which could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards enacted to protect this business and personal data. An inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal risks. Furthermore, we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection and use for digital marketing, digital commerce and the marketing and use of our Digital Sport products. We also engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Our information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. Misuse or leakage of personal information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and damage our reputation and credibility and have a negative impact on revenues and profits. The market for prime real estate is competitive. Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, both domestically and internationally, depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases. In addition, from time to time, we seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, or close some of our real estate locations, which may require modification of an existing lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores and could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, and the consequences and effects thereof, including energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our vendors and other suppliers, or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. From time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, acquisitions of new businesses, product offering and manufacturing innovation, and expansion of existing businesses, such as our retail operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. However, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in acquiring or expanding a business. The failure of any significant investment to provide their expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business. Our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business. Our future success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. The sale of a large number of shares held by our Chairman could depress the market price of our common stock. Philip H. Knight, Co-founder and Chairman of our Board of Directors, beneficially owns over 75.6% of our Class A Common Stock. If all of his Class A Common Stock were converted into Class B Common Stock, Mr. Knight would own over 15.8% of our Class B Common Stock. These shares are available for resale, subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws. The sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options. Our long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by Standard  Poors and Moodys Investors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new initiatives. Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock. There are provisions of our articles of incorporation and Oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, a freeze-out statute, two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company. We may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline. Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts estimates of our future performance. Analysts estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores and internet websites, which we refer to as our Direct to Consumer operations, and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and service businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, must have products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands, and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online. In addition to achieving long-term, sustainable revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas: ##TABLE_START  Expanding gross margin by: ##TABLE_END - Making our supply chain a competitive advantage; - Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation; and - Delivering innovative, premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a strong consumer price-to-value proposition. ##TABLE_START  Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of businesses to eliminate duplicative costs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Improving working capital efficiency; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Deploying capital effectively. ##TABLE_END Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals continue to be: ##TABLE_START  High single-digit revenue growth, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Mid-teens earnings per share growth, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. ##TABLE_END Over the past ten years, we have achieved or exceeded all of these financial goals. During this time, revenues and earnings per share for NIKE, Inc., inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, have grown 9% and 15%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. Our return on invested capital has increased from 18% to 24% and we expanded gross margins by approximately 260 basis points. On November 15, 2012, we announced a two-for-one stock split of both Class A and Class B Common shares. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 24, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business December 10, 2012. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 26, 2012. All share numbers and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. Our fiscal 2013 results from continuing operations demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to deliver consistent growth in revenues, earnings, and cash returns to shareholders, while investing for long-term growth. Despite the ongoing challenges in the global economy, we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2013. Our revenues grew 8% to $25.3 billion, net income from continuing operations increased 9% to $2.5 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $2.69, an 11% increase from fiscal 2012. Earnings before interest and income taxes for continuing operations increased 8% for fiscal 2013, driven by revenue growth and improved gross margin, which more than offset higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue. The increase in revenues was driven by growth across most NIKE  Brand geographies, key categories and product types. This growth was primarily fueled by: ##TABLE_START  Innovative performance and sportswear products, incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE Air, Lunar, Shox, FREE, Flywire, Dri-F.I.T, FlyKnit, NIKE +, and NIKE Fuel; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Deep brand connections to consumers through a category lens, reinforced by investments in endorsements by high profile athletes and teams (such as the NFL, FC Barcelona, Michael Jordan), high impact marketing around global sporting events (such as the Olympics, European Football Championships and NBA Finals) and digital marketing; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Strong category retail presentation online and at NIKE owned and retail partner stores. ##TABLE_END Revenues also improved for each of our Other Businesses (Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley). Our gross margins improved largely due to the positive impact of higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher product input costs, primarily labor cost inflation, and foreign currency headwinds. For fiscal 2013, the growth of our net income from continuing operations was positively affected by a year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate. In addition, diluted earnings per share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 2% decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding, as a result of share repurchases during fiscal 2013. On May 31, 2012, we announced our intention to divest of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses, which would allow us to better focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands. During the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we completed the sale of certain assets of the Umbro brand and recorded a loss on the sale of these assets of $107 million, net of tax. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we completed the sale of Cole Haan and recorded a gain on sale of $231 million, net of tax. As of May 31, 2013 the Company had substantially completed all transition services related to the sale of both businesses. Unless otherwise indicated, the following disclosures reflect the Company's continuing operations; refer to our Discontinued Operations\" section for additional information regarding our discontinued operations. While we expect to face continued macroeconomic uncertainties in the global economy, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term, by executing against the operational strategies outlined above. ##TABLE_START Results of Operations ##TABLE_END Unless otherwise indicated, the following disclosures reflect the Companys continuing operations. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data)  Fiscal 2013  Fiscal 2012  FY13 vs. FY12 % Change  Fiscal 2011  FY12 vs. FY11 % Change Revenues  $ 25,313  $ 23,331  %  $ 20,117  % Cost of sales  14,279  13,183  %  10,915  % Gross profit  11,034  10,148  %  9,202  % Gross margin %  43.6 %  43.5 %   45.7 %  Demand creation expense  2,745  2,607  %  2,344  % Operating overhead expense  5,035  4,458  %  4,017  % Total selling and administrative expense  7,780  7,065  %  6,361  % % of Revenues  30.7 %  30.3 %    31.6 %  Interest (income) expense, net  (3 )       Other (income) expense, net  (15 )     (25 )   Income before income taxes  3,272  3,025  %  2,862  % Income tax expense    %   % Effective tax rate  24.7 %  25.0 %   24.1 %  Net income from continuing operations  2,464  2,269  %  2,172  % Net income (loss) from discontinued operations   (46 )    (39 )   Net income  $ 2,485  $ 2,223  %  $ 2,133  % Diluted earnings per share - Continuing Operations  $ 2.69  $ 2.42  %  $ 2.24  % Diluted earnings per share - Discontinued Operations  $ 0.02  $ (0.05 )    $ (0.04 )   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Consolidated Operating Results ##TABLE_ENDRevenues ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 FY13 vs. FY12 % Change FY13 vs. FY12 % Change Excluding Currency Changes (2) Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs. FY11 % Change FY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency Changes (2) NIKE, Inc.

Greater China ' s results reduced NIKE, Inc. revenue growth by 1 percentage point. Revenues for our Other Businesses contributed 1 percentage point to our consolidated revenue growth. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 11% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 20% during fiscal 2013. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2013 was attributable to growth across our Running, Basketball, Football (Soccer), and Sportswear categories. The growth of NIKE footwear revenues continued to be fueled by increased demand for performance products, including Running models with NIKE FREE and Lunar technologies, NIKE and Brand Jordan Basketball styles, and performance Football (soccer) products. In fiscal 2013, unit sales of footwear increased approximately 7% and the average selling price per pair increased approximately 4%, driven equally by price increases and a shift in mix to higher priced products. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenue for fiscal 2013 was driven by our Men ' s Training category (which includes the NFL licensed business), in addition to strong demand for Running and Basketball products. Apparel unit sales in fiscal 2013 increased approximately 7% and the average selling price per unit increased approximately 3%, reflecting a favorable mix of higher priced products, such as performance Running, Basketball, and NFL licensed apparel, and to a lesser extent, higher selling prices . While wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to expand Direct to Consumer revenues. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations include NIKE owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through NIKE owned websites. For fiscal 2013, Direct to Consumer revenues represented approximately 19% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 17% in fiscal 2012. On a currency neutral basis, Direct to Consumer revenues grew 24% for fiscal 2013, as comparable store sales grew 14% and we continue to expand our store network and e-commerce business. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year, and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Revenues for our Other Businesses are comprised of results from Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for these businesses increased 9% in fiscal 2013, reflecting growth across all businesses. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011  On a currency neutral basis, revenues for NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations grew 15% for fiscal 2012, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and our Other Businesses. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for the NIKE Brand increased 15%, as every NIKE Brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2012. North America contributed approximately 7 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue increase, while the Emerging Markets and Greater China geographies contributed approximately 4 and 2 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue growth, respectively. Revenues for our Other Businesses grew 12% during fiscal 2012, contributing 1 percentage point of our consolidated revenue growth. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 15% and 13%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 16% during fiscal 2012. Continuing to fuel the growth of our NIKE Brand footwear business was the increased demand for performance products, including the NIKE Lunar and FREE technologies. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2012 was attributable to double-digit percentage growth in unit sales along with a low-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per pair, primarily reflecting the favorable impact from product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth across all key categories, notably Running, Sportswear and Basketball. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenue for fiscal 2012 was driven by mid-single-digit percentage increases in both unit sales and average selling prices. The increase in average selling prices was primarily driven by product price increases, partially offset by a higher mix of close-out sales. The overall increase in apparel sales was reflective of increased demand across most key categories. For fiscal 2012, Direct to Consumer channels represented approximately 17% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 16% in fiscal 2011. On a currency neutral basis, Direct to Consumer revenues grew 21% for fiscal 2012, as comparable store sales grew 13% and we continue to expand our store network and e-commerce business. Revenues for our Other Businesses consisted of results from our affiliate brands; Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for these businesses increased by 12% in fiscal 2012, reflecting growth across all businesses except Hurley, which was down slightly for the fiscal year. Futures Orders Futures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2013 were 8% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. The U.S.  Dollar futures order amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period.  Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders also increased 8%, as unit orders contributed approximately 5 percentage points of growth and average selling price per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of growth. By geography, futures orders growth was as follows:  ##TABLE_START   Reported Futures Orders Growth  Futures Orders Excluding Currency Changes (1) North America  %  % Western Europe  %  % Central  Eastern Europe  %  % Greater China  %  % Japan  %  % Emerging Markets  %  % Total NIKE Brand Futures Orders  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Growth rates have been restated using constant exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. ##TABLE_END The reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders, and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Other Businesses.  Gross Margin ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Fiscal 2013  Fiscal 2012  FY13 vs. FY12 % Change  Fiscal 2011  FY12 vs. FY11 % Change  Gross Profit  $ 11,034  $ 10,148  %  $ 9,202  %  Gross Margin %  43.6 %  43.5 %  bps  45.7 %  (220) bps  ##TABLE_ENDFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  For fiscal 2013, our consolidated gross margin was 10 basis points higher than fiscal 2012, primarily driven by higher net average selling prices (approximately 160 basis points) that were attributable to higher prices and a favorable sales mix. The positive benefit of higher net average selling prices was largely offset by higher product costs (approximately 110 basis points), primarily due to higher factory labor costs, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements (approximately 40 basis points). In addition, we have seen significant shifts in the mix of revenues from higher to lower margin segments of our business. While growth in these lower gross margin segments delivers incremental revenue and profits, it has a negative effect on our consolidated gross margin. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011  For fiscal 2012, our consolidated gross margin was 220 basis points lower than the prior year period, primarily driven by higher product input costs, including materials and labor, across most businesses. Also contributing to the decrease in gross margin were higher customs duty charges, discounts on close-out sales and an increase in investments in our digital business and infrastructure. Together, these factors decreased consolidated gross margin by approximately 390 basis points. Partially offsetting this decrease were positive impacts from product price increases, lower air freight costs, the growth of our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer business, and benefits from our ongoing product cost reduction initiatives.  Selling and Administrative Expense ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Fiscal 2013  Fiscal 2012  FY13 vs. FY12 % Change  Fiscal 2011  FY12 vs. FY11 % Change  Demand creation expense (1)  $ 2,745  $ 2,607  %  $ 2,344  %  Operating overhead expense  5,035  4,458  %  4,017  %  Selling and administrative expense  $ 7,780  $ 7,065  %  $ 6,361  %  % of Revenues  30.7 %  30.3 %  bps  31.6 %  (130) bps  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  Demand creation expense increased 5% compared to the prior year, mainly driven by an increase in sports marketing expense, marketing support for key product initiatives, including the NIKE Fuelband and NFL launch, as well as an increased level of marketing spending around global sporting events such as the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, demand creation expense increased 8%. Compared to the prior year, operating overhead expense increased 13%, primarily attributable to increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations, higher personnel costs, and corporate initiatives to support the growth of our overall business. Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the growth in operating overhead expense was 15%. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011  Overall, selling and administrative expense grew at a slower rate than revenues for fiscal 2012. Demand creation expense increased 11% compared to the prior year, mainly driven by an increase in sports marketing expense, marketing support for key product initiatives, including the NIKE Fuelband and NFL launch, as well as an increased level of brand event spending in advance of the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. For fiscal 2012, changes in currency exchange rates increased the growth of demand creation expense by 1 percentage point. Compared to the prior year, operating overhead expense increased 11%, primarily attributable to increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations, higher personnel costs as well as travel expenses to support the growth of our overall business. For fiscal 2012, changes in currency exchange rates increased the growth of operating overhead expense by 1 percentage point.  Other (Income) Expense, net ##TABLE_START (In millions)  Fiscal 2013  Fiscal 2012  Fiscal 2011 Other (income) expense, net  $ (15 )  $  $ (25 ) ##TABLE_ENDOther (income) expense, net is comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies, the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  For fiscal 2013, other (income), net increased $69 million compared to the prior year. This change was primarily driven by a $48 million decrease in foreign currency net losses in the current year as well as the recognition of a $24 million restructuring charge for NIKE Brand ' s Western Europe operations in the prior year. These positive impacts were partially offset by smaller net gains from non-operating items. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our income before income taxes of $56 million for fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011  For fiscal 2012, other expense, net increased $79 million compared to the prior year. This change was primarily driven by a $77 million change in foreign currency net gains in the prior year to net losses in the current year. These impacts, together with a $24 million charge recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 for the restructuring of NIKE Brand ' s Western Europe operations, were partially offset by certain net gains related to non-operating items. We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense, net did not have a significant impact on our income before income taxes for fiscal 2012.  Income Taxes ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2013  Fiscal 2012  FY13 vs. FY12 % Change  Fiscal 2011  FY12 vs. FY11 % Change Effective tax rate  24.7 %  25.0 %  (30) bps  24.1 %  bps ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  The 30 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily driven by the U.S. legislative retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit and a reduction of tax reserves on foreign operations, partially offset by an increase in the percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011  Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 90 basis points higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 primarily due to changes in estimates of uncertain tax positions. This impact was partially offset by a reduction in the effective tax rate on operations outside of the United States as a result of changes in geographical mix of foreign earnings. Discontinued Operations The Company continually evaluates its existing portfolio of businesses to ensure resources are invested in those businesses that are accretive to the NIKE Brand and represent the largest growth potential and highest returns. On May 31, 2012, the Company announced its intention to divest of Umbro and Cole Haan, allowing it to focus its resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands. On February 1, 2013, the Company completed the sale of Cole Haan to Apax Partners for an agreed upon purchase price of $570 million and received at closing $561 million, net of $9 million of purchase price adjustments. The transaction resulted in a gain on sale of $231 million, net of $137 million in tax expense; this gain is included in the net income (loss) from discontinued operations line item on the consolidated statements of income. Beginning November 30, 2012, we classified the Cole Haan disposal group as held-for-sale and presented the results of Cole Haans operations in the net income (loss) from discontinued operations line item on the consolidated statements of income. From this date until the sale, the assets and liabilities of Cole Haan were recorded as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets of NIKE, Inc. Previously, these amounts were reported in our segment presentation as Other Businesses. Under the sale agreement, we agreed to provide certain transition services to Cole Haan for an expected period of 3 to 9 months from the date of sale. We will also license NIKE proprietary Air and Lunar technologies to Cole Haan for a transition period. The continuing cash flows related to these items are not expected to be significant to Cole Haan and we will have no significant continuing involvement with Cole Haan beyond the transition services. Additionally, preexisting guarantees of certain Cole Haan lease payments remain in place after the sale; the maximum exposure under the guarantees is $44 million at May 31, 2013. The fair value of these guarantees is not material. On November 30, 2012, we completed the sale of certain assets of Umbro to Iconix Brand Group (Iconix) for $225 million. The results of Umbros operations and Umbros financial position are presented as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income and balance sheets, respectively. Previously, these amounts were reported in our segment presentation as Other Businesses. Upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria, we recorded a loss of $107 million, net of tax, on the sale of Umbro. The loss on sale was calculated as the net sales price less the Umbro assets of $248 million, including intangibles, goodwill, and fixed assets, other miscellaneous charges of $22 million, and the release of the associated cumulative translation adjustment of $129 million, offset by a $67 million tax benefit on the loss. Under the sale agreement, we provided transition services to Iconix while certain markets were transitioned to Iconix-designated licensees. These transition services are substantially complete and we have wound down the remaining operations of Umbro. For the year ended May 31, 2013 , net income (loss) from discontinued operations included, for both businesses, the net gain or loss on sale, net operating losses, tax expenses, and approximately $ 20 million in wind down costs. ##TABLE_START Operating Segments ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys reportable operating segments are based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. Our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses. These rates are set approximately nine months in advance of the future selling season based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and cost of sales for geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses reflect use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program.

Our Basketball, Men's Training, Running, and Sportswear categories drove the revenue growth in fiscal 2013. North America ' s Direct to Consumer revenue growth for fiscal 2013 was fueled by 15% growth in comparable store sales as well as the addition of new stores and rapid growth in online sales. North America footwear revenue growth was driven by higher demand in all seven key categories, most notably Basketball, Running, and Sportswear. Both unit sales and average selling price per pair increased 7% in fiscal 2013. The increase in average selling price per pair was driven approximately equally by price increases and a favorable mix of higher priced products. Apparel revenue growth in North America was driven by higher demand in our Men ' s Training category, reflecting the addition of the NFL licensed business, as well as Basketball, Women ' s Training, and Running. Unit sales increased 10% while average selling price per unit increased 12%, largely driven by a favorable mix of higher priced products. North America EBIT increased faster than revenue due to gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 50 basis points for fiscal 2013, reflecting the favorable impact of selling price increases, partially offset by higher product costs, an unfavorable mix of lower margin products and royalties for the NFL business. Selling and administrative expenses increased versus fiscal 2012, though at a rate slower than revenue; the growth was largely driven by higher demand creation expense for the Olympics in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 as well as key product initiatives, including the NFL launch, and higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion of our Direct to Consumer business and overall growth of the business. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011  Revenues for North America increased 17% for fiscal 2012, driven by growth in both wholesale and Direct to Consumer revenues. Our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers, driving demand for NIKE Brand products across all seven key categories. North Americas Direct to Consumer revenues grew 19% for fiscal 2012, driven by 15% growth in comparable store sales. For fiscal 2012, footwear revenue in North America increased 15%, driven by an increase in both unit sales and average selling prices. Unit sales rose at a double-digit rate while average selling price per pair grew at a mid-single-digit rate, reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth in all key categories, most notably Running, Basketball, Womens Training and Sportswear. Compared to the prior year, apparel revenue for North America increased 18%, primarily driven by a low-double-digit percentage growth in average selling price per unit and a mid-single-digit percentage growth in unit sales. The increase in average selling price per unit was reflective of product price increases and a greater mix of higher price point products. The overall increase in apparel sales was driven by double-digit percentage growth across most key categories, including Mens Training, Running and Basketball. For fiscal 2012, EBIT for North America increased 17% as revenue growth and improved selling and administrative expense leverage more than offset a decline in gross margin. Gross margin decreased 90 basis points during fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher product input costs and lower gross margins on close-out sales, which more than offset the favorable impact of selling price increases, lower air freight costs and the growth of our Direct to Consumer business. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by 70 basis points for fiscal 2012, as both demand creation and operating overhead expense grew at a slower rate than revenues.

Revenues for the U.K.   Ireland and AGS (Austria, Germany, and Switzerland) territories, the largest markets in Western Europe, increased 8% and 12%, respectively. The growth in Direct to Consumer revenues reflected 17% growth in comparable store sales, the addition of 19 net new factory stores and strong growth in online sales. On a category basis, Western Europe ' s revenue growth was largely driven by growth in our Running and Basketball categories. Constant currency footwear revenue growth in Western Europe was primarily driven by growth in Running, Sportswear, and Basketball. Unit sales increased 7% and average selling price per pair increased 3%, the latter primarily the result of price increases. The constant currency decrease in Western Europe apparel revenues was due to a decline in Sportswear, partially offset by growth in Running, Men ' s Training, and Basketball. Unit sales in fiscal 2013 decreased 1% while average selling price per unit decreased 3%, as higher discounts on close-out sales more than offset selling price increases. The EBIT growth in fiscal 2013 was driven by a 200 basis point increase in gross margin, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. The gross margin increase was primarily driven by favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates; higher net average selling prices were mostly offset by higher product costs. The increase in selling and administrative expense was mainly driven by an increased level of demand creation spending around the European Football Championships and Olympics in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, as well as higher sports marketing expense. Additionally, operating overhead costs increased to support the expansion of our Direct to Consumer business and overall growth of the business. Fiscal 2013 EBIT growth for Western Europe was also increased by a $24 million, one-time restructuring charge that was recorded in other (income) expense, net, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011  On a currency neutral basis, revenues for Western Europe increased 4% for fiscal 2012, as most territories reported revenue growth, which more than offset revenue declines in the U.K.  Ireland and Italy. Revenues for the U.K.  Ireland, the largest market in Western Europe, declined 3% for the fiscal 2012 period. Western Europes Direct to Consumer revenues grew 18% for fiscal 2012, including 8% growth in comparable store sales. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, footwear revenue in Western Europe increased 5% for fiscal 2012, primarily driven by a low-single-digit percentage growth in both unit sales and average selling price per pair, primarily reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on in-line and close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth in Running, Basketball and Football (Soccer), which more than offset a decline in Action Sports. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, apparel revenue in Western Europe increased 2% for fiscal 2012. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by a mid-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per unit, reflective of higher product prices. Partially offsetting the increase in average selling price per unit was a mid-single-digit percentage decline in unit sales. The overall increase in apparel sales was driven by growth in Football (Soccer) and Running, which more than offset a decline in Sportswear. On a reported basis, revenues for Western Europe increased 7% for fiscal 2012. However, EBIT fell 18%, primarily driven by a 350 basis point decline in gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues. The decline in gross margin was driven by higher product input costs and the negative impact from changes in standard currency rates, which more than offset the favorable impact of product price increases and the growth of our Direct to Consumer business. The increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was mainly driven by an increased level of demand creation spending around the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. Also reflected in Western Europes fiscal 2012 results was a $24 million charge relating to the restructuring of its operations.

Revenue growth in Central  Eastern Europe was driven by growth in all key categories, most notably Running, Football (Soccer), and Sportswear. Constant currency footwear revenue growth in fiscal 2013 was primarily driven by growth in Running, Football (Soccer), and Basketball, partially offset by lower revenues in Sportswear. Unit sales increased 6% while average selling price per pair increased 5%, primarily driven by price increases. Constant currency apparel revenue growth in fiscal 2013 was driven by growth in nearly all categories, most notably Sportswear, Football (Soccer), and Running. Unit sales increased 16%, while average selling price per unit decreased 2%, as an unfavorable mix of lower priced products more than off-set higher selling prices. EBIT for Central   Eastern Europe grew faster than revenue primarily due to gross margin improvement and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 30 basis points, largely driven by price increases and the favorable impact of our higher margin Direct to Consumer business, more than offsetting higher product costs and unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011  Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Central  Eastern Europe increased 17% for fiscal 2012, driven by growth across most territories, including double-digit growth in Russia and Turkey, which more than offset lower revenues in Greece. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Central  Eastern Europes footwear revenue grew 13%, primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales and a low-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per pair. The increase in average selling price per pair was reflective of product price increases which more than offset the negative impact of higher discounts on in-line and close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth across all key categories, most notably Running, Sportswear and Football (Soccer). Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Central  Eastern Europes apparel revenues grew 24%, mainly driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales, offset by a slight decrease in average price per unit, mainly due to less favorable product mix and higher discounts on in-line sales, which more than offset the impact from product price increases. The overall increase in apparel sales was primarily driven by growth in Football (Soccer), Sportswear and Running. On a reported basis, revenues for Central  Eastern Europe increased 15% for fiscal 2012. However, EBIT fell 4%, primarily driven by a 420 basis point decline in gross margin. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to higher product input costs as well as higher discounts on in-line and close-out products, which more than offset the favorable impact from product price increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat compared to the prior period.

These downsides were partially offset by 33% growth in our Direct to Consumer business driven by comparable store sales growth of 13% and the addition of 29 net new factory stores. Fiscal 2013 revenues for most key categories were lower than in fiscal 2012. For fiscal 2013, constant currency footwear revenue growth for Greater China declined, driven by lower sales across most key categories, most notably Sportswear and Men ' s and Women ' s Training, and increased reserves for product discounts and returns. Unit sales decreased 1%, while average selling price per pair decreased 2%, reflecting a higher mix of close-out sales and higher discounts. The decrease in constant currency apparel revenue for fiscal 2013 was driven by lower revenues in Sportswear and Men ' s and Women ' s Training, partially offset by higher revenues in Basketball. Apparel unit sales in fiscal 2013 were 3% lower than the prior year while average selling price per unit was down 6%, reflecting a higher mix of close-out sales and higher discounts. Fiscal 2013 EBIT for Greater China decreased at a faster rate than revenue, driven by lower gross margin and selling and administrative expense deleverage. Fiscal 2013 gross margin decreased 50 basis points due to a lower average selling price per unit driven by higher discounts and close-out mix partially offset by favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased as a percent of revenues, driven primarily by the increased investment in our Direct to Consumer business and the decrease in revenues. Our results in Greater China have been adversely impacted by sluggish macroeconomic growth and slow product sell-through at retail, leading to high levels of inventory in the marketplace. Our strategy to return to sustained, profitable growth in Greater China focuses on extending our brand leadership position with consumers; expanding the offering of product styles and fits designed for the Chinese consumer; and working with our retail partners to create more differentiated, productive, and profitable retail stores. Despite the challenges we have seen in China, there are indications that our strategies are taking hold in the marketplace. Comparable store sales are growing in our NIKE-owned Direct to Consumer doors and our wholesale customers are reporting comparable store growth and declining inventory levels. While we are making progress, we will continue to work with our retailers to optimize inventory, accelerate sell-through, and improve retail productivity. While China futures orders for the next six months are in line with last year, we expect revenues for the first half of the fiscal year will be below last year as we continue to manage the amount of product we ship into the market. We believe our revenue in China will stabilize around prior year levels in the second half of this fiscal year. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011  Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Greater China revenues increased 18% for fiscal 2012, driven by continued expansion in the number of both NIKE mono-branded stores owned by our wholesale customers and NIKE owned stores, as well as higher comparable store sales. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, the growth in Greater Chinas footwear revenue for fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales and a mid-single-digit growth in average unit price per pair, reflective of product price increases. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by double-digit percentage growth across most key categories, led by Running and Sportswear. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, the growth in Greater Chinas apparel revenues for fiscal 2012 was mainly driven by a high-single-digit growth in the average selling price per unit and a low-single-digit percentage increase in unit sales. The increase in average selling price was reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on in-line and close-out products to accelerate the sales of slower moving apparel inventories. On a reported basis, revenues for Greater China increased 23% for fiscal 2012, while EBIT grew 17%, as revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in gross margin and an increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues. Gross margin decreased 150 basis points for fiscal 2012, primarily attributable to higher product input costs and discounts on close-out products, which more than offset the favorable impact of product price increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points, driven by an increase in operating overhead expense.

Fiscal 2013 EBIT for Japan decreased as a result of lower revenues, partially offset by gross margin improvement and lower selling and administrative expense. The decrease in selling and administrative expense in fiscal 2013 was attributable to lower operating overhead and demand creation spending. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011  During fiscal 2012, the macroeconomic environment in Japan remained uncertain as the market continued to recover from the effects of the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in March 2011. On a currency neutral basis, footwear revenue in Japan increased 3% for fiscal 2012, as growth in Running and Football (Soccer) more than offset a decline in Sportswear. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, apparel revenue decreased 1% for fiscal 2012, as the decline in Sportswear more than offset the growth in Running and Football (Soccer). On a reported basis, EBIT for Japan grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of improved gross margin and leverage of selling and administrative expenses. The increase in Japans gross margin was mainly driven by the favorable impact from the year-over-year change in standard currency rates, a decrease in inventory obsolescence expense as well as a lower mix of close-out sales. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher product input costs.

Constant currency footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2013 was driven by growth in most key categories, most notably Running, Football (Soccer), and Women ' s Training. Unit sales increased approximately 9% and average selling price per pair increased 6%, primarily driven by selling price increases. Fiscal 2013 constant currency apparel revenue was driven by growth in every key category, led by Football (Soccer), Running, Sportswear, and Men ' s Training. Unit sales increased approximately 10% and average selling price per unit increased 9%, largely attributable to price increases. Fiscal 2013 Emerging Markets EBIT grew faster than revenue primarily driven by gross margin improvement, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue. Gross margin increased 260 basis points due largely to the favorable impact of price increases, the anniversary of a one-time custom duty charge in fiscal 2012, and favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, which more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher product costs. As a percent of revenue, selling and administrative expense was higher due to higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion of our Direct to Consumer business and overall growth of the business. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011  Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for the Emerging Markets increased 26% for fiscal 2012 as all territories in the geography reported double-digit revenue growth, led by Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Korea. For fiscal 2012, revenue growth for both footwear and apparel in the Emerging Markets was driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales and mid-single-digit percentage growth in average selling price per unit, primarily reflective of product price increases. The overall increase in Emerging Markets footwear and apparel sales was driven by strong demand in nearly all key categories, led by Running and Sportswear. The increase in Emerging Markets EBIT for fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage, which more than offset a lower gross margin. Gross margin declined 150 basis points for the fiscal year, primarily due to higher product input costs, customs duty charges and inventory obsolescence expense. These factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in standard currency exchange rates and product price increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues decreased 140 basis points, as both demand creation expense and operating overhead grew at a slower rate than revenues.

Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  For fiscal 2013, Global Brand Divisions ' loss before interest and taxes increased $196 million, primarily driven by increased investments and marketing support for our digital business, product creation and design initiatives and higher demand creation spending in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 around the Olympics and European Football Championships. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011  For fiscal 2012, Global Brand Divisions loss before interest and taxes increased $229 million, primarily driven by increased investments in our digital business and infrastructure for our Direct to Consumer operations, higher sports marketing expense as well as higher personnel costs to support our global brand functions.

Other Businesses revenue growth in fiscal 2013 reflects growth in each of our Other Businesses. Revenue growth at Converse was primarily driven by increased sales in the UK as well as in China, as we transitioned that market to direct distribution in the second half of fiscal 2012. The increase in fiscal 2013 revenue for NIKE Golf was driven by double-digit growth in each of our apparel, footwear, and club businesses. The fiscal 2013 increase in EBIT for our Other Businesses was driven by improved profits for all of our Other Businesses. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011  For fiscal 2012, revenues for our Other Businesses increased 12%, reflecting growth across most businesses, led by Converse. The revenue growth at Converse was primarily driven by increased sales in North America and China, as well as increased revenues in the U.K. as we transitioned that market to direct distribution in the second half of fiscal 2011. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for NIKE Golf increased 9% for fiscal 2012, driven by double-digit percentage growth in our apparel business, partially offset by a single-digit percentage decline in our club business. On a reported basis, revenues for our Other Businesses increased 13% for fiscal 2012, while EBIT grew 9%, as earnings growth at Converse was partially off-set by losses at Hurley. Higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues negatively affected profitability and lower gross margins contributed to the decline in Hurley's earnings.

Corporate loss before interest and taxes consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses; certain intercompany eliminations and other items. In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results included in gross margin are gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses and related foreign currency hedge results. All other foreign currency related results, including conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies and certain foreign currency derivative instruments, are included in other (income) expense, net. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  For fiscal 2013, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased by $260 million primarily due to the following: ##TABLE_START  A $165 million increase in foreign exchange losses related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses, net of hedge gains; these losses are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  A $48 million decrease in foreign currency net losses, reported as a component of consolidated other (income) expense, net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  A $143 million increase in corporate overhead expense related to corporate initiatives to support the growth of the business and performance-based compensation .  ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011  For fiscal 2012, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes grew $112 million, mainly due to an increase of $49 million in performance-based compensation and a year-over-year net increase of $73 million from foreign currency impacts. These foreign currency impacts were driven by a year-over-year increase in foreign currency net losses, arising from certain Euro/U.S. Dollar foreign currency hedges and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in various non-functional currencies, net of related undesignated forward instruments, as a variety of foreign currencies weakened against the U.S.  Dollar year-over-year. The above impacts were partially offset by a slight decrease in centrally managed operating overhead expenses. ##TABLE_START Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices ##TABLE_ENDOverview As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (\"NTC\") and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Transactional exposures We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: ##TABLE_START  Product Costs  NIKEs product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. ##TABLE_END In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost. ##TABLE_START 2. Factory input costs: In January 2012, NIKE implemented a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. ##TABLE_END For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories and is recognized in cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through other (income) expense, net . Refer to Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives for additional detail. As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKEs U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost. ##TABLE_START  Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales  A portion of our Western Europe and Central  Eastern Europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Costs  Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, intercompany royalties and other intercompany charges, also generate foreign currency risk though to a lesser extent. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities  Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, which may create fluctuations in other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations. ##TABLE_END Managing transactional exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below.. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements and Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end. Translational exposures Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to OCI within shareholders equity. In the translation of our consolidated statements of income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues was a benefit (detriment) of approximately $(605) million and $268 million for the years ended May 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes was a benefit (detriment) of approximately $(104) million and $74 million for the years ended May 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Managing translational exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements and Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end. We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $56 million on our income before income taxes for the year ended May 31, 2013 and had an insignificant impact for the year ended May 31, 2012. Net investments in foreign subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net . The impact of ineffective hedges was not material for any period presented. To minimize credit risk, we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration. Upon maturity, the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in OCI. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2013 and 2012. Cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled $22 million for the year ended May 31, 2012. ##TABLE_START Liquidity and Capital Resources ##TABLE_ENDCash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $3.0 billion for fiscal 2013 compared to $1.9 billion for fiscal 2012 . Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2013 was net income of $2.5 billion . Our fiscal 2013 change in working capital was a net cash outflow of $42 million , which is exclusive of working capital amounts sold as part of the divestitures of Umbro and Cole Haan, as compared to a net cash outflow of $799 million for fiscal 2012 . Our investments in working capital decreased due to slowing growth in inventory and reductions in accounts receivable compared to the prior year. During fiscal 2013 , inventory for continuing operations increased 7% compared to a 23% increase for fiscal 2012 ; the slowing growth was driven by our continued focus on increasing inventory productivity. The reduction in accounts receivable was primarily driven by the collection of receivables related to discontinued operations. Cash used by investing activities was $1,067 million during fiscal 2013 , compared to a $514 million source of cash for fiscal 2012 . A major driver of the change was the swing from net sales/maturities of short-term investments in fiscal 2012 to net purchases of short-term investments in fiscal 2013, reflective of the additional purchases of short-term investments made with the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in April 2013. In fiscal 2012, there were $1,124 million of net sales/maturities of short-term investments (net of purchases), while in fiscal 2013 we made $1,203 million in net purchases of short-term investments (net of sales/maturities). This impact was partially offset by $786 million in proceeds from the sale of Umbro and Cole Haan in fiscal 2013. Cash used by financing activities was $1,040 million for fiscal 2013 compared to $2,118 million for fiscal 2012 . The decrease in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to $986 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in April 2013. Also contributing to the decrease were lower payments of long-term debt and notes payable and lower repurchases of common stock, which were partially offset by a reduction in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options. In fiscal 2013 , we purchased 33.5 million shares of NIKEs class B common stock for $1.7 billion , an average price of $49.50. During the year, we completed the four-year, $5 billion share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2008. Under that program, we purchased a total of 118.8 million shares at an average price of $42.08 . Subsequently, we began repurchases under a four-year, $8 billion program approved by the Board in September 2012. As of the end of fiscal 2013 , we had repurchased 15.3 million shares at a cost of $789 million under this current program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Capital Resources On April 23, 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement (the \"Shelf\") with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities. The Shelf expires on April 23, 2017. On April 23, 2013, we issued $1.0 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043. The 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 2.25% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2023. The 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.625% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2043. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of $998 million. We will use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to, discharging or refinancing debt, working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, as yet unplanned acquisitions of assets or businesses and investments in subsidiaries. On November 1, 2011, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with lender approval. The facility matures November 1, 2016, with a one-year extension option prior to both the second and third anniversary of the closing date, provided that extensions shall not extend beyond November 1, 2018. As of and for the year ended May 31, 2013 , we had no amounts outstanding under our committed credit facility. We currently have long-term debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2013 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. During the year ended May 31, 2013 , we issued and subsequently repaid commercial paper borrowings of $505 million . As of May 31, 2013 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this program. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2014 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. As of May 31, 2013 , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $6.0 billion , of which $3.5 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2013 the average duration of our short-term investments and cash equivalents portfolio is 98 days. Despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets, to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the U.S., we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the U.S. through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the U.S. through debt, we would incur additional interest expense . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2013 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: ##TABLE_START Description of Commitment  Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, (In millions)       Thereafter  Total Operating Leases  $  $  $  $  $  $  $ 2,360 Capital Leases          Long-term Debt       1,525  1,949 Endorsement Contracts (1)        3,603 Product Purchase Obligations (2)  3,273            3,273 Other (3)        TOTAL  $ 5,010  $ 1,293  $ 1,108  $  $  $ 2,918  $ 11,815 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. ##TABLE_END In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. ##TABLE_START (2) We generally order product at least 4 to 5 months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2013 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2013 . ##TABLE_END The total liability for uncertain tax positions was $447 million , excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2013 . We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2013 . Refer to Note 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. ##TABLE_START (In millions) Outstanding as of May 31, 2013 Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand $ Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2013 , letters of credit of $149 million were outstanding, which were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Companys performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. ##TABLE_START Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ##TABLE_ENDIn July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued an accounting standards update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. This accounting standard update will be effective for us beginning June 1, 2013, and early adoption is permitted. We early adopted this standard and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2011, the FASB issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment. This guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards. This new guidance was effective for us beginning June 1, 2012. The adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. This new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders equity. Companies are now required to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. This requirement was effective for us beginning June 1, 2012. As this guidance only amended the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Further, this guidance required companies to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. This requirement will be effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. ##TABLE_START Recently Issued Accounting Standards ##TABLE_ENDIn December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entitys right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. This new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements. This new guidance is effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. ##TABLE_START Critical Accounting Policies ##TABLE_ENDOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers, and estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales.  Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the assets net book value to its salvage value. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets  We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. We may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any. We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Fair Value Measurements For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, including U.S. Treasury securities. In the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as commercial paper and bonds, U.S. agency securities and money market funds. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our available-for-sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments, as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include an analysis of period-over-period fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income, rather than net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in fair values of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income to other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which such changes occur. We have used and may, in the future, use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity, to the extent effective, to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported directly to earnings in the period in which changes occur. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. On a quarterly basis, we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other (income) expense, net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, and may in the future, also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements. The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Generally, hedged transactions are expected to be recognized within 12 to 18 months. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. See section Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices under Item 7 for additional detail. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixed rate debt. ##TABLE_START Market Risk Measurement ##TABLE_ENDWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk (VaR). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $34 million and $21 million at May 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-year as a result of an increase in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio combined with a longer average duration on our outstanding trades at May 31, 2013. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $49 million and $87 million during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows. Details of third-party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates at May 31, 2013. ##TABLE_START   Expected Maturity Date Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions)       Thereafter  Total  Fair Value Foreign Exchange Risk                 Japanese Yen Functional Currency                 Long-term Japanese Yen debt  Fixed rate                 Principal payments  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $ Average interest rate  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %   Interest Rate Risk                 Japanese Yen Functional Currency                 Long-term Japanese Yen debt  Fixed rate                 Principal payments  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $ Average interest rate  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %   U.S. Dollar Functional Currency                 Long-term U.S. Dollar debt  Fixed rate swapped to Floating rate                 Principal payments  $   $   $  $   $   $   $  $ Average interest rate  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.4 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.4 %   Long-term U.S. Dollar debt  Fixed rate                 Principal payments  $  $  $  $  $  $ 1,000  $ 1,109  $ 1,057 Average interest rate  4.7 %  6.4 %  6.4 %  6.2 %  6.8 %  2.9 %  3.2 %   ##TABLE_ENDThe fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries.

The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles we considered appropriate in the circumstances and include some amounts based on our best estimates and judgments. Other financial information in this report is consistent with these financial statements. Our accounting systems include controls designed to reasonably assure assets are safeguarded from unauthorized use or disposition and provide for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These systems are supplemented by the selection and training of qualified financial personnel and an organizational structure providing for appropriate segregation of duties. An Internal Audit department reviews the results of its work with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, presently consisting of three outside directors. The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews with the independent registered public accounting firm, management and the internal audit staff, the scope and the results of the annual examination, the effectiveness of the accounting control system and other matters relating to the financial affairs of NIKE as the Audit Committee deems appropriate. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have full access to the Committee, with and without the presence of management, to discuss any appropriate matters. ##TABLE_START Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting ##TABLE_END Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect on the financial statements. While reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, it does not mean absolute assurance. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatement and instance of fraud. Controls are susceptible to manipulation, especially in instances of fraud caused by the collusion of two or more people, including our senior management. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2013 . PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited (1) the consolidated financial statements and (2) the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2013 , as stated in their report herein.  ##TABLE_START Mark G. Parker Donald W. Blair President and Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ##TABLE_END To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NIKE, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries at May 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the appendix appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /S/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP Portland, Oregon July 23, 2013   ##TABLE_START NIKE, Inc.

Wholly-owned NIKE, Inc. subsidiaries include Converse Inc., which designs, markets and distributes casual footwear, apparel and accessories and Hurley International LLC, which designs, markets and distributes action sports and youth lifestyle footwear, apparel and accessories. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company completed the sale of Cole Haan during the third quarter ended February 28, 2013 and completed the sale of Umbro during the second quarter ended November 30, 2012. As a result, the Company reports the operating results of Cole Haan and Umbro in the net income (loss) from discontinued operations line in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. In addition, the assets and liabilities associated with these businesses are reported as assets of discontinued operations and liabilities of discontinued operations, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets (refer to Note 15  Discontinued Operations). Unless otherwise indicated, the disclosures accompanying the consolidated financial statements reflect the Companys continuing operations. On November 15, 2012, the Company announced a two -for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common shares. The stock split was a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 24, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business December 10, 2012. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 26, 2012. All share numbers and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. Recognition of Revenues Wholesale revenues are recognized when title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. This occurs upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims from customers are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale. Post-invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. Estimates of discretionary discounts, returns and claims are based on historical rates, specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers, and estimated discounts, returns and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers. As of May 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Companys reserve balances for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims were $531 million and $455 million , respectively. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses, and research, design and development costs. Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in cost of sales. Operating Overhead Expense Operating overhead expense consists primarily of payroll and benefit related costs, rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services, and meetings and travel. Demand Creation Expense Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, television, digital and print advertising, brand events, and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run. Advertising placement costs are expensed in the month the advertising appears, while costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is completed and delivered. A significant amount of the Companys promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. Accounting for endorsement payments is based upon specific contract provisions. Generally, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract after giving recognition to periodic performance compliance provisions of the contracts. Prepayments made under contracts are included in prepaid expenses or other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). The Company records selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are recorded in selling and administrative expense when the Company determines that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be recorded in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. The Company expenses these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, the Company offers minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which the Company estimates it will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, the Company records the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Through cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses retail customers for certain costs of advertising the Companys products. The Company records these costs in selling and administrative expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs, which is when the related revenues are recognized. This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run. Total advertising and promotion expenses were $2,745 million , $2,607 million , and $2,344 million for the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets totaled $386 million and $281 million at May 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. treasury, U.S. agency, and corporate debt securities with maturities of three months or less at date of purchase. Short-Term Investments Short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. treasury, U.S. agency, and corporate debt securities, with maturities over three months from the date of purchase. Debt securities that the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At May 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Company did not hold any short-term investments that were classified as trading or held-to-maturity. At May 31, 2013 and 2012 , short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in other comprehensive income, unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond three months at the date of purchase as current assets within short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Companys short-term investments. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts receivable from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in other assets. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $104 million and $91 million at May 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, of which $54 million and $45 million , respectively, was classified as long-term and recorded in other assets. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and valued primarily on an average cost basis. Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from our suppliers, as well as freight, import duties, taxes, insurance and logistics and other handling fees. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is determined on a straight-line basis for buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years. Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in cost of sales. Depreciation and amortization of other assets are recorded in selling and administrative expense. Software Development Costs Internal Use Software . Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 10 year period on a straight-line basis. The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed . Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test first requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the Company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, the Company measures and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any. The Company generally bases its measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that the Company expects the reporting unit to generate in the future. The Company's significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: its weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the C ompany determines that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, the Company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Operating Leases The Company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space, and other non-real estate assets under operating leases. Operating lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. Rent expense for non-cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, beginning with the effective lease commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Certain leases also provide for contingent rents, which are determined as a percentage of sales in excess of specified levels. A contingent rent liability is recognized together with the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable. Fair Value Measurements The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives and available-for-sale securities. Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach, and cost approach). The levels of hierarchy are described below: ##TABLE_START  Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. ##TABLE_END The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Pricing vendors are utilized for certain Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The Companys fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include an analysis of period-over-period fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for additional information. Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactions Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. The Companys global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement, the impact of which is recorded in other (income) expense, net, within the consolidated statements of income. Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in other comprehensive income (a component of shareholders equity), debt or net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge, and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is within the cash provided by operations component of the consolidated statements of cash flows. For designated net investment hedges, this is generally within the cash provided or used by investing activities component of the cash flow statement. As our fair value hedges are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps, the cash flows associated with these derivative instruments are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding. These cash flows are reflected within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement. Refer to Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives. Stock-Based Compensation The Company estimates the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted under the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1990 Plan) and employees purchase rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes this fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as selling and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income over the vesting period using the straight-line method. Refer to Note 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for more information on the Companys stock programs. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. United States income taxes are provided currently on financial statement earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are expected to be repatriated. The Company determines annually the amount of undistributed non-U.S. earnings to invest indefinitely in its non-U.S. operations. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes for further discussion. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards. Refer to Note 12  Earnings Per Share for further discussion. Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In July 2012, the FASB issued an accounting standards update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. This accounting standard update will be effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2013, and early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted this standard and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2011, the FASB issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment. This guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards. This new guidance was effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2012 and the adoption did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. This new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders equity. Companies are now required to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. This requirement was effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2012. As this guidance only amended the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, the adoption did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. Further, this guidance required companies to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. This requirement will be effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, the Company does not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entitys right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. This new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the Company does not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. ##TABLE_START NOTE 2  Inventories ##TABLE_ENDInventory balances of $3,434 million and $3,222 million at May 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, were substantially all finished goods. ##TABLE_START NOTE 3  Property, Plant and Equipment ##TABLE_ENDProperty, plant and equipment included the following: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   Land  $  $ Buildings  1,174  1,158 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software  2,985  2,654 Leasehold improvements   Construction in process   Total property, plant and equipment, gross  5,500  5,057 Less accumulated depreciation  3,048  2,848 TOTAL PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET  $ 2,452  $ 2,209 ##TABLE_ENDCapitalized interest was not material for the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 .

The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates, and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and that of its counterparties. Adjustments relating to these nonperformance risks were not material at May 31, 2013 or 2012 . Refer to Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives for additional detail. Available-for-sale securities comprise investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, money market funds, corporate commercial paper and bonds. These securities are valued using market prices on both active markets (Level 1) and less active markets (Level 2). Pricing vendors are utilized for certain Level 1 or Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for short-term investments and cash and equivalents approximate fair value. The Companys Level 3 assets comprise investments in certain non-marketable preferred stock. These investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. These Level 3 investments are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. Changes in Level 3 investment assets were immaterial during the years ended May 31, 2013 and 2012. No transfers among the levels within the fair value hierarchy occurred during the years ended May 31, 2013 or 2012 . As of May 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Company had no assets or liabilities that were required to be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Short-Term Investments As of May 31, 2013 and 2012 , short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale securities. As of May 31, 2013 , the Company held $2,229 million of available-for-sale securities with maturity dates within one year from the purchase date and $399 million with maturity dates over one year and less than five years from the purchase date within short-term investments. As of May 31, 2012 , the Company held $ 1,129 million of available-for-sale securities with maturity dates within one year from purchase date and $ 311 million with maturity dates over one year and less than five years from purchase date within short-term investments. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale consist of the following at fair value: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   Available-for-sale investments:     U.S. treasury and agencies  $ 1,984  $ 1,157 Commercial paper and bonds   TOTAL AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS  $ 2,628  $ 1,440 ##TABLE_ENDIncluded in interest (income) expense, net was interest income related to cash and equivalents and short-term investments of $26 million , $27 million , and $28 million for the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively.

The Company purchases through Sojitz America certain athletic footwear, apparel and equipment it acquires from non-U.S. suppliers. These purchases are for the Companys operations outside of the United States, Europe and Japan. Accounts payable to Sojitz America are generally due up to 60 days after shipment of goods from the foreign port. The interest rate on such accounts payable is the 60-day London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as of the beginning of the month of the invoice date, plus 0.75% . As of May 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Company had no amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program. In November 2011, the Company entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings pursuant to a revolving credit facility with the option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with lender approval. The facility matures on November 1, 2016 , with a one -year extension option prior to both the second and third anniversary of the closing date, provided that extensions shall not extend beyond November 1, 2018 . Based on the Companys current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.56% . The facility fee is 0.065% of the total commitment. Under this committed credit facility, the Company must maintain, among other things, certain minimum specified financial ratios with which the Company was in compliance at May 31, 2013 . No amounts were outstanding under this facility as of May 31, 2013 or 2012 . ##TABLE_START NOTE 8  Long-Term Debt ##TABLE_ENDLong-term debt, net of unamortized premiums and discounts and swap fair value adjustments, comprises the following:  ##TABLE_START         Book Value Outstanding As of May 31, Scheduled Maturity (Dollars in millions)  Original Principal  Interest Rate  Interest Payments   Corporate Bond Payables: (4)           July 23, 2012 (1)  $  5.66 %  Semi-Annually  $   $ August 7, 2012 (1)  $  5.40 %  Semi-Annually    October 1, 2013  $  4.70 %  Semi-Annually   October 15, 2015 (1)  $  5.15 %  Semi-Annually   May 1, 2023 (5)  $  2.25 %  Semi-Annually    May 1, 2043 (5)  $  3.63 %  Semi-Annually    Promissory Notes: (2)           April 1, 2017  $  6.20 %  Monthly    January 1, 2018  $  6.79 %  Monthly    Japanese Yen Notes:           August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020 (3)   9,000  2.60 %  Quarterly   August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020 (3)   4,000  2.00 %  Quarterly   Total        1,267  Less current maturities         TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT        $ 1,210  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby the Company receives fixed interest payments at the same rate as the note and pays variable interest payments based on the six-month LIBOR plus a spread. The swaps have the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding note. At May 31, 2013 , the interest rates payable on these swap agreements ranged from approximately 0.3% to 0.4% . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) The Company assumed a total of $59 million in bonds payable on May 30, 2013 as part of its agreement to purchase certain Corporate properties, which was treated as a non-cash financing transaction. The property serves as collateral for the debt. The purchase of these properties was accounted for as a business combination where the total consideration of $85 million was allocated to the land and buildings acquired; no other tangible or intangible assets or liabilities resulted from the purchase.

The fair value of the Companys long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $1,219 million at May 31, 2013 and $283 million at May 31, 2012 . The fair value of long-term debt is estimated based upon quoted prices of similar instruments (level 2). ##TABLE_START NOTE 9  Income Taxes ##TABLE_ENDIncome before income taxes is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Income before income taxes:       United States  $ 1,240  $  $ 1,040 Foreign  2,032  2,221  1,822 TOTAL INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  $ 3,272  $ 3,025  $ 2,862 ##TABLE_ENDThe provision for income taxes is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Current:       United States       Federal  $  $  $ State    Foreign    Total    Deferred:       United States       Federal   (48 )  (62 ) State  (4 )    Foreign  (90 )  (29 )  (38 ) Total  (93 )  (72 )  (100 ) TOTAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDA reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,      Federal income tax rate  35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % State taxes, net of federal benefit  1.4 %  1.3 %  1.3 % Foreign earnings  -11.8 %  -11.9 %  -11.4 % Other, net  0.1 %  0.6 %  -0.8 % EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE  24.7 %  25.0 %  24.1 % ##TABLE_ENDThe effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended May 31, 2013 was 30 basis points lower than the effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended May 31, 2012 primarily due to tax benefits received from the intercompany sale of intellectual property rights outside of the U.S., the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development credit and the intra-period allocation of tax expense between continuing operations, discontinued operations, and other comprehensive income. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a higher effective tax rate on operations as a result of an increase in earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended May 31, 2012 was 90 basis points higher than the effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended May 31, 2011 primarily due to the changes in uncertain tax positions partially offset by a reduction in the effective rate related to a decrease in earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets and (liabilities) comprise the following:  ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   Deferred tax assets:     Allowance for doubtful accounts  $  $ Inventories   Sales return reserves   Deferred compensation   Stock-based compensation   Reserves and accrued liabilities   Foreign loss carry-forwards   Foreign tax credit carry-forwards   Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries   Other   Total deferred tax assets   Valuation allowance  (5 )  (27 ) Total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance   Deferred tax liabilities:     Property, plant and equipment  (241 )  (191 ) Intangibles  (96 )  (98 ) Other  (20 )  (22 ) Total deferred tax liability  (357 )  (311 ) NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe following is a reconciliation of the changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)    Unrecognized tax benefits, as of the beginning of the period  $  $  $ Gross increases related to prior period tax positions    Gross decreases related to prior period tax positions  (3 )  (25 )  (98 ) Gross increases related to current period tax positions    Gross decreases related to current period tax positions  (9 )  (1 )  (6 ) Settlements    (20 )  (43 ) Lapse of statute of limitations  (21 )  (9 )  (8 ) Changes due to currency translation  (12 )  (11 )  UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2013 , the total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were $447 million , $281 million of which would affect the Company's effective tax rate if recognized in future periods. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The liability for payment of interest and penalties increased $4 million , $17 million , and $10 million during the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively. As of May 31, 2013 and 2012 , accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions was $112 million and $108 million , respectively (excluding federal benefit). The Company is subject to taxation primarily in the U.S., China, the Netherlands, and Brazil, as well as various state and other foreign jurisdictions. The Company has concluded substantially all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2010. The Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2011 through 2013 tax years. Many issues are at an advanced stage in the examination process, the most significant of which includes the negotiation of a U.S. Unilateral Advanced Pricing Agreement that covers intercompany transfer pricing issues for fiscal years May 31, 2011 through May 31, 2015. In addition, the Company is in appeals regarding the validation of foreign tax credits taken. The Companys major foreign jurisdictions, China, the Netherlands and Brazil, have concluded substantially all income tax matters through calendar 2005, fiscal 2007 and calendar 2006, respectively. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in the aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $86 million within the next 12 months. We provide for United States income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At May 31, 2013, the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately $6.7 billion . If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences of undistributed earnings would be approximately $2.2 billion at May 31, 2013 . A portion of the Company's foreign operations are benefiting from a tax holiday, which will phase out in 2019 . This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The impact of this tax holiday decreased foreign taxes by $108 million , $117 million , and $36 million for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on net income per share (diluted) was $0.12 , $0.12 , and $0.04 for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively. Deferred tax assets at May 31, 2013 and 2012 were reduced by a valuation allowance relating to tax benefits of certain subsidiaries with operating losses. The net change in the valuation allowance was a decrease of $22 million , an increase of $23 million , and a decrease of $1 million for the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011, respectively. The Company does not anticipate that any foreign tax credit carry-forwards will expire unutilized. The Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of $58 million at May 31, 2013 . Such losses will expire as follows:  ##TABLE_START   Year Ending May 31, (In millions)      2018- 2032  Indefinite  Total Net Operating Losses  $          $ ##TABLE_ENDDuring the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , income tax benefits attributable to employee stock-based compensation transactions of $76 million , $120 million , and $68 million , respectively, were allocated to shareholders equity. ##TABLE_START NOTE 10  Redeemable Preferred Stock ##TABLE_ENDSojitz America is the sole owner of the Companys authorized Redeemable Preferred Stock, $1 par value, which is redeemable at the option of Sojitz America or the Company at par value aggregating $0.3 million . A cumulative dividend of $0.10 per share is payable annually on May 31 and no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock of the Company unless dividends on the Redeemable Preferred Stock have been declared and paid in full. There have been no changes in the Redeemable Preferred Stock in the three years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 . As the holder of the Redeemable Preferred Stock, Sojitz America does not have general voting rights but does have the right to vote as a separate class on the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, on merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company or on the sale or assignment of the NIKE trademark for athletic footwear sold in the United States. The Redeemable Preferred Stock has been fully issued to Sojitz America and is not blank check preferred stock. The Company's articles of incorporation do not permit the issuance of additional preferred stock. ##TABLE_START NOTE 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation ##TABLE_ENDThe authorized number of shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value, and Class B Common Stock, no par value, are 200 million and 1,200 million , respectively. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors. There are no differences in the dividend and liquidation preferences or participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shareholders. In 1990, the Board of Directors adopted, and the shareholders approved, the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1990 Plan). The 1990 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 326 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with stock options and other awards granted under the plan. The 1990 Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance-based awards. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the 1990 Plan. The committee has the authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards, and the other terms and conditions of the awards. Substantially all stock option grants outstanding under the 1990 Plan were granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year, vest ratably over four years, and expire 10 years from the date of grant. The following table summarizes the Companys total stock-based compensation expense recognized in selling and administrative expense:  ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Stock options (1)  $  $  $ ESPPs    Restricted stock    TOTAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Expense for stock options includes the expense associated with stock appreciation rights. Accelerated stock option expense is recorded for employees eligible for accelerated stock option vesting upon retirement. Accelerated stock option expense for years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 was $22 million , $17 million , and $12 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END As of May 31, 2013 , the Company had $199 million of unrecognized compensation costs from stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, to be recognized as selling and administrative expense over a weighted average period of 2.3 years. The weighted average fair value per share of the options granted during the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , as computed using the Black-Scholes pricing model, was $12.71 , $11.08 , and $8.84 , respectively. The weighted average assumptions used to estimate these fair values are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,      Dividend yield  1.5 %  1.4 %  1.6 % Expected volatility  35.0 %  29.5 %  31.5 % Weighted average expected life (in years)  5.3  5.0  5.0 Risk-free interest rate  0.6 %  1.4 %  1.7 % ##TABLE_ENDThe Company estimates the expected volatility based on the implied volatility in market traded options on the Companys common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. The weighted average expected life of options is based on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns. The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rate in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the options. The following summarizes the stock option transactions under the plan discussed above:  ##TABLE_START   Shares (1)  Weighted Average Option Price    (In millions)    Options outstanding May 31, 2010  72.2  $ 23.30 Exercised  (14.0 )  21.35 Forfeited  (1.3 )  29.03 Granted  12.7  34.60 Options outstanding May 31, 2011  69.6  $ 25.65 Exercised  (18.0 )  22.81 Forfeited  (1.0 )  35.61 Granted  13.7  45.87 Options outstanding May 31, 2012  64.3  $ 30.59 Exercised  (9.9 )  24.70 Forfeited  (1.3 )  40.14 Granted  14.6  46.55 Options outstanding May 31, 2013  67.7  $ 34.72 Options exercisable at May 31,      40.1  $ 22.03  33.9  24.38  35.9  27.70 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Includes stock appreciation rights transactions. ##TABLE_END The weighted average contractual life remaining for options outstanding and options exercisable at May 31, 2013 was 6.3 years and 4.7 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable at May 31, 2013 was $1,823 million and $1,218 million , respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value was the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of the options. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 was $293 million , $453 million , and $267 million , respectively. In addition to the 1990 Plan, the Company gives employees the right to purchase shares at a discount to the market price under employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs). Employees are eligible to participate through payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation. At the end of each six -month offering period, shares are purchased by the participants at 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or the end of the offering period. Employees purchased 1.6 million , 1.7 million , and 1.6 million shares during each of the three years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. From time to time, the Company grants restricted stock units and restricted stock to key employees under the 1990 Plan. The number of shares underlying such awards granted to employees during the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 were 1.6 million , 0.7 million , and 0.4 million with weighted average values per share of $46.86 , $49.49 , and $35.11 , respectively. Recipients of restricted stock are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respective shares throughout the period of restriction. Recipients of restricted stock units are entitled to dividend equivalent cash payments upon vesting. The value of all grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units was established by the market price on the date of grant. During the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , the aggregate fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested was $25 million , $22 million , and $15 million , respectively, determined as of the date of vesting. ##TABLE_START NOTE 12  Earnings Per Share ##TABLE_ENDThe following is a reconciliation from basic earnings per share to diluted earnings per share. Options to purchase an additional 0.1 million , 0.2 million , and 0.3 million shares of common stock were outstanding at May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options were anti-dilutive.  ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions, except per share data)    Determination of shares:       Weighted average common shares outstanding  897.3  920.0  951.1 Assumed conversion of dilutive stock options and awards  19.1  19.6  20.2 DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING  916.4  939.6  971.3        Earnings per share from continuing operations:       Basic earnings per common share  $ 2.75  $ 2.47  $ 2.28 Diluted earnings per common share  $ 2.69  $ 2.42  $ 2.24        Earnings per share from discontinued operations:       Basic earnings per common share  $ 0.02  $ (0.05 )  $ (0.04 ) Diluted earnings per common share  $ 0.02  $ (0.05 )  $ (0.04 )        Basic earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc.  $ 2.77  $ 2.42  $ 2.24 Diluted earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc.  $ 2.71  $ 2.37  $ 2.20 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START NOTE 13  Benefit Plans ##TABLE_ENDThe Company has a profit sharing plan available to most U.S.-based employees. The terms of the plan call for annual contributions by the Company as determined by the Board of Directors. A subsidiary of the Company also had a profit sharing plan available to its U.S.-based employees prior to fiscal 2012. The terms of the plan called for annual contributions as determined by the subsidiarys executive management. Contributions of $47 million , $40 million , and $39 million were made to the plans and are included in selling and administrative expense for the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively. The Company has various 401(k) employee savings plans available to U.S.-based employees. The Company matches a portion of employee contributions. Company contributions to the savings plans were $46 million , $42 million , and $38 million for the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively, and are included in selling and administrative expense. The Company also has a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) that was adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by shareholders in September 1997 and later amended in fiscal 2007. The Company recognized $50 million , $51 million , and $31 million of selling and administrative expense related to cash awards under the LTIP during the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively. The Company has pension plans in various countries worldwide. The pension plans are only available to local employees and are generally government mandated. The liability related to the unfunded pension liabilities of the plans was $104 million and $113 million at May 31, 2013 and May 31, 2012 , respectively, which was primarily classified as long-term in other liabilities. ##TABLE_START NOTE 14  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ##TABLE_ENDThe components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, are as follows: ##TABLE_START   May 31 (In millions)   Cumulative translation adjustment and other  $ (14 )  $ (127 ) Net deferred gain on cash flow hedge derivatives   Net deferred gain on net investment hedge derivatives   ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDRefer to Note 17 Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Company's risk management program and derivatives. ##TABLE_START NOTE 15  Discontinued Operations ##TABLE_ENDThe Company continually evaluates its existing portfolio of businesses to ensure resources are invested in those businesses that are accretive to the NIKE Brand and represent the largest growth potential and highest returns. During the year, the Company divested of Umbro and Cole Haan, allowing it to focus its resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands. On February 1, 2013, the Company completed the sale of Cole Haan to Apax Partners for an agreed upon purchase price of $570 million and received at closing $561 million , net of $9 million of purchase price adjustments. The transaction resulted in a gain on sale of $231 million , net of $137 million in tax expense; this gain is included in the net income (loss) from discontinued operations line item on the consolidated statements of income. There were no adjustments to these recorded amounts as of May 31, 2013 . Beginning November 30, 2012, the Company classified the Cole Haan disposal group as held-for-sale and presented the results of Cole Haan's operations in the net income (loss) from discontinued operations line item on the consolidated statements of income. From this date until the sale, the assets and liabilities of Cole Haan were recorded in the assets of discontinued operations and liabilities of discontinued operations line items on the consolidated balance sheets, respectively. Previously, these amounts were reported in the Company's segment presentation as Other Businesses. Under the sale agreement, the Company agreed to provide certain transition services to Cole Haan for an expected period of 3 to 9 months from the date of sale. The Company will also license NIKE proprietary Air and Lunar technologies to Cole Haan for a transition period. The continuing cash flows related to these items are not expected to be significant to Cole Haan and the Company will have no significant continuing involvement with Cole Haan beyond the transition services. Additionally, preexisting guarantees of certain Cole Haan lease payments remain in place after the sale; the maximum exposure under the guarantees is $ 44 million at May 31, 2013 . The fair value of the guarantees is not material. On November 30, 2012, the Company completed the sale of certain assets of Umbro to Iconix Brand Group (Iconix) for $ 225 million . The Umbro disposal group was classified as held-for-sale as of November 30, 2012 and the results of Umbro's operations are presented in the net income (loss) from discontinued operations line item on the consolidated statements of income. The remaining liabilities of Umbro are recorded in the liabilities of discontinued operations line items on the consolidated balance sheets. Previously, these amounts were reported in the Company's segment presentation as Other Businesses. Upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria, the Company recorded a loss of $ 107 million , net of tax, on the sale of Umbro and the loss is included in the net income (loss) from discontinued operations line item on the consolidated statements of income. The loss on sale was calculated as the net sales price less Umbro assets of $ 248 million , including intangibles, goodwill, and fixed assets, other miscellaneous charges of $ 22 million , and the release of the associated cumulative translation adjustment of $ 129 million . The tax benefit on the loss was $ 67 million . There were no adjustments to these recorded amounts as of May 31, 2013 . Under the sale agreement, the Company provided transition services to Iconix while certain markets were transitioned to Iconix-designated licensees. These transition services are complete and the Company has wound down the remaining operations of Umbro. For the year ended May 31, 2013 , net income (loss) from discontinued operations included, for both businesses, the net gain or loss on sale, net operating losses, tax expenses, and approximately $ 20 million in wind down costs. Summarized results of the Company's discontinued operations are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Revenues  $  $  $ Income (loss) before income taxes   (43 )  (18 ) Income tax expense (benefit)    Net income (loss) from discontinued operations  $  $ (46 )  $ (39 ) ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2013 and 2012 , the aggregate components of assets and liabilities classified as discontinued operations and included in current assets and current liabilities consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   Accounts Receivable, net  $   $ Inventories    Deferred income taxes and other assets    Property, plant and equipment, net    Identifiable intangible assets, net    TOTAL ASSETS  $   $ Accounts payable  $  $ Accrued liabilities   Deferred income taxes and other liabilities    TOTAL LIABILITIES  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START NOTE 16  Commitments and Contingencies ##TABLE_ENDThe Company leases space for certain of its offices, warehouses and retail stores under leases expiring from 1 to 21 years after May 31, 2013 . Rent expense was $482 million , $431 million , and $386 million for the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Amounts of minimum future annual rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases in each of the five years ending May 31, 2014 through 2018 are $403 million , $340 million , $304 million , $272 million , $225 million , respectively, and $816 million in later years. Amounts of minimum future annual commitments under non-cancelable capital leases in each of the four years ending May 31, 2014 through 2017 are $23 million , $28 million , $21 million , and $9 million , respectively; the Company has no capital lease obligations beyond the year ending May 31, 2017. As of May 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling $149 million and $137 million , respectively. These letters of credit were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and guarantees of the Companys performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. In connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the Companys historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of its pending legal matters with certainty, the Company does not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ##TABLE_START NOTE 17  Risk Management and Derivatives ##TABLE_ENDThe Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2013 are designated as cash flow or fair value hedges. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date. The total notional amount of outstanding derivatives as of May 31, 2013 was approximately $9 billion , which primarily comprises cash flow hedges for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. As of May  31, 2013, there were outstanding currency forward contracts with maturities up to 24 months.

Cash Flow Hedges The purpose of the Companys foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the Company from the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from transactions in foreign currencies will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Foreign currency exposures that the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external and intercompany revenues, selling and administrative expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions. Product cost exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below. NIKE entities primarily purchase products in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC; (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. In January 2012, the Company implemented a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, the Companys payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order. Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order and their accounting treatment is described further below. The Companys policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. Hedged transactions are denominated primarily in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. The Company may enter into hedge contracts typically starting up to 12 to 18 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges for up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. All changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, excluding any ineffective portion, are recorded in other comprehensive income until net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. In most cases, amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be released to net income some time after the maturity of the related derivative. Effective hedge results are classified within the consolidated statements of income in the same manner as the underlying exposure, with the results of hedges of non-functional currency denominated revenues and product cost exposures, excluding embedded derivatives as described below, recorded in revenues or cost of sales, when the underlying hedged transaction affects consolidated net income. Results of hedges of selling and administrative expense are recorded together with those costs when the related expense is recorded. Results of hedges of anticipated purchases and sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities are recorded in other (income) expense, net when the securities are sold. Results of hedges of certain anticipated intercompany transactions are recorded in other (income) expense, net when the transaction occurs. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from these designated cash flow hedge derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, generally within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement. Premiums paid on options are initially recorded as deferred charges. The Company assesses the effectiveness of options based on the total cash flows method and records total changes in the options fair value to other comprehensive income to the degree they are effective. The Company formally assesses, both at a hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Effectiveness for cash flow hedges is assessed based on forward rates. Ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it determines that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item (including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions); (2) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (3) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, but is expected to occur within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified to net income when the forecasted transaction affects consolidated net income. However, if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in other (income) expense, net . In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing future changes in the fair value in other (income) expense, net . For the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , the amounts recorded in other (income) expense, net as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedging because the forecasted transaction was no longer probable of occurring were immaterial . As of May 31, 2013 , $132 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives accumulated in other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in net income. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2013 , the maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions is 24 months. Fair Value Hedges The Company is also exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives currently used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. As of May 31, 2013 , all interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt and meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. The cash flows associated with the Companys fair value hedges are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding, which are reflected within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , or 2011 . Net Investment Hedges The Company has hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign-currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges, except ineffective portions, are reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its net investment hedges within the cash provided or used by investing component of the cash flow statement. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness based on changes in forward rates. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its net investment hedges for the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , or 2011 . Embedded Derivatives As part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order. Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related purchase order and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the balance sheet with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in other (income) expense, net from the date a purchase order is accepted by a factory through the date the purchase price is no longer subject to foreign currency fluctuations. At May 31, 2013 , the notional amount of embedded derivatives was approximately $136 million . Undesignated Derivative Instruments The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and/or the embedded derivative contracts explained above. These forwards are not designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, these undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the balance sheet with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in other (income) expense, net , together with the re-measurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position or embedded derivative contract. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from undesignated instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, generally within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement. Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. However, this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored. The Companys derivative contracts contain credit risk related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Companys bilateral credit related contingent features generally require the owing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50 million should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than $50 million . Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also trigger collateral requirements. As of May 31, 2013 , the Company was in compliance with all credit risk related contingent features and the fair value of its derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position was insignificant. Accordingly, the Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features. Further, as of May 31, 2013 those counterparties which were required to post collateral complied with such requirements. Given the considerations described above, the Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial . ##TABLE_START NOTE 18  Operating Segments and Related Information ##TABLE_ENDOperating Segments. The Companys operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Companys internal organization. The major segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity excluding NIKE Golf. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. The Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. The Companys NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment. The Companys Other category is broken into two components for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. The Global Brand Divisions category primarily represents NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment, demand creation and operating overhead expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand, and costs associated with product development and supply chain operations. The Other Businesses category consists of the activities of Converse Inc., Hurley International LLC, and NIKE Golf. Activities represented in the Other category are considered immaterial for individual disclosure. Corporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments, depreciation and amortization related to the Companys headquarters, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, including stock-based compensation, certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses, certain corporate eliminations and other items. The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (commonly referred to as EBIT), which represents net income before interest (income) expense, net and income taxes in the consolidated statements of income. Reconciling items for EBIT represent corporate expense items that are not allocated to the operating segments for management reporting. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses. These rates are set approximately nine months in advance of the future selling season based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and cost of sales for geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses reflect use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entitys functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses. Accounts receivable, inventories and property, plant and equipment for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below. Additions to long-lived assets as presented in the following table represent capital expenditures. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2013 presentation. ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    REVENUE       North America  $ 10,387  $ 8,839  $ 7,579 Western Europe  4,128  4,144  3,868 Central  Eastern Europe  1,287  1,200  1,040 Greater China  2,453  2,539  2,060 Japan    Emerging Markets  3,718  3,411  2,737 Global Brand Divisions    Total NIKE Brand  22,881  21,079  18,153 Other Businesses  2,500  2,298  2,041 Corporate  (68 )  (46 )  (77 ) TOTAL NIKE CONSOLIDATED REVENUES  $ 25,313  $ 23,331  $ 20,117 EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES       North America  $ 2,534  $ 2,030  $ 1,736 Western Europe    Central  Eastern Europe    Greater China    Japan    Emerging Markets  1,011   Global Brand Divisions  (1,396 )  (1,200 )  (971 ) Total NIKE Brand  3,990  3,561  3,318 Other Businesses    Corporate  (1,177 )  (917 )  (805 ) Total NIKE Consolidated Earnings Before Interest and Taxes  3,269  3,029  2,866 Interest (income) expense, net  (3 )   TOTAL NIKE CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS BEFORE TAXES  $ 3,272  $ 3,025  $ 2,862 ADDITIONS TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS       North America  $  $  $ Western Europe    Central  Eastern Europe    Greater China    Japan    Emerging Markets    Global Brand Divisions    Total NIKE Brand    Other Businesses    Corporate    TOTAL ADDITIONS TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS  $  $  $ DEPRECIATION       North America  $  $  $ Western Europe    Central  Eastern Europe    Greater China    Japan    Emerging Markets    Global Brand Divisions    Total NIKE Brand    Other Businesses    Corporate    TOTAL DEPRECIATION  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET     North America  $ 1,214  $ 1,149 Western Europe   Central  Eastern Europe   Greater China   Japan   Emerging Markets   Global Brand Divisions   Total NIKE Brand  2,630  2,709 Other Businesses   Corporate   TOTAL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET  $ 3,117  $ 3,132 INVENTORIES     North America  $ 1,435  $ 1,272 Western Europe   Central  Eastern Europe   Greater China   Japan   Emerging Markets   Global Brand Divisions   Total NIKE Brand  3,032  2,796 Other Businesses   Corporate   TOTAL INVENTORIES  $ 3,434  $ 3,222 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET     North America  $  $ Western Europe   Central  Eastern Europe   Greater China   Japan   Emerging Markets   Global Brand Divisions   Total NIKE Brand  1,700  1,536 Other Businesses   Corporate   TOTAL PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET  $ 2,452  $ 2,209 ##TABLE_END Revenues by Major Product Lines.

Another of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Converse, headquartered in North Andover, Massachusetts (Converse), designs, distributes, and licenses casual sneakers, apparel, and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron, and Jack Purcell trademarks. Converse results are reported on a stand-alone basis. In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our Direct to Consumer operations, we have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications, and other equipment designed for sports activities. On February 1, 2013, and November 30, 2012, we completed the divestitures of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses, respectively, allowing us to better focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse, and Hurley brands. ##TABLE_START Sales and Marketing ##TABLE_END Financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in Note 18  Operating Segments and Related Information of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel, and equipment. Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk.We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing, and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services. Our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment. Converse is also a reportable segment, and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing, and selling of casual sneakers, apparel, and accessories. ##TABLE_START United States Market ##TABLE_ENDIn fiscal 2014, NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 46% of total revenues, compared to 45% in fiscal 2013 and 42% in fiscal 2012. We sell to thousands of retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis, and golf shops, and other retail accounts. During fiscal 2014, our three largest customers accounted for approximately 26% of sales in the United States. We make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price. In fiscal 2014, 86% of our U.S. wholesale footwear shipments (excluding NIKE Golf, Hurley, and Converse) were made under the futures program, compared to 87% in fiscal 2013 and 86% in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2014, 71% of our U.S. wholesale apparel shipments (excluding NIKE Golf, Hurley, and Converse) were made under the futures program, compared to 67% in fiscal 2013 and 64% in fiscal 2012. We utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit sales in the United States, as well as independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf, skateboarding, and snowboarding. In addition, our Direct to Consumer operations sell NIKE Brand products to consumers through our e-commerce website, www.nike.com , and through the following number of retail stores in the United States: ##TABLE_START U.S. Retail Stores Number NIKE Brand factory stores NIKE Brand in-line stores, including NIKETOWNs and employee-only stores Converse stores (including factory stores) Hurley stores (including factory and employee stores) TOTAL ##TABLE_ENDNIKE has five primary distribution centers in the United States located in Memphis, Tennessee, three of which are leased. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California distribution center. Converse and Hurley products are shipped primarily from Ontario, California. ##TABLE_START International Markets ##TABLE_ENDIn fiscal 2014, non-U.S. NIKE Brand and Converse sales accounted for 54% of total revenues, compared to 55% in fiscal 2013 and 58% in fiscal 2012. We sell our products to retail accounts, through our own Direct to Consumer operations, and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees, and sales representatives around the world. We sell to thousands of retail accounts and operate 16 distribution centers outside of the United States. In many countries and regions, including Canada, Asia, some Latin American countries, and Europe, we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the United States futures ordering program described above. During fiscal 2014, NIKEs three largest customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 6% of total non-U.S. sales. Our Direct to Consumer business operates the following number of retail stores outside the United States: ##TABLE_START Non-U.S. Retail Stores Number NIKE Brand factory stores NIKE Brand in-line stores, including NIKETOWNs and employee-only stores Converse stores (including factory stores) TOTAL ##TABLE_ENDInternational branch offices and subsidiaries of NIKE are located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Uruguay, and Vietnam. ##TABLE_START Significant Customer ##TABLE_ENDNo customer accounted for 10% or more of our worldwide net sales during fiscal 2014. ##TABLE_START Orders ##TABLE_ENDWorldwide futures orders for NIKE Brand (excluding NIKE Golf and Hurley) athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from June through November 2014, were $13.3 billion compared to $12.1 billion for the same period last year. This futures orders amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders and the fulfillment of certain of these futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of discounts, order cancellations, and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including at-once and closeout sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Converse, Hurley, and NIKE Golf businesses. ##TABLE_START Product Research, Design and Development ##TABLE_ENDWe believe our research, design, and development efforts are key factors in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel, and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as NIKE strives to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury, and maximize comfort. In addition to NIKEs own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability, and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, and other experts who consult with us and review designs, materials, concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements, and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts, and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process. As we continue to develop new technologies, NIKE is simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories. Using market intelligence and research, the various NIKE design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumer preferences. The proliferation of NIKE AIR, Lunar, Shox, Free, Flywire, Dri-Fit, FlyKnit, NIKE+, and NIKE Fuel technologies through Running, Basketball, Men's Training, Women's Training, and Sportswear, among others, typifies the Company's dedication to designing innovative products. ##TABLE_START Manufacturing ##TABLE_ENDWe are supplied by approximately 150 footwear factories located in 14 countries. The largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 5% of total fiscal 2014 NIKE Brand footwear production. Virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers who often operate multiple factories. In fiscal 2014, contract factories in Vietnam, China, and Indonesia manufactured approximately 43%, 28%, and 25% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. We also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in Argentina, Brazil, India, and Mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. In fiscal 2014, five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of fiscal 2014 footwear production, and in aggregate accounted for approximately 67% of NIKE Brand footwear production in fiscal 2014. We are supplied by approximately 430 apparel factories located in 41 countries. The largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 7% of total fiscal 2014 NIKE Brand apparel production. Virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers who often operate multiple factories. In fiscal 2014, most of this apparel production occurred in China, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Malaysia. In fiscal 2014, one apparel contract manufacturer accounted for greater than 10% of fiscal 2014 apparel production, and the top five contract manufacturers in aggregate accounted for approximately 34% of NIKE Brand apparel production in fiscal 2014. The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, nylon, leather, canvas, and polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2014, NIKE IHM, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NIKE, Inc., with facilities near Beaverton, Oregon and in St. Louis, Missouri, as well as independent contractors in China and Vietnam, were our largest suppliers of the Air-Sole cushioning components used in footwear. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads (both virgin and recycled), specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat, repel rain and/or snow, as well as plastic and metal hardware. NIKEs independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel, and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. NIKE's independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products. Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed significant import-export financing services for us. During fiscal 2014, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Brazil, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, South Africa, and Thailand, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 8% of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates. Our current agreements with Sojitz America expire on May 31, 2015. ##TABLE_START International Operations and Trade ##TABLE_ENDOur international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as possible revaluation of currencies, export and import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future. In recent years, uncertain global and regional economic conditions have affected international trade and caused a rise in protectionist actions around the world.  These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, such protectionist measures, if implemented, could result in increases in the cost of our products, which may in turn adversely affect our sales or profitability as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole. We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions. In Brazil, we are actively monitoring for dumping investigations against products from China and other countries that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may increase customs clearance times for imports of footwear, apparel, and equipment. Moreover, with respect to trade restrictions targeting China, which represents an important sourcing and consumer marketing country for us, we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i)  addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii)  is consistent with international trade rules, and (iii)  reflects and considers China's domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community. Where trade protection measures are implemented, we believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability. ##TABLE_START Competition ##TABLE_ENDThe athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel, and equipment, including adidas, V.F. Corp., Puma, Li Ning, and Under Armour, among others. We also compete with a number of vertical retailers such as lululemon athletica and Uniqlo. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment in the world. Important aspects of competition in this industry are: ##TABLE_START  product quality; performance and reliability; new product innovation and development; and consumer price/value; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  consumer connection and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing and promotion; customer support and service; identification with prominent and influential athletes, coaches, teams, colleges, and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products; and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  effective distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in store and online. ##TABLE_END We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas. ##TABLE_START Trademarks and Patents ##TABLE_ENDWe utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh Design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have sought and obtained federal trademark registrations. NIKE has copyright protection in its design, graphics and other original works. When appropriate, we have sought registrations for this content. NIKE owns patents, and has a patent license, facilitating its use of Air technologies. The \"Air\" process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane. Some of the early NIKE AIR patents have expired, which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology. Subsequent NIKE AIR patents will not expire for several years. We also file and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility patents, as well as many U.S. and foreign design patents protecting components, manufacturing techniques, features, and industrial design used in various athletic and leisure footwear, apparel, athletic equipment, digital devices, and golf products. These patents expire at various times; and patents issued for applications filed this calendar year in the United States will last until 2028 for design patents and until 2034 for utility patents. We believe our success depends primarily upon our capabilities in design, research and development, production, and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patent position. However, we have followed a policy of filing patent applications for the United States and select foreign countries on inventions, designs, and improvements that we deem valuable. We continue to vigorously protect our trademarks and patents against infringement. ##TABLE_START Employees ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2014, we had approximately 56,500 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. Management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent. None of our employees are represented by a union, except for certain employees in the Emerging Markets geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into and/or comply with industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements. ##TABLE_START Executive Officers of the Registrant ##TABLE_ENDThe executive officers of NIKE, Inc. as of July 18, 2014 are as follows: Philip H.

Risk Factors Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Analyst Reports Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historic information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKEs business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports, filings with the SEC, press releases, conferences, or otherwise, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate, or imply future results, performance, or achievements, and may contain the words believe, anticipate, expect, estimate, project, will be, will continue, will likely result, or words or phrases of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and include, among others, the following: international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors, and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products, and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products; difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for NIKE products, and the various market factors described above; difficulties in implementing, operating, and maintaining NIKEs increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control; interruptions in data and information technology systems; consumer data security; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance futures orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes in shipment timing, the changing mix of futures and at-once orders, and discounts, order cancellations, and returns; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage, or forecast its growth and inventories; the size, timing, and mix of purchases of NIKEs products; increases in the cost of materials, labor, and energy used to manufacture products, new product development, and introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property; product performance and quality; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors and licensees; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in NIKE's debt ratings; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas, political and economic instability, and terrorism; changes in government regulations; the impact of, including business and legal developments relating to, climate change; natural disasters; liability and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the effects of NIKE's decision to invest in or divest of businesses; and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKEs business and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKEs business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKEs policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts, or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE. Our products face intense competition. NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. The athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry is highly competitive in the United States and on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel, and equipment. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products. Product offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, and customer service are areas of intense competition. This, in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly. Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business. Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting, and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, product innovation, and product quality. Our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design (including materials) and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity. In addition, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. Negative posts or comments about us on social networking websites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image. If we do not maintain, extend, and expand our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits. Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate, and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge, and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles, and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories, or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media and online advertising. If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our products. Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel, and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products. Research and development plays a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability, and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury, and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. Failure to continue to obtain high quality endorsers of our products could harm our business. We establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams, and leagues to develop, evaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with consumers. If certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken by athletes, teams, or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams, or leagues, could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products, or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales, and profitability. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues, higher costs, and decreased margins and earnings. A majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States. As a result, we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates globally. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected, and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities. Global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Although the global economy has been showing signs of improvement, its uncertain state continues to impact businesses around the world, and most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies. Continuing uncertainty in the global capital and credit markets have led to fluctuations in the availability of business credit and capital liquidity, a contraction of consumer credit, business failures, sustained unemployment at historically high levels, and declines in consumer confidence and spending in many parts of the world. If global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition: ##TABLE_START  Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts, increased inventories, and lower gross margins. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We conduct transactions in various currencies, which increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported financial results and condition. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum derivatives) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins, and profitability. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If retailers of our products experience declining revenues, or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts, and increased bad debt expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products. ##TABLE_END Our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel, and equipment. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules, or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, availability of import quotas, and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix, and geographic sales trends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues. We make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price. Our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory, purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders, and the risk of non-delivery. We report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports. Although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues, reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of changes in revenues for any future period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, shipping timing, returns, and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including at-once and closeout sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Converse, Hurley, and NIKE Golf businesses. Our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins, cash flows and harm to our business. We purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, and diminish brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance. We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers. We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products, we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be canceled, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties, which have had an adverse effect on our business. When the retail economy weakens, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A slowing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products. Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk, and impair our ability to sell products. The athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment retailers with many stores. These retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. These situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity, it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. In addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues. Our Direct to Consumer operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources, and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Our Direct to Consumer stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations, and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our Direct to Consumer operations, a decline in sales, or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and employee-related costs. Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Companys control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud; mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation. In addition, extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business. Risks specific to our e-commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailer's brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels, and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands. Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business. We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying us, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh Design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products and services. We believe that our trademarks, patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success, and our competitive position. We periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in challenging a partys products on the basis of trade secret misappropriation or trademark, copyright, design patent, utility patent, or other intellectual property infringement, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products. The actions we take to establish and protect trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patents, and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights. We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their trademarks, copyrights, patents, or other intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, use, importation, and/or sale of certain products. We take various actions to prevent confidential information from unauthorized use and/or disclosure. Such actions include contractual measures such as entering into non-disclosure agreements and providing confidential information awareness training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information might not always be effective. Confidential information that is related to business strategy, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results, or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, or a decline in our stock price, or a negative impact on our market position, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties, or injunctions. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results, operations or reputation. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data, misappropriation of our consumers or employees personal information, or a disruption of our business, which could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data. Any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility, and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits. Failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct, local laws, and other standards could harm our business. We work with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to manufacture our products, and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property. We require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental, health, and safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety. Notwithstanding their contractual obligations, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business. Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments, and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products. In addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts, and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets, and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs, or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust, or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations, or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries. If our capital or financing needs in the United States require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels, our effective income tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted. Current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction, including the United States, subject to significant change. There have been proposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows. Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. We and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that these transactions reflect the accurate economic allocation of profit and that the proper transfer pricing documentation is in place, the profit allocation and transfer pricing terms and conditions (required to be arm's length) may be scrutinized by local tax authorities during an audit and any resulting changes may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates. Portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings that expire in whole or in part from time to time. These tax holidays and rulings may be extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not met. If the tax holidays and rulings are not extended, or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate, then our effective tax rate would increase in the future. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. As part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars, and swaps with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterpartys liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. We rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products. NIKE is supplied by approximately 150 footwear factories located in 14 countries. We do not own or operate any of our own manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the products we sell. In fiscal 2014, five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of fiscal 2014 footwear production, and in aggregate accounted for approximately 67% of NIKE Brand footwear production in fiscal 2014. Our ability to meet our customers' needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers. If one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship, we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do not meet our quality standards, or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing, and financing. The principal materials used in our apparel products  natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat, or repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware  are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. The principal materials used in our footwear products  natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, nylon, leather, canvas, and polyurethane films  are also locally available to manufacturers. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate, train, and employ adequate personnel. NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured. There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. Further, our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future, unexpected increases in work wages, whether government mandated or otherwise. In addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, quality control standards, and labor, health, and safety standards. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in labor or wages, or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short- and long- term. Because independent manufacturers manufacture a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers, could adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air freight, which could adversely affect our profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins. In addition, Sojitz America performs significant import-export financing services for the Company. During fiscal 2014, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Brazil, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, South Africa, and Thailand (collectively the \"Sojitz Markets\"), excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the Sojitz Markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. Our success depends on our global distribution facilities. We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales, and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, particularly in emerging markets, depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities, and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities. We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy, or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. We are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party hosted services (information technology systems), across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations, and other business activities. Our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems. Over a number of years, we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Our work to integrate and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing. The failure of these systems to operate effectively or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. Furthermore, we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection and use for digital marketing, digital commerce, and the marketing and use of our Digital Sport products. We also engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors, and consumers. Our information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. The market for prime real estate is competitive. Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, both domestically and internationally, depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases. In addition, from time to time, we seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, or close some of our real estate locations, which may require modification of an existing lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, customers, and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our vendors and other suppliers, or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. From time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, new businesses, product offering and manufacturing innovation, and expansion of existing businesses, such as our retail operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost-effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. However, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business. The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources. From time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business. Our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business. Our future success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. The sale of a large number of shares held by our Chairman could depress the market price of our common stock. As of June 30, 2014, Philip H. Knight, Co-founder and Chairman of our Board of Directors, beneficially owned more than 75.1% of our Class A Common Stock. If on June 30, 2014 all of his Class A Common Stock were converted into Class B Common Stock, Mr. Knight would have owned more than 16.2% of our Class B Common Stock. These shares are available for resale, subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws. The sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options. Our long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by Standard  Poors and Moodys Investors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new initiatives. Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock. There are provisions of our articles of incorporation and Oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, a freeze-out statute, two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition, or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company. We may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline. Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts estimates of our future performance. Analysts estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. ", "2": " ITEM 2. Properties The following is a summary of principal properties owned or leased by NIKE. The NIKE World Campus, owned by NIKE and located near Beaverton, Oregon, USA, is a 270-acre facility of 38 buildings which, together with adjacent leased properties, functions as our world headquarters and is occupied by more than 8,500 e mployees engaged in management, research, design, development, marketing, finance, and other administrative functions serving nearly all of our divisions. We also lease various office facilities in the surrounding metropolitan area. We lease a similar, but smaller, administrative facility in Hilversum, the Netherlands, which serves as the headquarters for the Western Europe and Central  Eastern Europe geographies, and manages certain brand management functions for our non-U.S. operations. We also lease an office complex in Shanghai, China, our headquarters for Greater China, occupied by employees focused on implementing our wholesale, DTC and merchandising strategies in the region, among other functions.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations NIKE designs, develops, markets, and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, as well as through NIKE-owned in-line and factory retail stores and NIKE-owned internet websites (which we refer to as our Direct to Consumer or \"DTC\" operations), and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees, and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, must have products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands, and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online. In addition to achieving long-term, sustainable revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas: ##TABLE_START  Expanding gross margin by: ##TABLE_END - Delivering innovative, premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a strong consumer price-to-value proposition; - Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design, and innovation; and - Making our supply chain a competitive advantage. ##TABLE_START  Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of businesses to eliminate duplicative costs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Improving working capital efficiency; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Deploying capital effectively. ##TABLE_END Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals continue to be: ##TABLE_START  High single-digit revenue growth, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Mid-teens earnings per share growth, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consistent return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Steady results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. ##TABLE_END Over the past ten years, we have achieved many of these financial goals. During this time, revenues and diluted earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc., inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, have grown 9% and 13%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. Our return on invested capital has increased from 22% to 25% and we expanded gross margins by approximately 190 basis points. On November 15, 2012, we announced a two-for-one stock split of both Class A and Class B Common shares. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 24, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business December 10, 2012. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 26, 2012. All share numbers and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. Our fiscal 2014 results from continuing operations demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to deliver consistent growth in revenues, earnings, and cash returns to shareholders, while investing for long-term growth. Despite significant foreign currency headwinds, we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2014. Our revenues grew 10% to $27.8 billion, net income from continuing operations increased 10% to $2.7 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per common share of $2.97, an 11% increase from fiscal 2013. Earnings before interest and income taxes (\"EBIT\") from continuing operations increased 10% for fiscal 2014, driven by revenue growth and improved gross margin, which more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. The increase in revenues was driven by growth across nearly all NIKE  Brand geographies, key categories, and product types. This growth was primarily fueled by: ##TABLE_START  Innovative performance and sportswear products, incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE AIR, Lunar, Shox, Free, Flywire, Dri-Fit, FlyKnit, NIKE+, and NIKE Fuel; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Deep brand connections to consumers through a category lens, reinforced by investments in endorsements by high-profile athletes and teams, high-impact marketing around global sporting events (such as the World Cup, Olympics, and NFL Super Bowl) and digital marketing; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Strong category retail presentation online and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores. ##TABLE_END We also delivered strong results for Converse, with revenue and EBIT growth of 16% and 17%, respectively. Our gross margins improved largely due to the positive impact of higher average selling prices and contribution from our higher margin DTC business, partially offset by higher product input costs, due primarily to labor cost inflation in our product costs, and foreign currency headwinds. For fiscal 2014, the growth of our net income from continuing operations was positively affected by a year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate. In addition, diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 1% decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases. During the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we completed the sale of certain assets of the Umbro brand and recorded a loss on the sale of these assets of $107 million, net of tax. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we completed the sale of Cole Haan and recorded a gain on sale of $231 million, net of tax. As of May 31, 2013, the Company had substantially completed all transition services related to the sale of both businesses. Unless otherwise indicated, the following disclosures reflect the Company's continuing operations; refer to our Discontinued Operations\" section for additional information regarding our discontinued operations. While macroeconomic uncertainties in the global economy are likely to persist, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above. ##TABLE_START Results of Operations ##TABLE_END Unless otherwise indicated, the following disclosures reflect the Companys continuing operations. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data)  Fiscal 2014  Fiscal 2013 (1)  % Change  Fiscal 2012 (1)  % Change Revenues  $ 27,799  $ 25,313  %  $ 23,331  % Cost of sales  15,353  14,279  %  13,183  % Gross profit  12,446  11,034  %  10,148  % Gross margin %  44.8 %  43.6 %   43.5 %  Demand creation expense  3,031  2,745  %  2,607  % Operating overhead expense  5,735  5,051  %  4,472  % Total selling and administrative expense  8,766  7,796  %  7,079  % % of Revenues  31.5 %  30.8 %    30.3 %  Interest expense (income), net   (3 )      Other expense (income), net   (15 )      Income before income taxes  3,544  3,256  %  3,011  % Income tax expense    %   % Effective tax rate  24.0 %  24.7 %   25.0 %  Net income from continuing operations  2,693  2,451  %  2,257  % Net income (loss) from discontinued operations       (46 )   Net income  $ 2,693  $ 2,472  %  $ 2,211  % Diluted earnings per share - continuing operations  $ 2.97  $ 2.68  %  $ 2.40  % Diluted earnings per share - discontinued operations  $   $ 0.02    $ (0.05 )   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Prior year amounts have been revised to correctly expense internally developed patent and trademark costs as incurred.

Every NIKE Brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2014. North America contributed 5 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. revenues, while Western Europe and Emerging Markets each contributed 2 percentage points and Central  Eastern Europe and Converse each contributed 1 percentage point. On a currency neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 12% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 4% during fiscal 2014. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2014 was mainly due to growth in our Basketball, Sportswear, Running, and Football (Soccer) categories. The growth of NIKE footwear revenues continued to be fueled by increased demand for performance products, including NIKE and Brand Jordan Basketball styles; Running models with NIKE Free, Air Max, Lunar, and FlyKnit technologies; and performance Football (Soccer) products. Footwear unit sales in fiscal 2014 increased approximately 7% and the average selling price per pair increased approximately 5%, driven nearly equally by price increases and a shift in mix to higher priced products. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenues for fiscal 2014 was driven by growth in all key categories, most notably our Football (Soccer), Running, and Women's Training categories. In fiscal 2014, unit sales of apparel increased approximately 6% and the average selling price per unit increased approximately 4%, driven by price increases, and to a lesser extent, a shift in mix to higher priced products. While wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to expand our DTC businesses in each of our geographies. Our NIKE Brand DTC operations include NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through NIKE-owned websites. For fiscal 2014, DTC revenues represented approximately 20% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 18% in fiscal 2013. On a currency neutral basis, DTC revenues grew 22% for fiscal 2014, as comparable store sales grew 10% and we continued to open new stores and expand our e-commerce business. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year, and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Online sales through NIKE-owned websites, which are not included in comparable store sales, grew 42% in fiscal 2014. Online sales represented approximately 15% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2014, compared to 12% for fiscal 2013. On a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2014 NIKE Brand Men's revenues increased 9% mainly as a result of strong growth in our Basketball, Football (Soccer), Running, and Sportswear categories. Women's revenues increased 12% in large part due to increases in our Running, Sportswear, and Women's Training categories. The 16% increase in the Young Athletes' business was driven by increases in the Basketball and Football (Soccer) categories in part due to our expanded footwear and apparel offerings for this age group. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  On a currency neutral basis, revenues from our NIKE, Inc. continuing operations grew 11% for fiscal 2013, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and Converse. Every NIKE Brand geography except Greater China delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2013. North America contributed 7 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. revenues, while Emerging Markets contributed 2 percentage points and Western and Central  Eastern Europe each contributed 1 percentage point. Greater China ' s results reduced NIKE, Inc. revenue growth by 1 percentage point. Revenues for Converse contributed 1 percentage point to our consolidated revenue growth. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 11% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 17% during fiscal 2013. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2013 was attributable to growth across our Running, Basketball, Football (Soccer), and Sportswear categories. The growth of NIKE footwear revenues continued to be fueled by increased demand for performance products, including Running models with NIKE Free and Lunar technologies, NIKE and Brand Jordan Basketball styles, and performance Football (Soccer) products. In fiscal 2013, unit sales of footwear increased approximately 7% and the average selling price per pair increased approximately 4%, driven equally by price increases and a shift in mix to higher priced products. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenues for fiscal 2013 was driven by our Men ' s Training category (which includes the NFL licensed business), in addition to strong demand for Running and Basketball products. Apparel unit sales in fiscal 2013 increased approximately 7% and the average selling price per unit increased approximately 3%, reflecting a favorable mix of higher priced products, such as performance Running, Basketball, and NFL licensed apparel; and to a lesser extent, higher selling prices . For fiscal 2013, DTC channels represented approximately 18% of overall NIKE Brand revenues compared to 16% in fiscal 2012. On a currency neutral basis, DTC revenues grew 24% for fiscal 2013, as comparable store sales grew 14% and we continued to expand our store network and e-commerce businesses. Online sales through NIKE-owned websites grew 32% in fiscal 2013 and represented approximately 12% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2013. On a wholesale equivalent and currency neutral basis, fiscal 2013 NIKE Brand Men's revenues increased 9% due primarily to growth in our Running, Men's Training, and Basketball categories. Women's revenues increased 9% driven primarily by an increase in Running and Women's Training. The 11% increase in the Young Athletes' business was due primarily to increases in Basketball. Futures Orders Futures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2014 were 11% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. The U.S.  Dollar futures order amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period.  Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders increased 12%, with unit orders and average selling price per unit contributing approximately 8 and 4 percentage points of growth, respectively. By geography, futures orders growth was as follows:  ##TABLE_START   Reported Futures Orders Growth  Futures Orders Excluding Currency Changes (1) North America  %  % Western Europe  %  % Central  Eastern Europe  %  % Greater China  %  % Japan  %  % Emerging Markets  %  % Total NIKE Brand futures orders  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Growth rates have been restated using constant exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. ##TABLE_END The reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and at-once orders, and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts, and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales of at-once and closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, NIKE Brand equipment, DTC operation sales, and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf, and Hurley. Gross Margin ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions)  Fiscal 2014  Fiscal 2013  % Change  Fiscal 2012  % Change  Gross profit  $ 12,446  $ 11,034  %  $ 10,148  %  Gross margin %  44.8 %  43.6 %  bps  43.5 %  bps  ##TABLE_ENDFiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  For fiscal 2014, our consolidated gross margin was 120 basis points higher than fiscal 2013, primarily driven by higher NIKE Brand average selling prices (increasing gross margin approximately 160 basis points), attributable to both price increases and a shift in mix to higher priced products. Gross margin was also positively impacted by growth in our higher margin DTC business (increasing gross margin approximately 40 basis points) and improved margins due to cleaner closeout inventories (increasing margin approximately 20 basis points). These increases in gross margin were partially offset by higher product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 50 basis points), primarily due to a shift in mix to higher cost products, as well as product labor input cost inflation. Gross margins were also negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements (decreasing gross margin approximately 50 basis points). Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  For fiscal 2013, our consolidated gross margin was 10 basis points higher than fiscal 2012, primarily driven by higher average selling prices (approximately 160 basis points) that were attributable to higher prices and a favorable sales mix. The positive benefit of higher net average selling prices was largely offset by higher product costs (approximately 110 basis points), primarily due to higher factory labor costs, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements (approximately 40 basis points). In addition, in fiscal 2013 we experienced significant shifts in the mix of revenues from higher to lower margin segments of our business. While growth in these lower gross margin segments delivered incremental revenue and profits, it had a negative effect on our consolidated gross margin.

Refer to Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  Demand creation expense increased 10% compared to the prior year, mainly driven by marketing support for events, including the World Cup, higher sports marketing expense, key product launches and initiatives, and investments to upgrade the presentation of our products in wholesale accounts. For fiscal 2014, changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on Demand creation expense. Compared to the prior year, Operating overhead expense increased 14%, primarily attributable to growth in our DTC business driven by new store openings, higher personnel costs, and e-commerce launches, as well as increased investments in our digital capabilities and corporate infrastructure. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on Operating overhead expense for fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  Demand creation expense increased 5% compared to the prior year, mainly driven by an increase in sports marketing expense, marketing support for key product initiatives, including the NIKE FuelBand and NFL launch, as well as an increased level of marketing spending around global sporting events such as the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, Demand creation expense increased 8%. Compared to the prior year, Operating overhead expense increased 13%, primarily attributable to increased investments in our DTC operations, higher personnel costs, and corporate initiatives to support the growth of our overall business. Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the growth in Operating overhead expense was 15%. Other Expense (Income), Net ##TABLE_START (In millions)  Fiscal 2014  Fiscal 2013  Fiscal 2012 Other expense (income), net  $  $ (15 )  $ ##TABLE_ENDOther expense (income), net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  Other expense (income), net shifted from $15 million of other (income), net for fiscal 2013 to $103 million of other expense, net, for fiscal 2014, primarily driven by a $90 million adverse change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses as well as an adverse legal judgment in the second quarter of the current year related to a long outstanding bankruptcy case for a former customer in Western Europe. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $139 million for fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  Other expense (income), net shifted from $54 million of other expense, net for fiscal 2012 to $15 million of other (income) net, for fiscal 2013. This change was primarily driven by a $48 million decrease in foreign currency net losses as well as the recognition of a $24 million restructuring charge for NIKE Brand ' s Western Europe operations in fiscal 2012. These positive impacts were partially offset by smaller net gains from non-operating items. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $56 million for fiscal 2013.

During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014, we reached a resolution with the IRS on an Advanced Pricing Agreement. This agreement did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014. Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  The 30 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily driven by the U.S. legislative retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit and a reduction of tax reserves on foreign operations, partially offset by an increase in the percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Discontinued Operations During fiscal 2013, we divested of Umbro and Cole Haan, allowing us to focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse, and Hurley brands. The results of the divestiture are presented as discontinued operations. Please refer to Note 15  Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. ##TABLE_START Operating Segments ##TABLE_ENDOur reportable operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization, which changed beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The NIKE Brand segments continue to be defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity, which now includes the results of NIKE Golf and Hurley. Previously, NIKE Golf and Hurley were combined with Converse and reported as \"Other Businesses.\" Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing, and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. The Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. The Companys NIKE Brand DTC operations are managed within each geographic segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for NIKE, Inc., and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing, and selling of casual sneakers, apparel, and accessories. Prior year amounts have been restated to conform to fiscal 2014 presentation. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine months in advance of the future selling season based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program.

Our Basketball, Men's Training, Running, and Sportswear categories fueled the revenue growth in fiscal 2014. DTC revenue growth in North America for fiscal 2014 was driven by a 7% increase in comparable store sales, the addition of 16 net new stores, and strong online sales growth. Footwear revenues growth in North America was driven by higher demand in nearly all key categories, led by our Basketball, Running, and Sportswear categories. For fiscal 2014, unit sales increased 7% and average selling price per pair increased 4%. The increase in average selling price per pair was driven by price increases and shift in mix toward higher priced products in nearly equal amounts. North America apparel revenues growth was fueled by higher demand in all key categories, most notably our Men ' s Training, Women's Training, and Sportswear categories. Both unit sales and average selling price per unit increased, with unit sales increasing 6% and average selling price per unit increasing 4%. The increase in average selling price per unit was primarily driven by price increases, and to a lesser extent, a change in mix to higher priced products. North America EBIT increased at a faster rate than revenues due to gross margin expansion and slight selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 120 basis points for fiscal 2014, reflecting pricing initiatives as well as lower product costs as a result of favorable changes in product mix. These gross margin benefits were partially offset by higher off-price mix. Selling and administrative expenses grew in line with revenues as a result of higher operating overhead costs to support DTC growth and higher demand creation expense in support of the World Cup and key product and brand initiatives. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  Our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections, and compelling retail experiences to consumers in North America, driving increased demand for NIKE Brand products across all key categories except Action Sports. Our Basketball, Men's Training, Running, and Sportswear categories drove the revenue growth in fiscal 2013. North America ' s DTC revenue growth for fiscal 2013 was fueled by 15% growth in comparable store sales as well as the addition of new stores and rapid growth in online sales. North America footwear revenues growth was driven by higher demand in all key categories, most notably Basketball, Running, and Sportswear. Both unit sales and average selling price per pair increased 7% in fiscal 2013. The increase in average selling price per pair was driven approximately equally by price increases and a favorable mix of higher priced products. Apparel revenues growth in North America was driven by higher demand in our Men ' s Training category, reflecting the addition of the NFL licensed business, as well as Basketball, Women ' s Training, and Running. Unit sales increased 9% while average selling price per unit increased 11%, largely driven by a favorable mix of higher priced products. North America EBIT increased faster than revenues due to gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 50 basis points for fiscal 2013, reflecting the favorable impact of selling price increases, partially offset by higher product costs, an unfavorable mix of lower margin products, and royalties for the NFL business. Selling and administrative expenses increased versus fiscal 2012, though at a rate slower than revenues; the growth was largely driven by higher demand creation expense for the Olympics in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 as well as key product initiatives, including the NFL launch, and higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion of our DTC business and overall growth of the business.

On a currency neutral basis, all territories in Western Europe reported revenue growth for fiscal 2014, except Italy and Iberia, which declined 7% and 1%, respectively. Revenues for the U.K.   Ireland and AGS (Austria, Germany, and Switzerland), our largest territories in Western Europe, increased 20% and 23%, respectively. On a category basis, revenue growth in fiscal 2014 was fueled by our Running, Football (Soccer), and Sportswear categories. The growth in DTC revenues for fiscal 2014 was driven by 17% growth in comparable store sales, rapid growth in online sales, and the addition of 19 net new stores. Constant currency footwear revenues growth in Western Europe reflected increases in every key category, most notably our Sportswear, Running, Football (Soccer), and Basketball categories. Unit sales in fiscal 2014 increased 11% and average selling price per pair increased 9%. The increase in average price per pair was primarily the result of price increases, a shift in mix to higher priced products, and lower discounts. The constant currency increase in Western Europe apparel revenues was due to increases in Football (Soccer), Running, and Women's Training, partially offset by a decline in Sportswear. Unit sales increased 3% while average selling price per unit increased 4%, driven primarily by lower discounts on off-price closeout sales compared to the prior year. On a reported basis, Western Europe EBIT for fiscal 2014 grew at a faster rate than revenues as a result of a 150 basis point increase in gross margin and selling and administrative expense leverage. The gross margin increase was fueled by higher average selling prices, growth in our higher margin DTC business, lower discounts, and lower off-price mix, which more than offset unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product input costs. Selling and administrative expense was lower as a percentage of revenue despite higher operating overhead costs to support growth in our DTC business and higher demand creation spending for sports marketing to support key events such as the World Cup. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  On a currency neutral basis, most territories in Western Europe reported revenue growth for fiscal 2013, which more than offset revenues declines of 17% and 18% in Italy and Iberia, respectively, reflecting poor economic conditions in southern Europe. Revenues for the U.K.   Ireland and AGS territories increased 8% and 12%, respectively. The growth in DTC revenues reflected 17% growth in comparable store sales, the addition of 19 net new stores and strong growth in online sales. On a category basis, Western Europe ' s revenues growth was largely driven by growth in our Running and Basketball categories. Constant currency footwear revenues growth in Western Europe was primarily driven by growth in Running, Sportswear, and Basketball. Unit sales increased 7% and average selling price per pair increased 3%, the latter primarily the result of price increases. The constant currency decrease in Western Europe apparel revenues was due to a decline in Sportswear, partially offset by growth in Running, Men ' s Training, and Basketball. Unit sales in fiscal 2013 decreased 1% while average selling price per unit decreased 3%, as higher discounts on closeout sales more than offset selling price increases. The EBIT growth in fiscal 2013 was driven by a 200 basis point increase in gross margin, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. The gross margin increase was primarily driven by favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates; higher net average selling prices were mostly offset by higher product costs. The increase in selling and administrative expense was mainly driven by an increased level of demand creation spending around the European Football Championships and Olympics in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, as well as higher sports marketing expense. Additionally, operating overhead costs increased to support the expansion of our DTC business and overall growth of the business. Fiscal 2013 EBIT growth for Western Europe was also increased by a $24 million, one-time restructuring charge that was recorded in Other expense (income), net, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.

Revenues growth in Central  Eastern Europe was driven by growth in nearly every key category, led by Football (Soccer) and Running. Constant currency footwear revenues growth in fiscal 2014 was driven by growth in nearly all categories, most notably Running and Football (Soccer). Unit sales increased 11% while average selling price per pair increased 4%, due primarily to price increases. Constant currency apparel revenues growth in fiscal 2014 was driven by growth in every key category, led by Football (Soccer) and Running. Unit sales increased 15%, while average selling price per unit increased 2%, driven by price increases. On a reported basis, EBIT for Central   Eastern Europe grew faster than revenues primarily due to gross margin improvement, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased 180 basis points, primarily driven by price increases, a shift in mix to higher margin products, warehousing efficiencies, and the favorable impact of our higher margin DTC business, partially offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased as a result of higher demand creation expense to support key events as well as higher operating overhead to support overall growth, including our expanding DTC business. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  On a currency neutral basis, Central   Eastern Europe revenues for fiscal 2013 was driven by growth across most territories, particularly Russia and Turkey, which grew 28% and 19%, respectively. Revenues growth in Central  Eastern Europe was driven by growth in all key categories, most notably Running, Football (Soccer), and Sportswear. Constant currency footwear revenues growth in fiscal 2013 was primarily driven by growth in Running, Football (Soccer), and Basketball, partially offset by lower revenues in Sportswear. Unit sales increased 6% while average selling price per pair increased 5%, primarily driven by price increases. Constant currency apparel revenues growth in fiscal 2013 was driven by growth in nearly all categories, most notably Sportswear, Football (Soccer), and Running. Unit sales increased 16%, while average selling price per unit decreased 2%, as an unfavorable mix of lower priced products more than offset higher selling prices. EBIT for Central   Eastern Europe grew faster than revenues primarily due to gross margin improvement and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 30 basis points, largely driven by price increases and the favorable impact of our higher margin DTC business, more than offsetting higher product costs and unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates.

The growth in DTC revenues reflected a 20% increase in comparable store sales, the addition of 30 net new stores, as well as online sales growth. The increase in DTC revenues more than offset a 4% decrease in sales in our wholesale business as we continued to manage the amount of product sold into the market and worked with our wholesale partners to optimize product mix for the consumer. On a category basis, higher revenues in our Basketball, Sportswear, and Running categories more than offset declines in Men's Training, Action Sports, and Women's Training. Constant currency footwear revenues growth for Greater China in fiscal 2014 was driven by increased sales in our Basketball and Sportswear categories, partially offset by declines in our Men's Training, Running, and Action Sports categories. Unit sales for fiscal 2014 were flat compared to the prior year while average selling price per pair increased 5%, driven by favorable revenue mix resulting from a higher percentage of sales from our higher price DTC business, as well as a shift in mix to higher priced product. Constant currency apparel revenues growth for fiscal 2014 was driven by increases in the Running, Sportswear, and Basketball categories, partially offset by decreases in Men's Training and Women's Training. Apparel unit sales in fiscal 2014 were 1% higher while average selling price per unit was flat. Fiscal 2014 reported EBIT for Greater China was flat compared to the prior year as reported revenue and gross margin increases were offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales. Gross margin increased150 basis points as higher average selling prices, growth in our higher margin DTC business, and improved margins on closeout sales more than offset higher product input costs and unfavorable product mix. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs driven by increased investments to support DTC growth and our new Greater China headquarters in Shanghai, as well as higher demand creation spending. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  On a currency neutral basis, Greater China revenues decreased in fiscal 2013, driven by lower futures orders as well as increased discounts, product returns and proactive cancellation of orders to manage inventory levels at retail. These downsides were partially offset by 33% growth in our DTC business driven by comparable store sales growth of 13% and the addition of 29 net new stores. Fiscal 2013 revenues for most key categories were lower than in fiscal 2012. For fiscal 2013, constant currency footwear revenues for Greater China declined, driven by lower sales across most key categories, most notably Sportswear, Men ' s Training, and Women ' s Training; and increased reserves for product discounts and returns. Unit sales decreased 1%, while average selling price per pair decreased 2%, reflecting a higher mix of closeout sales and higher discounts. The decrease in constant currency apparel revenues for fiscal 2013 was driven by lower revenues in Sportswear, Men ' s Training, and Women ' s Training, partially offset by higher revenues in Basketball. Apparel unit sales in fiscal 2013 were 3% lower than the prior year while average selling price per unit was down 5%, reflecting a higher mix of closeout sales and higher discounts. Fiscal 2013 EBIT for Greater China decreased at a faster rate than revenues, driven by lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense. Fiscal 2013 gross margin decreased 50 basis points due to a lower average selling price per unit driven by higher discounts and closeout mix partially offset by favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased as a percent of revenues, driven primarily by the increased investment in our DTC business and the decrease in revenues.

Fiscal 2014 EBIT for Japan decreased 6% as a 12% decline in reported revenues, due to the weaker Yen, was only partially offset by higher gross margin and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 20 basis points as higher average selling prices, favorable off-price mix, and the favorable impact of higher margin DTC revenues were mostly offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in selling and administrative expense in fiscal 2014 was attributable to lower operating overhead and demand creation spending. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, the revenues increase for Japan was driven by higher revenues in Running, Football (Soccer), and Basketball, partially offset by lower revenues in Sportswear, Men ' s Training, and Women ' s Training. Fiscal 2013 EBIT for Japan increased as lower reported revenues were more than offset by gross margin improvement and lower selling and administrative expense. The decrease in selling and administrative expense in fiscal 2013 was attributable to both lower operating overhead and demand creation spending.

Our largest territory, Brazil, grew 19%, while our SOCO territory (which includes Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile) grew 25%. Mexico revenues decreased 3% as a result of shipping delays caused by issues with a distribution center transition in the first half of fiscal 2014. On a category basis, revenues were higher in nearly every category, led by Football (Soccer), Running, and Sportswear. Constant currency footwear revenues growth for fiscal 2014 was driven by growth in nearly every key category, led by Running, Sportswear, Football (Soccer), and Action Sports. Unit sales for fiscal 2014 increased 4% and average selling price per pair increased 6%, primarily driven by price increases, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain Latin American territories, and to a lesser extent, a shift in mix to higher priced product. Constant currency apparel revenues increased driven by growth in every key category, most notably Football (Soccer) and Running. Unit sales increased 11% and average selling price per unit increased 10%, primarily due to price increases, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain Latin American territories. Fiscal 2014 reported EBIT for Emerging Markets decreased primarily due to a decline in gross margin, higher selling and administrative expense, and weaker currencies in a number of developing markets. Gross margin decreased 30 basis points due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, higher product costs, higher warehousing costs related to distribution center transition challenges in Mexico, and higher discounts, which more than offset higher average selling prices and a favorable shift to higher priced products. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion of our DTC business and infrastructure investments to support growth, as well as increases in demand creation spending to support the World Cup and key product launches. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  For fiscal 2013, constant currency revenues growth for the Emerging Markets geography was driven by growth in every key category and territory, led by SOCO, Brazil, and Mexico. Constant currency footwear revenues growth for fiscal 2013 was driven by growth in most key categories, most notably Running, Football (Soccer), and Women ' s Training. Unit sales increased approximately 9% and average selling price per pair increased 6%, primarily driven by selling price increases. Fiscal 2013 constant currency apparel revenues were driven by growth in every key category, led by Football (Soccer), Running, Sportswear, and Men ' s Training. Unit sales increased approximately 10% and average selling price per unit increased 9%, largely attributable to price increases. Fiscal 2013 Emerging Markets EBIT grew faster than revenue primarily driven by gross margin improvement, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue. Gross margin increased 260 basis points due largely to the favorable impact of price increases, the anniversary of a one-time customs duty charge in fiscal 2012, and favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, which more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher product costs. As a percent of revenue, selling and administrative expense was higher due to higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion of our DTC business and overall growth of the business.

The largest direct distribution markets are the United States, the United Kingdom, and China. Converse does not own the Converse trademarks in Japan. Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalty revenues to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Converse increased 15% for fiscal 2014. Revenue growth in direct distribution markets, which represent approximately 84% of Converse revenues, contributed 16 percentage points to the total increase for fiscal 2014, while licensing revenues decreased overall revenue by 1 percentage point. Revenues from our direct distribution markets grew 19% for fiscal 2014 driven by growth in \"comparable\" direct distribution markets (i.e., markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years), primarily the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. Comparable direct distribution markets revenues increased 13%, contributing 12 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenues growth for fiscal 2014, while conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution contributed 7 percentage points. Comparable direct distribution markets unit sales increased 12% and average selling price per unit increased 1% for fiscal 2014. The increase in average selling price per unit resulted primarily from a favorable mix of higher priced product. Due to market conversions and business declines in Latin America, licensing revenues decreased 3% for fiscal 2014. On a reported basis, EBIT at Converse grew 17% for fiscal 2014 as higher revenues and gross margin were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased 80 basis points, primarily due to growth in higher margin territories and products within our direct distribution markets. Selling and administrative expense grew faster than revenue for fiscal 2014 due to higher operating overhead to support growth initiatives and DTC expansion, as well as higher demand creation spending. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  Constant currency revenues for Converse increased 10% for fiscal 2013. Revenue growth in direct distribution markets, which represented approximately 81% of Converse revenues, contributed 11 percentage points to the total increase for fiscal 2013, while licensing revenues decreased overall revenue growth by 1 percentage point. Revenues from our direct distribution markets grew 15% for fiscal 2013 driven by growth in comparable direct distribution markets, primarily the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. Comparable direct distribution markets revenues increased 11%, contributing 10 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenues growth for fiscal 2013; conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution contributed 5 percentage points. Comparable direct distribution markets unit sales increased 6% and average selling price per unit increased 5% for fiscal 2013. The increase in average selling price per unit resulted primarily from a higher mix of higher priced product. Due to market conversions and business declines in Latin America, licensing revenues decreased 7% for fiscal 2013. On a reported basis, EBIT for Converse grew 8% for fiscal 2013 as higher revenues and gross margin were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased 120 basis points, primarily due to growth in higher margin territories and products within our direct distribution markets.

The Corporate loss before interest and taxes consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit, and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses. In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results included in gross margin are gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency hedge results. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  For fiscal 2014, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased by $125 million primarily due to the following: ##TABLE_START  a $99 million increase in corporate overhead expense related to corporate initiatives to support the growth of the business as well as performance-based compensation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $90 million increase in foreign currency net losses, reported as a component of Other expense (income), net; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $56 million decrease in foreign exchange losses related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains; these losses are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin. ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012  For fiscal 2013, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased by $210 million primarily due to the following: ##TABLE_START  a $165 million increase in foreign exchange losses related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains; these losses are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  an $86 million increase in corporate overhead expense related to corporate initiatives to support the growth of the business and performance-based compensation; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $48 million decrease in foreign currency net losses, reported as a component of Other expense (income), net. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices ##TABLE_ENDOverview As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows into U.S. Dollars. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (\"NTC\") and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Transactional exposures We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: ##TABLE_START  Product Costs  NIKEs product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START a. Some NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. ##TABLE_END In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost. ##TABLE_START 2. Factory input costs: In January 2012, NIKE implemented a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. ##TABLE_END For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other expense (income), net . Refer to Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKEs U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost. ##TABLE_START  Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales  A portion of our Western Europe and Central  Eastern Europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Costs  Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, intercompany royalties and other intercompany charges, also generate foreign currency risk though to a lesser extent. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities  Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, which may create fluctuations in Other expense (income), net within our consolidated results of operations. ##TABLE_END Managing transactional exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost purchase exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales, and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in Other expense (income), net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements and Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end. Translational exposures Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results, and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $288 million and $605 million for the years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $49 million and $104 million for the years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Managing translational exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements and Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end. We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $139 million and $56 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net investments in foreign subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of Other expense (income), net . The impact of ineffective hedges was immaterial for any period presented. To minimize credit risk, we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration. Upon maturity, the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in Other comprehensive income. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2014 and 2013. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013. ##TABLE_START Liquidity and Capital Resources ##TABLE_ENDCash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $3,003 million for fiscal 2014 compared to $2,968 million for fiscal 2013 . Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2014 was net income of $2,693 million . Our fiscal 2014 change in working capital was a net cash outflow of $488 million as compared to a net cash outflow of $78 million for fiscal 2013 . Our investments in working capital increased due to higher inventory levels to support higher reported futures orders, growth in accounts receivable reflecting the increase in sales, and higher prepaid marketing expenses in advance of the World Cup. These increases in working capital were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Cash used by investing activities was $1,207 million during fiscal 2014 , compared to a $940 million use of cash for fiscal 2013 . A major driver of the change was a $282 million increase in additions to property, plant and equipment from $598 million in fiscal 2013 to $880 million in fiscal 2014, reflective of investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth, as well as digital capabilities. In fiscal 2014, we made $328 million in net purchases of short-term investments (net of sales/maturities) compared to $1,140 million in net purchases (net of sales/maturities) in fiscal 2013. Cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2013 was partially offset by $786 million in proceeds from the sale of Umbro and Cole Haan. Cash used by financing activities was $2,914 million for fiscal 2014 compared to $1,045 million for fiscal 2013 , an increase of $1,869 million. The increase was primarily due to a $954 million increase in share repurchases to $2,628 million, a $ 986 million decrease in net proceeds from long term debt issuance (reflecting the issuance of 10- and 30-year notes in April 2013), and a $96 million increase in dividends, partially offset by a year-on-year increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. In fiscal 2014 , we purchased 36.6 million shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock for $2,628 million , an average price of $ 71.80 . During fiscal 2013, we completed the four-year, $5 billion share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2008. Under that program, we purchased a total of 118.8 million shares at an average price of $42.08. Subsequently, we began repurchases under a four-year, $8 billion program approved by the Board in September 2012. As of the end of fiscal 2014 , we had repurchased 51.9 million shares at an average price of $65.83 for a total cost of $3,417 million under this current program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Capital Resources On April 23, 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement (the \"Shelf\") with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities. The Shelf expires on April 23, 2016. On April 23, 2013, we issued $1.0 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043. The 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 2.25% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2023. The 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.625% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2043. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of $998 million. On November 1, 2011, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with lender approval. Following an extension agreement on September 17, 2013 between the Company and the syndicate of banks, the facility matures November 1, 2017, with a one-year extension option exercisable through October 31, 2014. No amounts were outstanding under this facility as of May 31, 2014 or 2013 . We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2014 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. During the year ended May 31, 2014 , we did not issue commercial paper, and as of May 31, 2014 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this program. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2015 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. As of May 31, 2014 , we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling $5.1 billion , of which $2.5 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2014 the average duration of our short-term investments and cash equivalents portfolio was 126 days. To date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the United States through debt, we would incur additional interest expense . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2014 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: ##TABLE_START Description of Commitment  Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, (In millions)       Thereafter  Total Operating Leases  $  $  $  $  $  $ 1,050  $ 2,804 Capital Leases         Long-term Debt (1)       1,488  1,851 Endorsement Contracts (2)       1,381  4,704 Product Purchase Obligations (3)  3,688            3,688 Other (4)        TOTAL  $ 5,497  $ 1,474  $ 1,196  $  $  $ 3,931  $ 13,638 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2014 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments, and the term of the debt obligations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. ##TABLE_END In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. ##TABLE_START (3) We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2014 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in Accounts payable or Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2014 . ##TABLE_END The total liability for uncertain tax positions was $506 million , excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2014 . We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2014 . Refer to Note 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. ##TABLE_START (In millions) Outstanding as of May 31, 2014 Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand $ Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2014 , letters of credit of $135 million were outstanding, which were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Companys performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. ##TABLE_START Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ##TABLE_ENDIn July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued an accounting standards update intended to provide guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits, reflecting the manner in which an entity would settle, at the reporting date, any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position when net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, or tax credit carryforwards exist. This accounting standard is effective for us beginning June 1, 2014 and early adoption is permitted. We early adopted this guidance and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In July 2012, the FASB issued an accounting standards update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. This accounting standard update was effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entitys right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. This new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements. This new guidance was effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. ##TABLE_START Recently Issued Accounting Standards ##TABLE_ENDIn May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. Among other things, the updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. ##TABLE_START Critical Accounting Policies ##TABLE_ENDOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the United States, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts, and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers, and estimated returns, discounts, and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts, and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts, and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to Cost of sales.  Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in Demand creation expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance, increased or decreased Demand creation expense may be reported in a future period. Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the assets net book value to its salvage value. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets  We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. We may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any. We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk, and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate, and the weighted average cost of capital. Fair Value Measurements For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, including U.S. Treasury securities. In the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as commercial paper and bonds, U.S. Agency securities, and money market funds. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our available-for-sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, and credit risks. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include an analysis of period-over-period fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Other comprehensive income, rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Other comprehensive income into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of forward and option contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Other comprehensive income to Other expense (income), net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. We have used and may in the future use, forward contracts or options to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the forward contracts or options hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income within Total shareholders equity, to the extent effective, to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported as Other expense (income), net during the period in which changes occur. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Income Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, thus reducing our overall Income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional Income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our Income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues, and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as Other expense (income), net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding, or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing, and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, and may in the future, also use forward contracts or options to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. See section Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices under Item 7 for additional detail. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixed rate debt. ##TABLE_START Market Risk Measurement ##TABLE_ENDWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk (VaR). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing, and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $50 million and $34 million at May 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-year as a result of an increase in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio combined with a longer average duration on our outstanding trades at May 31, 2014. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $70 million and $49 million during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt, and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows. Details of third-party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates at May 31, 2014. ##TABLE_START   Expected Maturity Date Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions)       Thereafter  Total  Fair Value Foreign Exchange Risk                 Japanese Yen Functional Currency                 Long-term Japanese Yen debt  Fixed rate                 Principal payments  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $ Average interest rate  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %   Interest Rate Risk                 Japanese Yen Functional Currency                 Long-term Japanese Yen debt  Fixed rate                 Principal payments  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $ Average interest rate  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %   U.S. Dollar Functional Currency                 Long-term U.S. Dollar debt  Fixed rate swapped to Floating rate                 Principal payments  $   $  $   $   $   $   $  $ Average interest rate  0.0 %  0.3 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.3 %   Long-term U.S. Dollar debt  Fixed rate                 Principal payments  $  $  $  $  $   $ 1,000  $ 1,058  $ 1,003 Average interest rate  6.4 %  6.4 %  6.2 %  6.8 %   %  2.9 %  3.1 %   ##TABLE_ENDThe fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries.

The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles we considered appropriate in the circumstances and include some amounts based on our best estimates and judgments. Other financial information in this report is consistent with these financial statements. Our accounting systems include controls designed to reasonably assure assets are safeguarded from unauthorized use or disposition and provide for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These systems are supplemented by the selection and training of qualified financial personnel and an organizational structure providing for appropriate segregation of duties. An internal Corporate Audit department reviews the results of its work with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, presently consisting of four outside directors. The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews with the independent registered public accounting firm, management, and the internal audit staff, the scope and the results of the annual examination, the effectiveness of the accounting control system, and other matters relating to the financial affairs of NIKE as the Audit Committee deems appropriate. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have full access to the Committee, with and without the presence of management, to discuss any appropriate matters. ##TABLE_START Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting ##TABLE_ENDManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(f) and Rule 15(d) - 15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect on the financial statements. While reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, it does not mean absolute assurance. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatement and instance of fraud. Controls are susceptible to manipulation, especially in instances of fraud caused by the collusion of two or more people, including our senior management. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework  (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2014 . PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited (1) the Consolidated Financial Statements and (2) the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2014 , as stated in their report herein. ##TABLE_START Mark G. Parker Donald W. Blair President and Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ##TABLE_ENDTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NIKE, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries at May 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework  (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /S/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP Portland, Oregon July 25, 2014   ##TABLE_START NIKE, Inc.

Wholly-owned NIKE, Inc. subsidiaries include Converse Inc., which designs, markets and distributes casual sneakers, apparel and accessories and Hurley International LLC, which designs, markets and distributes action sports and youth lifestyle footwear, apparel and accessories. Basis of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company completed the sale of Cole Haan during the third quarter ended February 28, 2013 and completed the sale of Umbro during the second quarter ended November 30, 2012. As a result, the Company reports the operating results of Cole Haan and Umbro in the Net income (loss) from discontinued operations line in the Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. In addition, the liabilities associated with these businesses are reported as Liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (refer to Note 15  Discontinued Operations). Unless otherwise indicated, the disclosures accompanying the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the Companys continuing operations. On November 15, 2012, the Company announced a two -for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common shares. The stock split was a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 24, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business December 10, 2012. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 26, 2012. All share numbers and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2014 presentation. Revisions The Company has historically capitalized costs associated with internally generated patents and trademarks, and amortized these assets over the legal term of the patents and trademarks. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 , management determined that these capitalized costs were not accurately identified with specific patent or trademark assets, and therefore, concluded that amounts previously capitalized should have been expensed as incurred. Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial Statements have been revised to correctly expense costs associated with internally developed patents and trademarks in the period incurred and to reverse expenses for amortization of previously capitalized costs. The revisions resulted in a decrease in Net income from continuing operations of $13 million and $12 million for the years ended May 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Identifiable intangible assets decreased $93 million at May 31, 2013 and Retained earnings at May 31, 2013 decreased $75 million as a result of the cumulative adjustment for prior periods. Cash provided by operations decreased $26 million and $23 million for the years ended May 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, while Cash used by investing activities decreased $26 million for the year ended May 31, 2013 and Cash provided by investing activities increased by $23 million for the year ended May 31, 2012 . Also, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 , the Company revised certain prior year amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to eliminate intercompany transfers of short-term investments, to correctly reflect the purchases, sales and maturities of short-term investments related to the Company's hedging program involving U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale securities, and to correctly classify certain investment holdings as Short-term investments. For the year ended May 31, 2013 , the revisions resulted in a net increase in Purchases of short-term investments of $431 million , a net increase in Maturities of short-term investments of $162 million , and a net increase in Sales of short-term investments of $332 million , which caused a net decrease of $63 million in Cash used by investing activities. For the year ended May 31, 2012 , the revisions resulted in a net increase in Purchases of short-term investments of $540 million , a net increase in Maturities of short-term investments of $78 million , and a net increase in Sales of short-term investments of $477 million , which caused an increase of $15 million in Cash provided by investing activities. For the year ended May 31, 2012 , these revisions also resulted in a decrease of $78 million in Cash and equivalents, beginning of year and a $63 million decrease in Cash and equivalents, end of year. Certain prior year amounts have also been revised in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to correctly recognize certain inventory amounts held by third parties, which were identified during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and resulted in a $50 million increase to both Inventories and Accrued liabilities at May 31, 2013 . In addition, prior year amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows were revised to correctly reflect the related cash flow impacts of $22 million and $10 million for the years ended May 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. This revision had no impact on Cash provided by operations or Net (decrease) increase in cash and equivalents, for any year. The Company also revised certain prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to correctly reflect non-cash additions to property, plant, and equipment, which were identified during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 . For the year ended May 31, 2013 , this revision decreased Cash provided by operations and decreased Cash used by investing activities, each by $38 million . For the year ended May 31, 2012 , this revision decreased Cash provided by operations and increased Cash provided by investing activities, each by $34 million . The Company assessed the materiality of these misstatements on prior periods financial statements in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (\"SAB\") No. 99, Materiality, codified in ASC 250 (\"ASC 250\"), Presentation of Financial Statements, and concluded that these misstatements were not material to any prior annual or interim periods. Accordingly, in accordance with ASC 250 (SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements), the Consolidated Financial Statements as of May 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the years then ended, which are presented herein, have been revised.

This occurs upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims from customers are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale. Post-invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. Estimates of discretionary discounts, returns and claims are based on historical rates, specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers, and estimated discounts, returns and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers. As of May 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Companys reserve balances for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims were $610 million and $531 million , respectively. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses, and research, design and development costs. Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales. Operating Overhead Expense Operating overhead expense consists primarily of payroll and benefit related costs, rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services, and meetings and travel. Demand Creation Expense Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, television, digital and print advertising, brand events, and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run. Advertising placement costs are expensed in the month the advertising appears, while costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is completed and delivered. A significant amount of the Companys promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. Accounting for endorsement payments is based upon specific contract provisions. Generally, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract after giving recognition to periodic performance compliance provisions of the contracts. Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). The Company records Demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are recorded in Demand creation expense when the Company determines that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from the Company's estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance, increased or decreased Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. The Company expenses these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, the Company offers minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which the Company estimates it will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, the Company records the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Through cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses retail customers for certain costs of advertising the Companys products. The Company records these costs in Demand creation expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs, which is when the related revenues are recognized. This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run. Total advertising and promotion expenses were $3,031 million , $2,745 million , and $2,607 million for the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses totaled $516 million and $386 million at May 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and were recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, and corporate debt securities with maturities of three months or less at date of purchase. Short-Term Investments Short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, and corporate debt securities, with maturities over three months from the date of purchase. Debt securities that the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At May 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company did not hold any short-term investments that were classified as trading or held-to-maturity. At May 31, 2014 and 2013 , Short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Other comprehensive income, unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond three months at the date of purchase as current assets within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Companys short-term investments. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts receivable from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $78 million and $104 million at May 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, of which $37 million and $54 million , respectively, was classified as long-term and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and valued on either an average or specific identification cost basis. For inventories in transit that represent direct shipments to customers, the related inventory and cost of sales is recognized on a specific identification basis. Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Company's suppliers, as well as freight, import duties, taxes, insurance and logistics and other handling fees. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years. Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales. Depreciation and amortization of other assets are recorded in Total selling and administrative expense. Software Development Costs Internal Use Software . Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 10 year period on a straight-line basis. The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed . Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test first requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the Company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, the Company measures and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any. The Company generally bases its measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that the Company expects the reporting unit to generate in the future. The Company's significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: its weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the C ompany determines that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, the Company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Operating Leases The Company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space, and other non-real estate assets under operating leases. Operating lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. Rent expense for non-cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, beginning with the effective lease commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Certain leases also provide for contingent rents, which are determined as a percentage of sales in excess of specified levels. A contingent rent liability is recognized together with the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable. Fair Value Measurements The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives and available-for-sale securities. Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach, and cost approach). The levels of hierarchy are described below: ##TABLE_START  Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. ##TABLE_END The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Pricing vendors are utilized for certain Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates, and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and that of its counterparties. The Companys fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include an analysis of period-over-period fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for additional information. Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactions Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in Total shareholders equity. The Companys global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, the impact of which is recorded in Other expense (income), net , within the Consolidated Statements of Income. Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (a component of Total shareholders equity), Long-term debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge, and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For designated net investment hedges, this is generally within the Cash (used) provided by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. For the Companys fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Refer to Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives. Stock-Based Compensation The Company estimates the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted under the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1990 Plan) and employees purchase rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes this fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as Total selling and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the vesting period using the straight-line method. Refer to Note 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for more information on the Companys stock programs. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. United States income taxes are provided currently on financial statement earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are expected to be repatriated. The Company determines annually the amount of undistributed non-U.S. earnings to invest indefinitely in its non-U.S. operations. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense. Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes for further discussion. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards. Refer to Note 12  Earnings Per Share for further discussion. Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In July 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standards update intended to provide guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits, reflecting the manner in which an entity would settle, at the reporting date, any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position when net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, or tax credit carryforwards exist. This accounting standard is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2014 and early adoption is permitted. Management early adopted this guidance and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. In July 2012, the FASB issued an accounting standards update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. This accounting standard update was effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entitys right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. This new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements. This new guidance was effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. Among other things, the updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_START NOTE 2  Inventories ##TABLE_ENDInventory balances of $3,947 million and $3,484 million at May 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, were substantially all finished goods. ##TABLE_START NOTE 3  Property, Plant and Equipment ##TABLE_ENDProperty, plant and equipment included the following: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   Land  $  $ Buildings  1,261  1,174 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software  3,376  2,985 Leasehold improvements  1,066  Construction in process   Total property, plant and equipment, gross  6,220  5,500 Less accumulated depreciation  3,386  3,048 TOTAL PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET  $ 2,834  $ 2,452 ##TABLE_ENDCapitalized interest was not material for the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 .

These securities are valued using market prices on both active markets (Level 1) and less active markets (Level 2). The gross realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities were immaterial for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities included in Other comprehensive income were immaterial as of May 31, 2014 and 2013. The Company regularly reviews its available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment. For the years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company did not consider its securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired and accordingly, did not recognize any impairment losses. As of May 31, 2014 , the Company held $2,287 million of available-for-sale securities with maturity dates within one year from the purchase date and $635 million with maturity dates over one year and less than five years from the purchase date within short-term investments. As of May 31, 2013 , the Company held $ 2,229 million of available-for-sale securities with maturity dates within one year from purchase date and $ 399 million with maturity dates over one year and less than five years from purchase date within Short-term investments. Included in Interest expense (income), net was interest income related to the Company's available-for-sale securities of $5 million , $4 million , and $6 million for the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively. The Companys Level 3 assets comprise investments in certain non-marketable preferred stock. These Level 3 investments are an immaterial portion of the Company's portfolio. Changes in Level 3 investment assets were immaterial during the years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013 . Derivative financial instruments include foreign exchange forwards and options, embedded derivatives and interest rate swap contracts. Refer to Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives for additional detail. No transfers among the levels within the fair value hierarchy occurred during the years ended May 31, 2014 or 2013 . As of May 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company had no assets or liabilities that were required to be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. For fair value information regarding Notes payable and Long-term debt, refer to Note 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines and Note 8  Long-Term Debt. ##TABLE_START NOTE 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines ##TABLE_ENDNotes payable and interest-bearing accounts payable to Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America) as of May 31, 2014 and 2013 are summarized below: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31,       (Dollars in millions)  Borrowings  Interest Rate   Borrowings  Interest Rate  Notes payable:           U.S. operations  $   0.00 % (1)   $   0.00 % (1)  Non-U.S. operations   10.04 % (1)    4.94 % (1)  TOTAL NOTES PAYABLE  $     $    Interest-Bearing Accounts Payable:           Sojitz America  $  0.94 %   $  0.99 %  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Weighted average interest rate includes non-interest bearing overdrafts. ##TABLE_END The carrying amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for Notes payable approximate fair value. The Company purchases through Sojitz America certain NIKE Brand products it acquires from non-U.S. suppliers. These purchases are for products sold in certain countries in the Company's Emerging Markets geographic segment and Canada, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Accounts payable to Sojitz America are generally due up to 60 days after shipment of goods from the foreign port. The interest rate on such accounts payable is the 60 -day London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as of the beginning of the month of the invoice date, plus 0.75% . As of May 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company had no amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program. On November 1, 2011, the Company entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with lender approval. Following an extension agreement on September 17, 2013 between the Company and the syndicate of banks, the facility matures November 1, 2017, with a one -year extension option exercisable through October 31, 2014. Based on the Companys current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.445% . The facility fee is 0.055% of the total commitment. Under this committed credit facility, the Company must maintain, among other things, certain minimum specified financial ratios with which the Company was in compliance at May 31, 2014 . No amounts were outstanding under this facility as of May 31, 2014 or 2013 . ##TABLE_START NOTE 8  Long-Term Debt ##TABLE_ENDLong-term debt, net of unamortized premiums and discounts and swap fair value adjustments, comprises the following:  ##TABLE_START         Book Value Outstanding As of May 31, Scheduled Maturity (Dollars and Yen in millions)  Original Principal  Interest Rate  Interest Payments   Corporate Bond Payables: (4)           October 1, 2013  $  4.70 %  Semi-Annually  $   $ October 15, 2015 (1)  $  5.15 %  Semi-Annually   May 1, 2023 (5)  $  2.25 %  Semi-Annually   May 1, 2043 (5)  $  3.63 %  Semi-Annually   Promissory Notes:           April 1, 2017 (2)  $  6.20 %  Monthly   January 1, 2018 (2)  $  6.79 %  Monthly   Japanese Yen Notes:           August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020 (3)   9,000  2.60 %  Quarterly   August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020 (3)   4,000  2.00 %  Quarterly   Total        1,206  1,267 Less current maturities         TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT        $ 1,199  $ 1,210 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby the Company receives fixed interest payments at the same rate as the note and pays variable interest payments based on the six -month LIBOR plus a spread. The swaps have the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding note. At May 31, 2014 , the interest rates payable on these swap agreements ranged from approximately 0.2% to 0.4% . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) On May 30, 2013, the Company assumed a total of $59 million in bonds payable as part of its agreement to purchase certain Corporate properties; this was treated as a non-cash financing transaction. The property serves as collateral for the debt. The purchase of these properties was accounted for as a business combination where the total consideration of $85 million was allocated to the land and buildings acquired; no other tangible or intangible assets or liabilities resulted from the purchase. The bonds mature in 2017 and 2018 and the Company does not have the ability to re-negotiate the terms of the debt agreements and would incur significant financial penalties if the notes were paid off prior to maturity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) NIKE Logistics YK assumed a total of 13.0 billion in loans as part of its agreement to purchase a distribution center in Japan, which serves as collateral for the loans. These loans mature in equal quarterly installments during the period August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) These senior unsecured obligations rank equally with the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) The bonds are redeemable at the Company's option prior to February 1, 2023 and November 1, 2042, respectively, at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. Subsequent to February 1, 2023 and November 1, 2042, respectively, the bonds also feature a par call provision which allows for the bonds to be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. ##TABLE_END The scheduled maturity of Long-term debt in each of the years ending May 31, 2015 through 2019 are $7 million , $108 million , $45 million , $25 million and $7 million , respectively, at face value. The fair value of the Companys Long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $1,154 million at May 31, 2014 and $1,219 million at May 31, 2013 . The fair value of Long-term debt is estimated based upon quoted prices of similar instruments (level 2). ##TABLE_START NOTE 9  Income Taxes ##TABLE_ENDIncome before income taxes is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Income before income taxes:       United States  $ 3,066  $ 1,231  $ Foreign   2,025  2,212 TOTAL INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  $ 3,544  $ 3,256  $ 3,011 ##TABLE_ENDThe provision for income taxes is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Current:       United States       Federal  $  $  $ State    Foreign    Total    Deferred:       United States       Federal     (47 ) State  (3 )  (4 )  Foreign  (16 )  (90 )  (29 ) Total  (11 )  (94 )  (71 ) TOTAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDA reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,     Federal income tax rate  35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % State taxes, net of federal benefit  1.8 %  1.4 %  1.3 % Foreign earnings  2.2 %  -11.8 %  -11.9 % Deferred charge  -14.6 %  0.0 %  0.0 % Other, net  -0.4 %  0.1 %  0.6 % EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE  24.0 %  24.7 %  25.0 % ##TABLE_ENDThe effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended May 31, 2014 was 70 basis points lower than the effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended May 31, 2013 primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings from lower tax rate jurisdictions. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014 , the Company reached a resolution with the IRS on a U.S. Unilateral Advanced Pricing Agreement that covers intercompany transfer pricing for fiscal years 2011 through 2020. This agreement resulted in a reduction in the Company's permanently reinvested foreign earnings, which increased the effective income tax rate and Income taxes payable. The agreement also resulted in a reduction of previously unrecognized tax benefits and the creation of a deferred tax charge, both of which reduced the effective income tax rate. The net result of the agreement did not have a material impact on the Companys effective income tax rate in fiscal 2014. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended May 31, 2013 was 30 basis points lower than the effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended May 31, 2012 primarily due to tax benefits received from the intercompany sale of intellectual property rights outside of the U.S., the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development credit and the intra-period allocation of tax expense between continuing operations, discontinued operations and Other comprehensive income. The decrease in the effective rate was partially offset by a higher effective tax rate on operations as a result of an increase in earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets and (liabilities) comprise the following:  ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   Deferred tax assets:     Allowance for doubtful accounts  $  $ Inventories   Sales return reserves   Deferred compensation   Stock-based compensation   Reserves and accrued liabilities   Foreign loss carry-forwards   Foreign tax credit carry-forwards    Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries   Other   Total deferred tax assets   Valuation allowance  (9 )  (5 ) Total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance   Deferred tax liabilities:     Property, plant and equipment  (237 )  (241 ) Intangibles  (94 )  (78 ) Other  (2 )  (20 ) Total deferred tax liability  (333 )  (339 ) NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe following is a reconciliation of the changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)    Unrecognized tax benefits, as of the beginning of the period  $  $  $ Gross increases related to prior period tax positions (1)    Gross decreases related to prior period tax positions (1)  (166 )  (3 )  (25 ) Gross increases related to current period tax positions    Gross decreases related to current period tax positions  (30 )  (9 )  (1 ) Settlements (1)  (676 )    (20 ) Lapse of statute of limitations  (4 )  (21 )  (9 ) Changes due to currency translation  (4 )  (12 )  (11 ) UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014 , the Company reached a resolution with the IRS on a U.S. Unilateral Advanced Pricing Agreement that covers intercompany transfer pricing for fiscal years 2011 through 2020. As a result, the Company recorded a gross increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior period tax positions, a gross decrease in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior period tax positions, and a settlement. The net impact of these items resulted in a decrease to unrecognized tax benefits. ##TABLE_END As of May 31, 2014 , the total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were $506 million , $264 million of which would affect the Company's effective tax rate if recognized in future periods. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense. The liability for payment of interest and penalties increased $55 million , $4 million , and $17 million during the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively. As of May 31, 2014 and 2013 , accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $167 million and $112 million , respectively (excluding federal benefit). The Company is subject to taxation primarily in the United States, China, the Netherlands, and Brazil, as well as various state and other foreign jurisdictions. The Company has concluded substantially all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2010. The Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2011 through 2014 tax years, and many issues are at an advanced stage in the examination process. In addition, the Company is in appeals regarding the validation of foreign tax credits taken. The Companys major foreign jurisdictions, China, the Netherlands and Brazil, have concluded substantially all income tax matters through calendar 2005, fiscal 2008 and calendar 2008, respectively. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in the aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $70 million within the next 12 months. The Company provides for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At May 31, 2014 , the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately $6.6 billion , which includes a reduction of permanently reinvested earnings for the year ended May 31, 2014 . If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences of undistributed earnings would be approximately $2.1 billion at May 31, 2014 . A portion of the Company's foreign operations are benefiting from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2021 . This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The impact of this tax holiday decreased foreign taxes by $138 million , $108 million , and $117 million for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on Diluted earnings per common share was $0.15 , $0.12 , and $0.12 for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively. Deferred tax assets at May 31, 2014 and 2013 were reduced by a valuation allowance relating to tax benefits of certain subsidiaries with operating losses. The net change in the valuation allowance was an increase of $4 million , a decrease of $22 million , and an increase of $23 million for the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively. The Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of $55 million at May 31, 2014 . Such losses will expire as follows:  ##TABLE_START   Year Ending May 31, (In millions)      2019-2034  Indefinite  Total Net operating losses  $   $   $   $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDDuring the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , income tax benefits attributable to employee stock-based compensation transactions of $135 million , $76 million , and $120 million , respectively, were allocated to Total shareholders equity. ##TABLE_START NOTE 10  Redeemable Preferred Stock ##TABLE_ENDSojitz America is the sole owner of the Companys authorized Redeemable p referred s tock, $1 par value, which is redeemable at the option of Sojitz America or the Company at par value aggregating $0.3 million . A cumulative dividend of $0.10 per share is payable annually on May 31 and no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock of the Company unless dividends on the Redeemable p referred s tock have been declared and paid in full. There have been no changes in the Redeemable p referred s tock in the three years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 . As the holder of the Redeemable p referred s tock, Sojitz America does not have general voting rights but does have the right to vote as a separate class on the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, on merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company or on the sale or assignment of the NIKE trademark for athletic footwear sold in the United States. The Redeemable p referred s tock has been fully issued to Sojitz America and is not blank check preferred stock. The Company's articles of incorporation do not permit the issuance of additional preferred stock. ##TABLE_START NOTE 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation ##TABLE_ENDThe authorized number of shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value, and Class B Common Stock, no par value, are 200 million and 1,200 million , respectively. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors. There are no differences in the dividend and liquidation preferences or participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shareholders. In 1990, the Board of Directors adopted, and the shareholders approved, the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1990 Plan). The 1990 Plan, as amended, provides for the issuance of up to 326 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with stock options and other awards granted under the plan. The 1990 Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance-based awards. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the 1990 Plan. The committee has the authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards, and the other terms and conditions of the awards. Substantially all stock option grants outstanding under the 1990 Plan were granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year, vest ratably over four years, and expire 10 years from the date of grant. The following table summarizes the Companys total stock-based compensation expense recognized in Total selling and administrative expense:  ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Stock options (1)  $  $  $ ESPPs    Restricted stock    TOTAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Expense for stock options includes the expense associated with stock appreciation rights. Accelerated stock option expense is recorded for employees eligible for accelerated stock option vesting upon retirement. Accelerated stock option expense for years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 was $15 million , $22 million , and $17 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END As of May 31, 2014 , the Company had $179 million of unrecognized compensation costs from stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, to be recognized as selling and administrative expense over a weighted average period of 2.1 years. The weighted average fair value per share of the options granted during the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , as computed using the Black-Scholes pricing model, was $14.89 , $12.71 , and $11.08 , respectively. The weighted average assumptions used to estimate these fair values are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,     Dividend yield  1.3 %  1.5 %  1.4 % Expected volatility  27.9 %  35.0 %  29.5 % Weighted average expected life (in years)  5.3  5.3  5.0 Risk-free interest rate  1.3 %  0.6 %  1.4 % ##TABLE_ENDThe Company estimates the expected volatility based on the implied volatility in market traded options on the Companys common stock with a term greater than 1 year, along with other factors. The weighted average expected life of options is based on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns. The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rate in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the options. The following summarizes the stock option transactions under the plan discussed above:  ##TABLE_START   Shares (1)  Weighted Average Option Price   (In millions)   Options outstanding May 31, 2011  69.6  $ 25.65 Exercised  (18.0 )  22.81 Forfeited  (1.0 )  35.61 Granted  13.7  45.87 Options outstanding May 31, 2012  64.3  $ 30.59 Exercised  (9.9 )  24.70 Forfeited  (1.3 )  40.14 Granted  14.6  46.55 Options outstanding May 31, 2013  67.7  $ 34.72 Exercised  (11.0 )  28.29 Forfeited  (1.3 )  48.33 Granted  8.1  63.54 Options outstanding May 31, 2014  63.5  $ 39.28 Options exercisable at May 31,      33.9  $ 24.38  35.9  27.70  37.0  31.42 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Includes stock appreciation rights transactions. ##TABLE_END The weighted average contractual life remaining for options outstanding and options exercisable at May 31, 2014 was 6.0 years and 4.6 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable at May 31, 2014 was $2,391 million and $1,682 million , respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value was the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of the options. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 was $474 million , $293 million , and $453 million , respectively. In addition to the 1990 Plan, the Company gives employees the right to purchase shares at a discount to the market price under employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs). Employees are eligible to participate through payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation. At the end of each six -month offering period, shares are purchased by the participants at 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or the end of the offering period. Employees purchased 1.4 million , 1.6 million , and 1.7 million shares during each of the three years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. From time to time, the Company grants restricted stock units and restricted stock to key employees under the 1990 Plan. The number of shares underlying such awards granted to employees during the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 were 0.3 million , 1.6 million , and 0.7 million with weighted average values per share of $63.89 , $46.86 , and $49.49 , respectively. Recipients of restricted stock are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respective shares throughout the period of restriction. Recipients of restricted stock units are entitled to dividend equivalent cash payments upon vesting. The value of all grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units was established by the market price on the date of grant. During the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , the aggregate fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested was $28 million , $25 million , and $22 million , respectively, determined as of the date of vesting. As of May 31, 2014, the Company had $61 million of unrecognized compensation costs from restricted stock units to be recognized in Total selling and administrative expense over a weighted average period of 2.7 years. ##TABLE_START NOTE 12  Earnings Per Share ##TABLE_ENDThe following is a reconciliation from Basic earnings per common share to Diluted earnings per common share. Options to purchase an additional 0.1 million , 0.1 million , and 0.2 million shares of common stock were outstanding at May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively, but were not included in the computation of Diluted earnings per common share because the options were anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions, except per share data)    Determination of shares:       Weighted average common shares outstanding  883.4  897.3  920.0 Assumed conversion of dilutive stock options and awards  22.4  19.1  19.6 DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING  905.8  916.4  939.6        Earnings per share from continuing operations:       Basic earnings per common share  $ 3.05  $ 2.74  $ 2.45 Diluted earnings per common share  $ 2.97  $ 2.68  $ 2.40        Earnings per share from discontinued operations:       Basic earnings per common share  $   $ 0.02  $ (0.05 ) Diluted earnings per common share  $   $ 0.02  $ (0.05 )        Basic earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc.  $ 3.05  $ 2.76  $ 2.40 Diluted earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc.  $ 2.97  $ 2.70  $ 2.35 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START NOTE 13  Benefit Plans ##TABLE_ENDThe Company has a qualified 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan to which all U.S. employees who work at least 1,000 hours in a year are able to participate. The Company matches a portion of employee contributions. Company contributions to the savings plan were $51 million , $46 million , and $42 million for the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively, and are included in Total selling and administrative expense. The terms of the plan also allow for annual discretionary profit sharing contributions to the accounts of eligible employees by the Company as determined by the Board of Directors. Contributions of $49 million , $47 million , and $40 million were made to the plan and are included in Total selling and administrative expense for the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively. The Company also has a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) that was adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by shareholders in September 1997 and later amended in fiscal 2007. The Company recognized $46 million , $50 million , and $51 million of Total selling and administrative expense related to cash awards under the LTIP during the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively. The Company allows certain highly compensated employees and non-employee directors of the Company to defer compensation under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Deferred compensation plan liabilities were $390 million and $326 million at May 31, 2014 and May 31, 2013, respectively, and classified as long-term in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities. The Company has pension plans in various countries worldwide. The pension plans are only available to local employees and are generally government mandated. The liability related to the unfunded pension liabilities of the plans was $100 million and $104 million at May 31, 2014 and May 31, 2013 , respectively, which was primarily classified as long-term in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities. ##TABLE_START NOTE 14  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ##TABLE_ENDThe changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In millions)  Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment (1)  Cash Flow Hedges  Net Investment Hedges (1)  Other  Total Balance at May 31, 2013  $  $  $  $ (55 )  $ Other comprehensive gains (losses) before reclassifications (2)  (32 )  (134 )      (166 ) Reclassifications to net income of previously deferred (gains) losses (3)    (27 )     (23 ) Other comprehensive income (loss)  (32 )  (161 )     (189 ) Balance at May 31, 2014  $  $  $  $ (51 )  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment and net investment hedge gains/losses related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary are reclassified to Net income upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the respective entity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Net of tax benefit of $ 0 million , $ 9 million , $ 0 million , $ 0 million , and $ 9 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Net of tax expense of $ 0 million , $ 9 million , $ 0 million , $ 0 million , and $ 9 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the reclassifications from Accumulated other comprehensive income to the Consolidated Statements of Income: ##TABLE_START   Amount of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income  Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income    (In millions)  Year Ended May 31, 2014  Gains on cash flow hedges:     Foreign exchange forwards and options  $  Revenues Foreign exchange forwards and options   Cost of sales Foreign exchange forwards and options    Total selling and administrative expense Foreign exchange forwards and options   Other expense (income), net Total before tax    Tax expense  (9 )   Gain, net of tax    Losses on other  (4 )  Other expense (income), net Total before tax  (4 )   Tax expense     Loss, net of tax  (4 )   Total net gain reclassified for the period  $   ##TABLE_ENDRefer to Note 17 Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Company's risk management program and derivatives. ##TABLE_START NOTE 15  Discontinued Operations ##TABLE_ENDDuring the year ended May 31, 2013 , the Company divested of Umbro and Cole Haan, allowing it to focus its resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse, and Hurley brands. On February 1, 2013, the Company completed the sale of Cole Haan to Apax Partners for an agreed upon purchase price of $570 million and received at closing $561 million , net of $9 million of purchase price adjustments. The transaction resulted in a gain on sale of $231 million , net of $137 million in Income tax expense; this gain is included in the Net income (loss) from discontinued operations line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no adjustments to these recorded amounts as of May 31, 2014 . Beginning November 30, 2012, the Company classified the Cole Haan disposal group as held-for-sale and presented the results of Cole Haan's operations in the Net income (loss) from discontinued operations line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. From this date until the sale, the assets and liabilities of Cole Haan were recorded in the Assets of discontinued operations and Liabilities of discontinued operations line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. Previously, these amounts were reported in the Company's segment presentation as Other Businesses. Under the sale agreement, the Company agreed to provide certain transition services to Cole Haan for an expected period of 3 to 9 months from the date of sale. These services were essentially complete as of May 31, 2013 and the Company has had no significant involvement with Cole Haan beyond the transition services. The Company has also licensed NIKE proprietary Air and Lunar technologies to Cole Haan for a transition period. The continuing cash flows related to these items are not significant to Cole Haan. Additionally, preexisting guarantees of certain Cole Haan lease payments remained in place after the sale; the maximum exposure under the guarantees is $ 33 million at May 31, 2014 . The fair value of the guarantees is not material. On November 30, 2012, the Company completed the sale of certain assets of Umbro to Iconix Brand Group (Iconix) for $ 225 million . The Umbro disposal group was classified as held-for-sale as of November 30, 2012 and the results of Umbro's operations are presented in the Net income (loss) from discontinued operations line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The liabilities of Umbro were recorded in the Liabilities of discontinued operations line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Previously, these amounts were reported in the Company's segment presentation as Other Businesses. Upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria, the Company recorded a loss of $ 107 million , net of tax, on the sale of Umbro and the loss is included in the Net income (loss) from discontinued operations line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The loss on sale was calculated as the net sales price less Umbro assets of $ 248 million , including intangibles, goodwill, and fixed assets, other miscellaneous charges of $ 22 million , and the release of the associated cumulative translation adjustment of $ 129 million . The tax benefit on the loss was $ 67 million . There were no adjustments to these recorded amounts as of May 31, 2014 . Under the sale agreement, the Company provided transition services to Iconix while certain markets were transitioned to Iconix-designated licensees. These transition services are complete and the Company has wound down the remaining operations of Umbro. Summarized results of the Company's discontinued operations are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Revenues  $   $  $ Income (loss) before income taxes     (43 ) Income tax expense     Net income (loss) from discontinued operations  $   $  $ (46 ) ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2014 and 2013 , the aggregate components of liabilities classified as discontinued operations and included in Total current liabilities consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   Accounts payable  $   $ Accrued liabilities    TOTAL LIABILITIES  $   $ ##TABLE_ENDThere were no assets of discontinued operations as of May 31, 2014 and May 31, 2013 . ##TABLE_START NOTE 16  Commitments and Contingencies ##TABLE_ENDThe Company leases space for certain of its offices, warehouses and retail stores under leases expiring from 1 to 20 years after May 31, 2014 . Rent expense was $533 million , $482 million , and $431 million for the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Amounts of minimum future annual commitments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases are as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START        Thereafter  Total Operating leases  $  $  $  $  $  $ 1,050  $ 2,804 Capital leases  $  $  $  $  $  $   $ ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling $135 million and $149 million , respectively. These letters of credit were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and guarantees of the Companys performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. In connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the Companys historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of its pending legal matters with certainty, the Company does not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ##TABLE_START NOTE 17  Risk Management and Derivatives ##TABLE_ENDThe Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2014 are designated as cash flow or fair value hedges. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date. The total notional amount of outstanding derivatives as of May 31, 2014 was approximately $12 billion , which primarily comprises cash flow hedges for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. As of May 31, 2014 , there were outstanding currency forward contracts with maturities up to 24 months. The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2014 and 2013 :  ##TABLE_START   Asset Derivatives  Liability Derivatives (In millions)  Balance Sheet Location    Balance Sheet Location   Derivatives formally designated as hedging instruments:             Foreign exchange forwards and options  Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $  $  Accrued liabilities  $  $ Foreign exchange forwards and options  Deferred income taxes and other assets    Deferred income taxes and other liabilities    Interest rate swap contracts  Deferred income taxes and other assets    Deferred income taxes and other liabilities     Total derivatives formally designated as hedging instruments         Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:             Foreign exchange forwards and options  Prepaid expenses and other current assets    Accrued liabilities   Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments         TOTAL DERIVATIVES    $  $    $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe following tables present the amounts affecting the Consolidated Statements of Income for years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 : ##TABLE_START (In millions)  Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income on Derivatives (1)  Amount of Gain (Loss) Reclassified From Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income (1) Year Ended May 31,  Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified From Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Into Income (1)  Year Ended May 31,      Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges:               Foreign exchange forwards and options  $ (48 )  $  $ (29 )  Revenues  $  $ (19 )  $ Foreign exchange forwards and options  (78 )    Cost of sales    (57 ) Foreign exchange forwards and options   (3 )   Total selling and administrative expense     (2 ) Foreign exchange forwards and options  (21 )    Other expense (income), net    (9 ) Total designated cash flow hedges  $ (143 )  $  $    $  $  $ (63 ) Derivatives designated as net investment hedges:               Foreign exchange forwards and options  $   $   $  Other expense (income), net  $   $   $  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) For the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , the amounts recorded in Other expense (income), net as a result of hedge ineffectiveness and the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because the forecasted transactions were no longer probable of occurring were immaterial. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivatives  Location of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivatives   Year Ended May 31,  (In millions)     Derivatives designated as fair value hedges:         Interest rate swaps (1)  $  $  $  Interest expense (income), net Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:         Foreign exchange forwards and options  $ (75 )  $  $  Other expense (income), net Embedded derivatives  $ (1 )  $ (4 )  $  Other expense (income), net ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) All interest rate swap agreements meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.

Cash Flow Hedges The purpose of the Companys foreign currency hedging activities is to reduce the volatility of the Company's cash flows resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Foreign currency exposures that the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external and intercompany revenues, selling and administrative expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain intercompany transactions. Product cost exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below. NIKE entities primarily purchase products in two ways: (1) Some NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC; (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. In January 2012, the Company implemented a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the Company's existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, the Companys payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order. Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order and their accounting treatment is described further below. The Companys policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. Hedged transactions are denominated primarily in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. Typically the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. All changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, excluding any ineffective portion, are recorded in Other comprehensive income until Net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. In most cases, amounts recorded in Other comprehensive income will be released to Net income sometime after the maturity of the related derivative. Effective hedge results are classified within the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure, with the results of hedges of non-functional currency denominated revenues and product cost exposures, excluding embedded derivatives as described below, recorded in Revenues or Cost of sales, when the underlying hedged transaction affects consolidated Net income. Results of hedges of selling and administrative expense are recorded together with those costs when the related expense is recorded. Results of hedges of anticipated purchases and sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities are recorded in Other expense (income), net when the securities are sold. Results of hedges of certain anticipated intercompany transactions are recorded in Other expense (income), net when the transaction occurs. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from these designated cash flow hedge derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, generally within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Premiums paid on options are initially recorded as deferred charges. The Company assesses the effectiveness of options based on the total cash flows method and records total changes in the options fair value to Other comprehensive income to the degree they are effective. The Company formally assesses, both at a hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Effectiveness for cash flow hedges is assessed based on changes in forward rates. Ineffectiveness was immaterial for the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 . The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it determines that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item (including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions); (2) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (3) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, but is expected to occur within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in Accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified to Net income when the forecasted transaction affects consolidated Net income. However, if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were accumulated in Other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in Other expense (income), net . In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry the derivative at its fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, recognizing future changes in the fair value in Other expense (income), net . For the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , the amounts recorded in Other expense (income), net as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedging because the forecasted transaction was no longer probable of occurring were immaterial . As of May 31, 2014 , $10 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives accumulated in Other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2014 , the maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions is 24 months. Fair Value Hedges The Company is also exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives currently used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. As of May 31, 2014 , all interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt and meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. The cash flows associated with the Companys fair value hedges are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding, which are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , or 2012 . Net Investment Hedges The Company has hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign-currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges, except ineffective portions, are reported in the Cumulative translation adjustment component of Other comprehensive income along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its net investment hedges within the Cash (used) provided by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness based on changes in forward rates. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its net investment hedges for the years ended May 31, 2014 , 2013 , or 2012 . Embedded Derivatives As part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related purchase order and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other expense (income), net from the date a purchase order is accepted by a factory through the date the purchase price is no longer subject to foreign currency fluctuations. At May 31, 2014 , the notional amount of embedded derivatives was approximately $100 million . Undesignated Derivative Instruments The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/or the embedded derivative contracts explained above. These forwards are not designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, these undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other expense (income), net , together with the re-measurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position or embedded derivative contract. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from undesignated instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, generally within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. However, this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored. The Companys derivative contracts contain credit risk related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Companys bilateral credit related contingent features generally require the owing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50 million should the fair value of outstanding derivatives to either counterparty be greater than $50 million . Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also trigger collateral requirements. As of May 31, 2014 , the Company was in compliance with all credit risk related contingent features and the fair value of its derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position was $22 million . Accordingly, the Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features. Further, as of May 31, 2014 those counterparties which were required to post collateral complied with such requirements. Given the considerations described above, the Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial . ##TABLE_START NOTE 18  Operating Segments and Related Information ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The Company's operating segments have changed beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to mirror the changes in the structure of the Companys internal organization that were effective during the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The NIKE Brand segments continue to be defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity and also include the results of NIKE Golf and Hurley, which are now managed within the geographies. Previously, NIKE Golf and Hurley were combined with Converse and reported as \"Other Businesses.\" Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. The Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. The Companys NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for NIKE, Inc., and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing, and selling of casual sneakers, apparel, and accessories. Prior period segment information has been restated to reflect these changes. Global Brand Divisions is included within the NIKE Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. Global Brand Divisions primarily represent NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment, Demand creation expense and Operating overhead expense that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand, and costs associated with product development and supply chain operations. Corporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments, depreciation and amortization related to the Companys headquarters, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, including stock-based compensation, certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses, certain corporate eliminations and other items. The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (commonly referred to as EBIT), which represents Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Reconciling items for EBIT represent corporate expense items that are not allocated to the operating segments for management reporting. As part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine months in advance of the future selling season based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established.

Business ##TABLE_START General ##TABLE_END NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the State of Oregon. As used in this report, the terms we, us, NIKE, and the Company refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our NIKE e-commerce website is located at www.nike.com. On our NIKE corporate website, located at news.nike.com, we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC): our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our definitive Proxy Statements are also posted on our corporate website. All such filings on our corporate website are available free of charge. Copies of these filings may also be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549, or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains a website ( www.sec.gov ) that contains current, quarterly and annual reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically. Also available on our corporate website are the charters of the committees of our Board of Directors, as well as our corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics; copies of any of these documents will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores and internet websites (which we refer to as our Direct to Consumer or \"DTC\" operations), and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees throughout the world. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Practically all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment products are produced both in the United States and abroad. ##TABLE_START Products ##TABLE_END We focus our NIKE Brand product offerings in eight key categories: Running, Basketball, Football (Soccer), Mens Training, Womens Training, Action Sports, Sportswear (our sports-inspired lifestyle products) and Golf. Basketball includes our Jordan Brand product offerings and Men's Training includes our baseball and American football product offerings. We also market products designed for kids, as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as cricket, lacrosse, tennis, volleyball, wrestling, walking and outdoor activities. NIKEs athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on high-quality construction and innovation in our products. Sportswear, Running, Basketball and Football (Soccer) are currently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales. We sell sports apparel covering most of the above-mentioned categories, which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use and exemplifies our commitment to innovation and high-quality construction. Sportswear, Men's Training, Running and Football (Soccer) are currently our top-selling apparel categories and we expect them to continue to lead in apparel sales. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in collections of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos. We sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment, golf clubs and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc. Our Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on Basketball using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results for the Jordan Brand are included within the NIKE Brand Basketball category and within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. One of our wholly owned subsidiary brands, Hurley, headquartered in Costa Mesa, California (Hurley), designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the Hurley trademark. Sales and operating results for Hurley are included within the NIKE Brand Action Sports category and within the NIKE Brand's North America geographic operating segment, respectively. Another of our wholly owned subsidiary brands, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts (Converse), designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis. In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our DTC operations, we have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities. On February 1, 2013, and November 30, 2012, we completed the divestitures of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses, respectively, allowing us to better focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Hurley and Converse brands. ##TABLE_START Sales and Marketing ##TABLE_END Financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in Note 18  Operating Segments and Related Information of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, operating and logistics-related factors. Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. Our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment, and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. ##TABLE_START United States Market ##TABLE_ENDFor both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 , NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 46% of total revenues, compared to 45% for fiscal 2013 . We sell our NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to thousands of retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit sales as well as independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf and skateboarding. During fiscal 2015 , our three largest customers accounted for approximately 26% of sales in the United States. We make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price. In fiscal 2015 , 87% of our U.S. wholesale footwear shipments (excluding NIKE Golf, Hurley and Converse) were made under the futures program, compared to 86% in fiscal 2014 and 87% in fiscal 2013 . In fiscal 2015 , 67% of our U.S. wholesale apparel shipments (excluding NIKE Golf, Hurley and Converse) were made under the futures program, compared to 71% in fiscal 2014 and 67% in fiscal 2013 . Our Direct to Consumer operations sell NIKE Brand products, including Jordan Brand and Hurley, to consumers through our e-commerce website, www.nike.com . We also sell Converse products to consumers through a Converse owned e-commerce website, www.converse.com . In addition, our Direct to Consumer operations sell through the following number of retail stores in the United States: ##TABLE_START U.S. Retail Stores Number NIKE Brand factory stores NIKE Brand in-line stores, including employee-only stores Converse stores (including factory stores) Hurley stores (including factory and employee stores) TOTAL ##TABLE_ENDNIKE owns a full product line distribution center located in Memphis, Tennessee. In addition, NIKE has four other distribution centers, three of which are leased, also located in Memphis. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our leased Foothill Ranch, California distribution center. Converse and Hurley products are shipped primarily from leased facilities in Ontario, California. ##TABLE_START International Markets ##TABLE_ENDFor both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 , non-U.S. NIKE Brand and Converse sales accounted for 54% of total revenues, compared with 55% for fiscal 2013 . We sell our products to retail accounts, through our own Direct to Consumer operations and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives around the world. We sell to thousands of retail accounts and ship products from 45 distribution centers outside of the United States. In many countries and regions, including Canada, Asia, some Latin American countries and Europe, we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the United States futures ordering program described above. During fiscal 2015 , NIKEs three largest customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 12% of total non-U.S. sales. Our Direct to Consumer business operates the following number of retail stores outside the United States, in addition to NIKE and Converse owned e-commerce websites in over 25 countries: ##TABLE_START Non-U.S. Retail Stores Number NIKE Brand factory stores NIKE Brand in-line stores, including employee-only stores Converse stores (including factory stores) TOTAL ##TABLE_ENDInternational branch offices and subsidiaries of NIKE are located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and Vietnam. ##TABLE_START Significant Customer ##TABLE_ENDNo customer accounted for 10% or more of our worldwide net sales during fiscal 2015 . ##TABLE_START Orders ##TABLE_ENDWorldwide futures orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from June through November 2015, were $13.5 billion compared with $13.3 billion for the same period last year. This futures orders amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders and the fulfillment of certain of these futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of discounts, order cancellations and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including at-once and closeout sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations and sales from our Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf businesses. ##TABLE_START Product Research, Design and Development ##TABLE_ENDWe believe our research, design and development efforts are key factors in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as NIKE strives to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort while reducing waste. In addition to NIKEs own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs, materials, concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process. As we continue to develop new technologies, NIKE is simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories. Using market intelligence and research, the various NIKE design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumer preferences. The proliferation of NIKE Air, Lunar, Zoom, Free, Flywire, Dri-Fit, Flyknit, Flyweave and NIKE+ technologies through Running, Basketball, Men's Training, Women's Training and Sportswear, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products. ##TABLE_START Manufacturing ##TABLE_ENDWe are supplied by approximately 146 footwear factories located in 14 countries. The largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 7% of total fiscal 2015 NIKE Brand footwear production. Virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers who often operate multiple factories. In fiscal 2015 , contract factories in Vietnam, China and Indonesia manufactured approximately 43%, 32% and 20% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. We also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in Argentina, Brazil, India and Mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. In fiscal 2015 , five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of footwear production, and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69% of NIKE Brand footwear production. We are supplied by approximately 408 apparel factories located in 39 countries. The largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 11% of total fiscal 2015 NIKE Brand apparel production. Virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories. In fiscal 2015 , most of this apparel production occurred in China, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Cambodia. In fiscal 2015 , one apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more than 10% of apparel production, and the top five contract manufacturers in aggregate accounted for approximately 36% of NIKE Brand apparel production. The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and canvas, as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2015 , NIKE IHM, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NIKE, Inc., with facilities near Beaverton, Oregon and in St. Louis, Missouri, and independent contractors in China and Vietnam, were our largest suppliers of the Air-Sole cushioning components used in footwear. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads (both virgin and recycled); specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware. NIKEs independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. NIKE's independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products. Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed significant import-export financing services for us. During fiscal 2015 , Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Brazil, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa and Thailand, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 8% of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates. Our current agreements with Sojitz America expire on May 31, 2018, and contain a provision allowing us to extend the agreements to May 31, 2019. ##TABLE_START International Operations and Trade ##TABLE_ENDOur international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as possible increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future. In recent years, uncertain global and regional economic conditions have affected international trade and caused a rise in protectionist actions around the world. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional measures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole. We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions. In Brazil and Argentina, we are actively participating in dumping investigations against footwear from China and actively monitoring actions in other countries that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. Moreover, with respect to trade restrictions targeting China, which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us, we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules, and (iii) reflects and considers China's domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community. Where trade protection measures are implemented, we believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability. NIKE advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements. The passage of Trade Promotion Authority in the United States will enable the conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). If ultimately passed, the TPP has the potential to reduce or eliminate high rates of customs duties for imports into the United States of NIKE products sourced from TPP countries (primarily footwear and apparel from Vietnam and apparel from Malaysia). Similarly, the European Union is close to concluding a free trade agreement with Vietnam that could lead to duty reduction or elimination for footwear and apparel. ##TABLE_START Competition ##TABLE_ENDThe athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment, including adidas, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, Puma, V.F. Corp., Under Armour and UNIQLO, among others. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment in the world. Important aspects of competition in this industry are: ##TABLE_START  Product attributes such as quality; performance and reliability; new product innovation and development and consumer price/value. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consumer connection and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing and promotion; social media interaction; customer support and service; identification with prominent and influential athletes, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and online. ##TABLE_END We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas. ##TABLE_START Trademarks and Patents ##TABLE_ENDWe utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh Design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have sought and obtained trademark registrations. NIKE has copyright protection in its design, graphics and other original works. When appropriate, we have sought registrations for this content. NIKE owns patents, and has a patent license, facilitating its use of Air technologies. The \"Air\" process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane. Some of the early patents directed to the Air technologies have expired, which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology. Subsequent NIKE patents directed to the Air technologies will not expire for several years. We also file and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility patents, as well as many U.S. and foreign design patents protecting components, manufacturing techniques, features and industrial design used in various athletic and leisure footwear, apparel, athletic equipment, digital devices and golf products. These patents expire at various times; and patents issued for original applications filed this calendar year in the United States may last until 2030 for design patents and until 2035 for utility patents. We believe our success depends primarily upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patent and trade secret positions. However, we have followed a policy of filing patent applications for the United States and select foreign countries on inventions, designs and improvements that we deem valuable. We also continue to vigorously protect our trademarks and patents against third-party infringement. ##TABLE_START Employees ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2015 , we had approximately 62,600 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. Management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent. None of our employees are represented by a union, except for certain employees in the Emerging Markets geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into and/or comply with industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements. ##TABLE_START Executive Officers of the Registrant ##TABLE_ENDThe executive officers of NIKE, Inc. as of July 17, 2015 are as follows: Philip H.

Risk Factors Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Analyst Reports Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historic information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKEs business plans, objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports, filings with the SEC, press releases, conferences or otherwise, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain the words believe, anticipate, expect, estimate, project, will be, will continue, will likely result or words or phrases of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the SEC, including reports filed on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, and include, among others, the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear, apparel and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products; difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for NIKE products and the various market factors described above; difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining NIKEs increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control; interruptions in data and information technology systems; consumer data security; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance futures orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes in shipment timing, the changing mix of futures and at-once orders, and discounts, order cancellations and returns; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKEs products; increases in the cost of materials, labor and energy used to manufacture products; new product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; product performance and quality; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors and licensees; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in NIKE's debt ratings; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas, political and economic instability and terrorism; changes in government regulations; the impact of, including business and legal developments relating to, climate change; natural disasters; liability and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the effects of NIKE's decision to invest in or divest of businesses and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKEs business and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks, nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on NIKEs business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKEs policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE. Our products face intense competition. NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive in the United States and on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products. Product offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, customer service and social media presence are areas of intense competition. This, in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly. Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business. Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, product innovation and product quality. Our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design (including materials) and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity. In addition, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. Negative posts or comments about us on social networking websites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image. If we do not maintain, extend and expand our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits. Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media and online advertising. If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our products. Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products. Research and development plays a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could harm our business. We establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues to develop, evaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with consumers. However, as competition in our industry has increased, the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased. If we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. As a result, our brands, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be harmed. Furthermore, if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues, could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products, or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings. A majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States. As a result, we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates globally. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected, and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities. Global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world, and most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies. If global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition: ##TABLE_START  Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts, increased inventories and lower gross margins. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We conduct transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum derivatives) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If retailers of our products experience declining revenues, or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products. ##TABLE_END Our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of global sporting events, including without limitation the Olympics and the World Cup. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, availability of import quotas, transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues. We make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price. Our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory, purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. We report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports. Although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues, reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for any future period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, shipping timing, returns and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including at-once and closeout sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations and sales from our Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf businesses. Our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins, cash flows and harm to our business. We purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships and diminish brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance. We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers. We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products, we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be canceled, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A slowing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products. Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk, and impair our ability to sell products. The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retailers with many stores. These retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. These situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity, it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. In addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues. Our Direct to Consumer operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources, and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Our Direct to Consumer stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our Direct to Consumer operations, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs. Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Companys control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud; mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation. In addition, extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business. If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our e-commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected. Many of our customers shop with us through our e-commerce website and mobile commerce applications. Increasingly, customers are using tablets and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly e-commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Risks specific to our e-commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers' brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands. Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business. We believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success and our competitive position. We periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products. The actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights. We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, use, importation and/or sale of certain products. We take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information. Such actions include contractual measures such as entering into non-disclosure and non-compete agreements and providing confidential information awareness training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information might not always be effective. Confidential information that is related to business strategy, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, a decline in our stock price and/or a negative impact on our market position, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties or injunctions. In addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, including outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. We are subject to the risk that our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands. We currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. If our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships, supplier relationships or credit risks, it could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. We also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees. The misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us. We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results, operations or reputation. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data, misappropriation of our consumers or employees personal information or a disruption of our business, which could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data. Any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits. Failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct, local laws and other standards could harm our business. We work with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to manufacture our products, and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property. We require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental, health and safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety. Notwithstanding their contractual obligations, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business. Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products. In addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries, and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions. The Company's most significant tax liabilities are incurred in the United States, China and the Netherlands. If our capital or financing needs in the U.S. require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels, our effective income tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted. Current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., subject to significant change. There have been proposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows. Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world and any repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. We and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that these transactions reflect the accurate economic allocation of profit and that the proper transfer pricing documentation is in place, the profit allocation and transfer pricing terms and conditions may be scrutinized by local tax authorities during an audit and any resulting changes may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates. Portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings that expire in whole or in part from time to time. These tax holidays and rulings may be extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not met. If the tax holidays and rulings are not extended, or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate, then our effective tax rate would increase in the future. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. As part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterpartys liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. We rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products. NIKE is supplied by approximately 146 footwear factories located in 14 countries. We do not own or operate any of our own footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell. In fiscal 2015, five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of fiscal 2015 footwear production, and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69% of NIKE Brand footwear production in fiscal 2015. Our ability to meet our customers' needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers. If one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship, we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing. The principal materials used in our apparel products  natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat or repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware  are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. The principal materials used in our footwear products  natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, canvas and polyurethane films  are also locally available to manufacturers. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate, train, employ and retain adequate personnel. NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured. There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. Further, our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future, unexpected increases in work wages, whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short- and long- term. Because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers, could adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air freight, which could adversely affect our profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins. In addition, Sojitz America performs significant import-export financing services for the Company. During fiscal 2015, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Brazil, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa and Thailand (collectively the \"Sojitz Markets\"), excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the Sojitz Markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. Our success depends on our global distribution facilities. We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, particularly in emerging markets, depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities. We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. We are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party hosted services (information technology systems), across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities. Our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems. Over a number of years, we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Our work to integrate and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers or other causes, or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. We also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. Furthermore, we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection and use for digital marketing, digital commerce and the marketing and use of our NIKE+ products and services. We also engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Our information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. The market for prime real estate is competitive. Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, both domestically and internationally, depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases. In addition, from time to time, we seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition or close some of our real estate locations, which may require modification of an existing lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, customers, distribution centers and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. From time to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses, product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses, such as our retail operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost-effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. However, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business. The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources. From time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business. Our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business. Our future success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. The sale of a large number of shares of common stock owned or managed by our Chairman and related entities could depress the market price of our common stock. As of June 30, 2015, Philip H. Knight, Co-founder and Chairman of our Board of Directors, and Swoosh, LLC, an entity formed to manage 128,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock formerly owned by Mr. Knight, beneficially owned more than 82% of our Class A Common Stock. If on June 30, 2015 all of the aforementioned Class A Common Stock were converted into Class B Common Stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 17.7%. The Class A Common Stock shares are available for resale, subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options. Our long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by Standard  Poors and Moodys Investors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default, and as a result, the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt. If our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results could be adversely affected. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventories, contingent payments under endorsement contracts, accounting for property, plant and equipment and definite-lived assets and goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock. Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock. There are provisions of our articles of incorporation and Oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, a freeze-out statute, two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company. We may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline. Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts estimates of our future performance. Analysts estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. ", "2": " ITEM 2. Properties The following is a summary of principal properties owned or leased by NIKE. The NIKE World Campus, owned by NIKE and located near Beaverton, Oregon, USA, is a 394-acre facility of 44 buildings which, together with adjacent leased properties, functions as our world headquarters and is occupied by approximately 9,200 employees engaged in management, research, design, development, marketing, finance and other administrative functions serving nearly all of our divisions. We also lease various office facilities in the surrounding metropolitan area. We lease a similar, but smaller, administrative facility in Hilversum, the Netherlands, which serves as the headquarters for the Western Europe and Central  Eastern Europe geographies, and manages certain brand management functions for our non-U.S. operations. We also lease an office complex in Shanghai, China, our headquarters for Greater China, occupied by employees focused on implementing our wholesale, DTC and merchandising strategies in the region, among other functions. In the United States, NIKE owns a full product line distribution center located in Memphis, Tennessee. In addition, NIKE has four other distribution centers, three of which are leased, also located in Memphis. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California distribution center, which we lease. Smaller leased distribution facilities for non-NIKE Brand businesses are located in various parts of the United States. We also own or lease distribution and customer service facilities outside the United States. The most significant are the distribution facilities located in Laakdal, Belgium; Taicang, China; Tomisato, Japan and Incheon, Korea, all of which we own. NIKE IHM, Inc. manufactures Air-Sole cushioning components at NIKE-owned facilities located near Beaverton, Oregon and in St. Charles, Missouri. We also manufacture and sell small amounts of various other plastic products to other manufacturers through NIKE IHM, Inc. Aside from the principal properties described above, we lease many offices worldwide for sales and administrative purposes. We lease approximately 930 retail stores worldwide, which consist primarily of factory outlet stores. See United States Market and International Markets in Part I of this Report.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned in-line and factory retail stores and NIKE-owned internet websites (which we refer to as our Direct to Consumer or \"DTC\" operations), and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, must have products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online. In addition to achieving long-term, sustainable revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas: ##TABLE_START  Expanding gross margin by: ##TABLE_END - Delivering innovative, premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a balanced price-to-value proposition for consumers; - Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation; - Making our supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation, help reduce waste and have long-term potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market; and - Driving growth in our higher gross margin DTC business as part of an integrated marketplace growth strategy across our DTC and wholesale operations. ##TABLE_START  Optimizing selling and administrative expense by focusing on: ##TABLE_END - Investments in consumer engagement that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit; - Infrastructure investments that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations; and - Increasing the productivity of our legacy infrastructure. ##TABLE_START  Improving working capital efficiency; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Deploying capital effectively. ##TABLE_END Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals continue to be: ##TABLE_START  High single-digit revenue growth, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Mid-teens earnings per share growth, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Strong return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sustainable, profitable, long-term growth through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. ##TABLE_END Over the past ten years, we have achieved many of these financial goals. During this time, revenues and diluted earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc., inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, have grown 8% and 13%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. Our return on invested capital has increased from 23.2% to 28.1% and we expanded gross margins by approximately 150 basis points. On November 15, 2012, we announced a two-for-one stock split of both Class A and Class B Common shares. The stock split was in the form of a 100% stock dividend payable on December 24, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 10, 2012. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 26, 2012. All share numbers and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. Our fiscal 2015 results from continuing operations demonstrated NIKE's ongoing commitment to deliver consistent growth in revenues, earnings and cash returns to shareholders, while investing for long-term growth. Despite significant foreign currency headwinds, we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2015. NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 10% to $30.6 billion, gross margin expanded 120 basis points, Net income from continuing operations increased 22% to $3.3 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 25% to $3.70. Earnings before interest and income taxes (\"EBIT\") from continuing operations increased 18% for fiscal 2015, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion, which more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. The increase in revenues was attributable to growth across nearly all NIKE Brand geographies, key categories and product types. This broad-based growth was primarily fueled by: ##TABLE_START  Innovative performance and sportswear products, incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE Air, Free, Zoom, Lunar, Flywire, Dri-Fit and Flyknit; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Deep brand connections to consumers through a category lens, reinforced by investments in endorsements by high-profile athletes, sports teams and leagues, high-impact marketing around global sporting events (such as the World Cup and NFL Super Bowl) and digital marketing; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Strong category retail presentation online and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores. ##TABLE_END Our Converse business also grew, with revenue and EBIT growth of 18% and 4%, respectively. Gross margin increased primarily due to higher average selling prices and the favorable impact of our higher-margin DTC businesses, partially offset by higher product input costs, primarily a result of labor input cost inflation and shifts in mix to higher-cost products. For fiscal 2015, the growth of our net income from continuing operations was positively affected by a year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate of 180 basis points primarily due to the favorable resolution of audits in several jurisdictions. In addition, diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 2% decrease in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program. While foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above. ##TABLE_START Results of Operations ##TABLE_END Unless otherwise indicated, the following disclosures reflect the Companys continuing operations. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data)  Fiscal 2015  Fiscal 2014  % Change  Fiscal 2013  % Change Revenues  $ 30,601  $ 27,799  %  $ 25,313  % Cost of sales  16,534  15,353  %  14,279  % Gross profit  14,067  12,446  %  11,034  % Gross margin %  46.0 %  44.8 %   43.6 %  Demand creation expense  3,213  3,031  %  2,745  % Operating overhead expense  6,679  5,735  %  5,051  % Total selling and administrative expense  9,892  8,766  %  7,796  % % of Revenues  32.3 %  31.5 %    30.8 %  Interest expense (income), net      (3 )   Other (income) expense, net  (58 )     (15 )   Income before income taxes  4,205  3,544  %  3,256  % Income tax expense    %   % Effective tax rate  22.2 %  24.0 %   24.7 %  Net income from continuing operations  3,273  2,693  %  2,451  % Net income from discontinued operations (1)          Net income  $ 3,273  $ 2,693  %  $ 2,472  % Diluted earnings per common share - continuing operations  $ 3.70  $ 2.97  %  $ 2.68  % Diluted earnings per common share - discontinued operations (1)  $   $     $ 0.02   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) During fiscal 2013, we divested of Umbro and Cole Haan, allowing us to focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands.

NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our Direct to Consumer operations which are charged at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6) Others include all unisex products, equipment and other products not allocated to Men  s, Women  s and Young Athletes  , as well as certain adjustments that are not allocated to products designated by gender or age. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7) Others include all other categories and certain adjustments that are not allocated at the category level. ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  On a currency-neutral basis, revenues from NIKE, Inc. continuing operations grew 14% for fiscal 2015, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and Converse. Every NIKE Brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2015 as our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers. North America contributed 5 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. revenues, while Western Europe contributed 4 percentage points, Greater China contributed 2 percentage points and Central  Eastern Europe, Emerging Markets and Converse each contributed 1 percentage point. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 17% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 1% during fiscal 2015. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2015 was driven by strong performance in our Sportswear, Basketball, Running and Football (Soccer) categories. Footwear unit sales in fiscal 2015 increased 9% and increases in average selling price per pair contributed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per pair was driven primarily by shifts in mix to higher-priced products, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of growth in our higher-priced DTC business. The constant-currency increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2015 was driven by growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running and Women's Training, which were partially offset by a decline in Football (Soccer) due largely to the comparison to significant sales of replica apparel in advance of the World Cup in 2014. Fiscal 2015 unit sales of apparel increased 8% and increases in average selling price per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per unit was driven primarily by increased revenues from our higher-priced DTC business. While wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to expand our DTC businesses in each of our geographies. Our NIKE Brand DTC operations include NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through NIKE-owned websites. For fiscal 2015, DTC revenues represented approximately 23% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 20% in fiscal 2014. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues grew 29% for fiscal 2015, driven by strong comparable store sales growth of 16%, significant online sales growth and the addition of new stores. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Online sales through NIKE-owned websites, which are not included in comparable store sales, grew 59% in fiscal 2015. Online sales represented approximately 18% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2015 compared to 15% for fiscal 2014. On a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2015 NIKE Brand Mens revenues increased 9%, driven by growth in our Sportswear, Basketball and Running categories. Womens revenues accelerated in fiscal 2015, achieving 20% growth primarily due to increases in Sportswear, Running and Women's Training categories. Revenues in our Young Athletes' business increased 19% as a result of continued efforts to expand footwear and apparel offerings for this group across multiple categories, particularly Basketball. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  On a currency-neutral basis, revenues from NIKE, Inc. continuing operations grew 11% for fiscal 2014, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and Converse. Every NIKE Brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2014. North America contributed 5 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. revenues, while Western Europe and Emerging Markets each contributed 2 percentage points and Central  Eastern Europe and Converse each contributed 1 percentage point. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 12% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 4% during fiscal 2014. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2014 was mainly due to growth in our Basketball, Sportswear, Running and Football (Soccer) categories. Footwear unit sales in fiscal 2014 increased approximately 7% and the average selling price per pair contributed approximately 5 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven nearly equally by price increases and shifts in mix to higher-priced products. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenues for fiscal 2014 was driven by growth in all key categories, most notably our Football (Soccer), Running and Women's Training categories. In fiscal 2014, unit sales of apparel increased approximately 6% and the average selling price per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, driven by price increases and, to a lesser extent, a shift in mix to higher-priced products. For fiscal 2014, DTC revenues represented approximately 20% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 18% in fiscal 2013. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues grew 22% for fiscal 2014, as comparable store sales grew 10%, and we continued to open new stores and expand our e-commerce business. Online sales through NIKE-owned websites grew 42% in fiscal 2014. Online sales represented approximately 15% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2014 compared to 12% for fiscal 2013. On a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2014 NIKE Brand Men's revenues increased 9% mainly as a result of strong growth in our Basketball, Football (Soccer), Running and Sportswear categories. Women's revenues increased 12% in large part due to increases in our Running, Sportswear and Women's Training categories. The 16% increase in the Young Athletes' business was driven by increases in the Basketball and Football (Soccer) categories in part due to our expanded footwear and apparel offerings for this age group. Futures Orders Futures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2015 were 2% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. The U.S. Dollar futures order amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders increased 13%, with unit orders and average selling price per unit contributing approximately 8 and 5 percentage points of growth, respectively. By geography, futures orders growth was as follows:  ##TABLE_START   Reported Futures Orders  Futures Orders Excluding Currency Changes (1) North America  %  % Western Europe  %  % Central  Eastern Europe  %  % Greater China  %  % Japan  %  % Emerging Markets  %  % TOTAL NIKE BRAND FUTURES ORDERS  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Reported futures have been restated using prior year exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. ##TABLE_END The reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and at-once orders and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales of at-once and closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our DTC operations and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in Demand creation expense by approximately 4 percentage points for fiscal 2015. Operating overhead expense increased 16% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by investments in our rapidly growing DTC business, including new store openings and higher variable expenses, investments in operational infrastructure and consumer-focused digital capabilities and higher performance-based compensation. For fiscal 2015, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in Operating overhead expense by approximately 3 percentage points. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  Demand creation expense increased 10% compared to the prior year, mainly driven by marketing support for events, including the World Cup, higher sports marketing expense, key product launches and initiatives and investments to upgrade the presentation of our products in wholesale accounts. For fiscal 2014, changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on Demand creation expense . Compared to the prior year, Operating overhead expense increased 14%, primarily attributable to growth in our DTC business driven by new store openings, higher personnel costs and e-commerce launches, as well as increased investments in our digital capabilities and corporate infrastructure. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on Operating overhead expense for fiscal 2014.

Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  Other (income) expense, net shifted from $103 million of other expense, net for fiscal 2014 to $58 million of other (income), net for fiscal 2015, primarily driven by a $147 million change to net foreign currency conversion gains, primarily due to significant hedge gains from available-for-sale investments, as well as an adverse legal judgment in the prior year related to a long outstanding bankruptcy case for a former customer in Western Europe. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international business and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $73 million for fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  Other (income) expense, net shifted from $15 million  of other (income), net for fiscal 2013 to $103 million of other expense, net for fiscal 2014, primarily driven by a $90 million adverse change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses as well as an adverse legal judgment in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 related to a long outstanding bankruptcy case for a former customer in Western Europe. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $139 million for fiscal 2014.

Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  The 70 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily driven by an increase in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014, we reached a resolution with the IRS on an Advanced Pricing Agreement. This agreement did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014.

The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Companys NIKE Brand DTC operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for NIKE, Inc., and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine months in advance of the future selling season based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.

Revenue growth was driven by nearly all key categories for fiscal 2015, led by our Basketball, Sportswear and Men's and Women's Training categories. On a constant currency basis, DTC revenue grew 17% for fiscal 2015, fueled by comparable store sales growth of 8%, strong online sales growth and the addition of new stores. Footwear revenue growth was driven by increases in most key categories, notably Basketball and Sportswear. Unit sales of footwear for fiscal 2015 increased 6% and higher average selling price per pair contributed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per pair was primarily due to shifts in mix to higher-priced products, and to a lesser extent, price increases. Apparel revenue growth was attributable to strong demand in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Men's Training, Women's Training and Running, partially offset by slight declines in Football (Soccer) and Action Sports. For fiscal 2015, unit sales of apparel increased 9% and higher average selling price per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per unit was driven primarily by the favorable impact of our higher-priced DTC business, as well as shifts in mix to higher-priced products. EBIT grew 18% for fiscal 2015 as a result of higher revenues, gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 110 basis points due to shifts in mix to higher-priced products, improved off-price product margins and lower inventory obsolescence costs, partially offset by higher product input and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense decreased as a percent of revenues despite higher demand creation expense to support key brand and sporting events and higher sports marketing expense. Operating overhead costs also increased to support DTC growth and investments in infrastructure, as well as higher performance-based compensation costs. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  Our continued focus on the category offense drove increased demand for NIKE Brand products across all key categories for fiscal 2014. Our Basketball, Men's Training, Running and Sportswear categories fueled the revenue growth in fiscal 2014. DTC revenue growth in North America for fiscal 2014 was driven by a 7% increase in comparable store sales, the addition of 16 net new stores and strong online sales growth. Footwear revenue growth in North America was driven by higher demand in nearly all key categories, led by our Basketball, Running and Sportswear categories. For fiscal 2014, unit sales increased 7% and average selling price per pair contributed 4 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per pair was driven by price increases and shifts in mix toward higher-priced products in nearly equal amounts. North America apparel revenue growth was fueled by higher demand in all key categories, most notably our Men's Training, Women's Training and Sportswear categories. Unit sales increased 6% and average selling price per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per unit was primarily driven by price increases, and to a lesser extent, shifts in mix to higher-priced products. EBIT grew faster than revenues due to gross margin expansion and slight selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 120 basis points for fiscal 2014, reflecting pricing initiatives as well as lower product costs as a result of favorable changes in product mix. These gross margin benefits were partially offset by higher off-price mix. Selling and administrative expenses grew in line with revenues as a result of higher operating overhead costs to support DTC growth and higher demand creation expense in support of the World Cup and key product and brand initiatives.

Revenues grew for every key category, most notably Sportswear and Running. DTC revenues grew 40%, driven by comparable store sales growth of 24%, strong online sales growth and the addition of new stores. The constant currency footwear revenue growth was driven by increases in nearly every category, most notably Sportswear, Running and Football (Soccer). For fiscal 2015, unit sales of footwear increased 20% and average selling price per pair contributed approximately 5 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per pair was driven equally by shifts in mix to higher-priced products and the favorable impact of growth in our higher-priced DTC business. The constant currency apparel revenue growth was attributable to increases in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear, Women's Training and Running, partially offset by a slight decline in Football (Soccer) primarily due to the impact of World Cup in fiscal 2014. Unit sales of apparel in fiscal 2015 increased 14% while average selling price per unit was flat compared to the prior year. Despite the negative translation impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the Euro, reported EBIT grew 49% for fiscal 2015 as a result of strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 190 basis points, primarily due to favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher average selling prices, which were only partially offset by higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense decreased as a percent of revenues despite increases in operating overhead, primarily as a result of higher costs to support our growing DTC business. Demand creation increased largely as a result of higher sports marketing and digital demand creation costs. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  On a currency-neutral basis, all territories in Western Europe reported revenue growth for fiscal 2014, except Italy and Iberia, which declined 7% and 1%, respectively. Revenues for the U.K.  Ireland and AGS increased 20% and 23%, respectively. On a category basis, revenue growth in fiscal 2014 was fueled by our Running, Football (Soccer) and Sportswear categories. The growth in DTC revenues for fiscal 2014 was driven by 17% growth in comparable store sales, rapid growth in online sales and the addition of 19 net new stores. Constant currency footwear revenue growth in Western Europe reflected increases in every key category, most notably our Sportswear, Running, Football (Soccer) and Basketball categories. Unit sales in fiscal 2014 increased 11% and average selling price per pair contributed approximately 9 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. The increase in average price per pair was primarily the result of price increases, shifts in mix to higher-priced products and lower discounts. The constant currency increase in Western Europe apparel revenue was due to increases in Football (Soccer), Running and Women's Training, partially offset by a decline in Sportswear. Unit sales increased 3% while average selling price per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, driven primarily by lower discounts on off-price closeout sales compared to the prior year. On a reported basis, EBIT for fiscal 2014 grew at a faster rate than revenues as a result of a 150 basis point increase in gross margin and selling and administrative expense leverage. The gross margin increase was fueled by higher average selling prices, growth in our higher-margin DTC business, lower discounts and lower off-price mix, which more than offset unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product input costs. Selling and administrative expense was lower as a percent of revenue despite higher operating overhead costs to support growth in our DTC business and higher demand creation spending for sports marketing and support for key events, such as the World Cup.

DTC revenues increased 48%, driven by strong comparable store sales growth of 28%, the addition of new stores and online sales growth. The constant currency growth in footwear revenue in fiscal 2015 was driven by growth in nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear and Running. Unit sales of footwear increased 11% and increases in average selling price per pair contributed approximately 11 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per pair was driven by price increases in response to inflationary conditions in certain territories, as well as shifts in mix to higher-priced products. The constant currency growth in apparel revenue in fiscal 2015 resulted from growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear and Running, partially offset by a decline in Football (Soccer) due to comparison to strong sales related to the World Cup in fiscal 2014. Unit sales of apparel increased 1% and increases in average selling price per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per unit was primarily due to price increases in response to inflationary conditions in certain territories. On a reported basis, EBIT declined 11% for fiscal 2015, primarily reflecting the impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates. Reported revenue increases and slight selling and administrative expense leverage were more than offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin decreased 340 basis points as higher product costs and unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates were only partially offset by higher average selling prices. Selling and administrative expense decreased as a percent of revenue despite increases in both demand creation and operating overhead. Operating overhead increased primarily as a result of investments in our growing DTC business, while demand creation increased as a result of higher sports marketing costs. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  On a currency-neutral basis, Central  Eastern Europe revenues for fiscal 2014 were driven by growth across nearly all territories, particularly Russia, our largest territory, which grew 14%, and Turkey, which grew 17%.

Constant currency footwear revenue growth in fiscal 2015 was driven by increased sales in our Sportswear, Running and Basketball categories, partially offset by small declines in other categories. Unit sales of footwear increased 20% for fiscal 2015 while increases in average selling price per pair contributed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per pair was due primarily to an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business. Constant currency apparel revenue growth in fiscal 2015 was driven by increases in the Sportswear, Running and Basketball categories, partially offset by decreases in other categories, primarily Football (Soccer) and Mens Training. For fiscal 2015, unit sales of apparel increased 8% while changes in average selling price per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 1 percentage point. The decline in average selling price per unit was due primarily to shifts in mix to lower-priced products, partially offset by increased revenues from our higher-priced DTC business. On a reported basis, EBIT increased 22% for fiscal 2015 as higher revenues and gross margin expansion more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased 270 basis points primarily due to higher average selling prices and an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-margin DTC business, partially offset by higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead to support growth initiatives, primarily related to our DTC operations, as well as higher demand creation spending, primarily for sports marketing. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Greater China revenues increased 3% in fiscal 2014, primarily driven by strong growth in our DTC business, which represented 22% of total Greater China revenues for fiscal 2014. The growth in DTC revenues reflected a 20% increase in comparable store sales, the addition of 30 net new stores, as well as online sales growth. The increase in DTC revenues more than offset a 4% decrease in sales in our wholesale business as we continued to manage the amount of product sold into the market and worked with our wholesale partners to optimize product mix for the consumer. On a category basis, higher revenues in our Basketball, Sportswear and Running categories more than offset declines in Men's Training, Action Sports and Women's Training. Constant currency footwear revenue growth in fiscal 2014 was driven by increased sales in our Basketball and Sportswear categories, partially offset by declines in our Men's Training, Running and Action Sports categories. Unit sales for fiscal 2014 were flat compared to the prior year while average selling price per pair contributed approximately 5 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per pair was driven by favorable revenue mix resulting from a higher percent of sales from our higher-priced DTC business, as well as shifts in mix to higher-priced products. Constant currency apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2014 was driven by increases in the Running, Sportswear and Basketball categories, partially offset by decreases in Men's Training and Women's Training. Apparel unit sales in fiscal 2014 were 1% higher while average selling price per unit was flat. Fiscal 2014 reported EBIT was flat compared to the prior year as reported revenue and gross margin increases were offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales. Gross margin increased 150 basis points as higher average selling prices, growth in our higher-margin DTC business and improved margins on closeout sales more than offset higher product input costs and unfavorable product mix. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs driven by increased investments to support DTC growth and our new Greater China headquarters in Shanghai, as well as higher demand creation spending.

DTC revenues grew 40% in fiscal 2015 driven by a 20% increase in comparable store sales, strong online sales growth and the addition of new stores. On a reported basis, fiscal 2015 EBIT decreased 24% compared to the prior year period, reflecting the impact of the weaker Yen. Gross margin decreased 270 basis points as unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs more than offset higher average selling prices and an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-margin DTC business. Selling and administrative expense increased as a percent of revenues as higher operating overhead, primarily to support our expanding DTC business, was only partially offset by a decrease in demand creation expense. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  On a currency-neutral basis, revenues increased 5% for Japan, driven by higher revenues in Sportswear, Football (Soccer) and Basketball, partially offset by lower revenues in Men's Training and Golf. Fiscal 2014 EBIT decreased 6% as a 12% decline in reported revenues, due to the weaker Yen, was only partially offset by higher gross margin and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 20 basis points as higher average selling prices, favorable off-price mix and the favorable impact of higher-margin DTC revenues were mostly offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in selling and administrative expense in fiscal 2014 was attributable to lower operating overhead and demand creation spending.

Growth was led by one of our largest territories, SOCO (which includes Argentina, Uruguay and Chile), which grew 28%, and our Pacific territory (which includes Australia and New Zealand), which grew 26%. Revenues in our Mexico and Brazil territories decreased 21% and 3%, respectively. The decrease in Mexico was attributable to efforts to liquidate excess inventory in the marketplace largely resulting from an inconsistent flow of product to customers following distribution center transition issues in fiscal 2014, while the decrease in Brazil was primarily due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and comparison to strong sales related to the World Cup in fiscal 2014. On a category basis, revenues were higher in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running and Basketball, partially offset by a decline in Football (Soccer). DTC revenues increased 51% compared to fiscal 2014, driven by strong comparable store sales growth of 26%, the addition of new stores and online sales growth. The constant currency growth in footwear revenue for fiscal 2015 was attributable to increases in several key categories, most notably Sportswear, Basketball, Action Sports and Running. Unit sales of footwear decreased 2% while average selling price per pair contributed approximately 11 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per pair was primarily due to price increases in response to inflationary conditions in certain Latin American countries, particularly Argentina, as well as shifts in mix to higher-priced products and the favorable impact of growth in our higher-priced DTC business. Constant currency apparel revenue growth was due to increases in nearly all key categories, primarily Sportswear, Running and Women's Training, partially offset by a decline in Football (Soccer) revenues due to higher World Cup sales in fiscal 2014. Unit sales of apparel decreased 1% while average selling price per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per unit was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from our higher-priced DTC business, and to a lesser extent, price increases in response to inflationary conditions. On a reported basis, EBIT decreased 14% primarily due to reported revenue declines, lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense, as well as the impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates . Gross margin decreased 140 basis points due to unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, higher inventory obsolescence and higher off-price mix, partially offset by higher average selling prices. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs, primarily to support DTC growth, as well as higher demand creation expense, in part as a result of support for the World Cup in early fiscal 2015 and higher sports marketing expense. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2014 revenues for Emerging Markets increased 13% as a result of growth across nearly every territory. Our largest territory, Brazil, grew 19%, while our SOCO territory grew 25%. Mexico revenues decreased 3% largely as a result of shipping delays caused by issues with a distribution center transition in the first half of fiscal 2014. On a category basis, revenues were higher in nearly every category, led by Football (Soccer), Running and Sportswear. Constant currency footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2014 was driven by growth in nearly every key category, led by Running, Sportswear, Football (Soccer) and Action Sports. Unit sales for fiscal 2014 increased 4% and average selling price per pair contributed approximately 6 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per pair was primarily driven by price increases, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain Latin American territories, and to a lesser extent, shifts in mix to higher-priced products. Constant currency apparel revenue increased driven by growth in every key category, most notably Football (Soccer) and Running. Unit sales increased 11% and average selling price per unit contributed approximately 10 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to price increases, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain Latin American territories. Fiscal 2014 reported EBIT decreased primarily due to a decline in gross margin, higher selling and administrative expense and weaker currencies in a number of developing markets. Gross margin decreased 30 basis points due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, higher product costs, higher warehousing costs related to distribution center transition challenges in Mexico and higher discounts, which more than offset higher average selling prices. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion of our DTC business and infrastructure investments to support growth, as well as increases in demand creation spending to support the World Cup and key product launches.

Revenues for Global Brand Divisions are primarily attributable to NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes increased $270 million in fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher operating overhead reflecting continued investments in operational infrastructure, including digital capabilities, consumer engagement and supply chain initiatives, as well as higher performance-based compensation. Demand creation expense increased slightly due to support for the World Cup in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and key brand and consumer events. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  For fiscal 2014, Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes increased $277 million, primarily driven by an increase in centrally managed product costs, increased investments in our digital infrastructure, as well as higher demand creation spending in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to support the World Cup and product creation and design initiatives.

The largest direct distribution markets are the United States, the United Kingdom and China. Converse does not own the Converse trademarks in Japan. Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalties to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Converse increased 21% for fiscal 2015. Comparable direct distribution markets (i.e., markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years) grew 14%, contributing 12 percentage points of total revenue growth for fiscal 2015. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 12% and average selling price per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of Converse comparable direct distribution market revenue growth. The United States market was the most significant contributor to the growth of comparable direct distribution markets due to volume increases with key wholesale customers and expansion of our DTC business. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution contributed 8 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2015, driven by conversion of several European markets, most significantly AGS (Austria, Germany and Switzerland). Revenues from comparable licensed markets increased 8% for fiscal 2015, contributing 1 percentage point of total Converse revenue growth. EBIT for Converse increased 4% for fiscal 2015 as strong revenue growth was partially offset by lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin decreased 60 basis points primarily due to transitions of licensed markets to direct distribution markets. Selling and administrative expense increased for fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher operating overhead costs resulting from investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth, including market transitions, new systems and new headquarters, as well as higher intellectual property enforcement costs. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Converse increased 15% for fiscal 2014. Comparable direct distribution markets grew 13%, contributing 10 percentage points of total revenue growth for fiscal 2014, primarily due to strength in our United States, China and United Kingdom markets. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 12% and average selling price per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of Converse comparable direct distribution market revenue growth. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution contributed 4 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2014. Revenues from comparable licensed markets increased 8% for fiscal 2014, contributing 1 percentage point of total Converse revenue growth. On a reported basis, EBIT at Converse grew 17% for fiscal 2014 as higher revenues and gross margin were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased 80 basis points, primarily due to growth in higher-margin territories and products within our direct distribution markets. Selling and administrative expense grew faster than revenue for fiscal 2014 due to higher operating overhead to support growth initiatives and DTC expansion, as well as higher demand creation spending.

The Corporate loss before interest and taxes consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses. In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  For fiscal 2015, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased $65 million primarily due to the following: ##TABLE_START  a $211 million increase in corporate overhead expense related to corporate initiatives to support growth of the business as well as performance-based compensation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $144 million beneficial change from net foreign currency losses to net foreign currency gains, reported as a component of Other (income) expense, net ; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  an approximate $2 million increase in foreign exchange losses related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains; these losses are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin. ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  For fiscal 2014, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased by $127 million primarily due to the following: ##TABLE_START  a $101 million increase in corporate overhead expense related to corporate initiatives to support the growth of the business as well as performance-based compensation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $90 million increase in net foreign currency losses, reported as a component of Other (income) expense, net ; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $ 56 million decrease in foreign exchange losses related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains; these losses are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices ##TABLE_ENDOverview As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (\"NTC\") and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Transactional Exposures We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: ##TABLE_START  Product Costs  NIKEs product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START a. Certain NIKE entities, including those supporting our North America, Greater China, Japan and European geographies, purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. ##TABLE_END In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost. ##TABLE_START 2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. ##TABLE_END For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net . Refer to Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthe ning U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKEs U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost. ##TABLE_START  Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales  A portion of our Western Europe and Central  Eastern Europe geography revenues, as well as a portion of our Converse European operations revenues, are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Costs  Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has also entered into other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to foreign currencies and create embedded derivative contracts that are recorded at fair value through  Other (income) expense, net . Refer to Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities  Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations. ##TABLE_END Managing Transactional Exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost purchase exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements and Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end. Translational Exposures Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $1,171 million and $288 million for the years ended May 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $221 million and $49 million for the years ended May 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Managing Translational Exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements and Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end. We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $73 million and $139 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Net Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for net investment hedges. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2015 and 2014. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2015 and 2014. ##TABLE_START Liquidity and Capital Resources ##TABLE_ENDCash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $4,680 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $3,013 million for fiscal 2014 . Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2015 was Net income of $3,273 million . Our fiscal 2015 change in working capital was a net cash inflow of $256 million as compared to a net cash outflow of $488 million for fiscal 2014 . Our investments in working capital decreased due to increases in Accrued liabilities , primarily resulting from the receipt of $968 million of cash collateral from counterparties as a result of hedging activity. These amounts were partially offset by higher inventory levels resulting from business growth and West Coast port delays in North America, as well as lower Income taxes payable as a result of tax payments made in fiscal 2015 following the U.S. Unilateral Advance Pricing Agreement reached with the IRS in fiscal 2014. Cash used by investing activities was $175 million for fiscal 2015 , compared to a $1,207 million use of cash for fiscal 2014 . The primary driver of the decrease in Cash used by investing activities was the net change in short-term investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) from net purchases to net sales/maturities. In fiscal 2015, there were $935 million of net sales/maturities compared to $328 million of net purchases of short-term investments in the same period of fiscal 2014. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $963 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to $880 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in Additions to property, plant and equipment resulted from continued investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth, primarily relating to expansion of our DTC operations as well as supply chain and corporate initiatives. In fiscal 2016, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, as well as expand our digital capabilities. We anticipate investing approximately 4% of revenue, a portion of which will be used for the continued expansion of our corporate facilities, new DTC stores and digital capabilities. Cash used by financing activities was $2,790 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $2,914 million for fiscal 2014 , a decrease of $124 million, as increased dividends were more than offset by an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. In fiscal 2015 , we purchased 29.0 million shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock for $2,534 million , an average price of $ 87.37 . During fiscal 2013, we completed the four-year, $5 billion share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2008. Under that program, we purchased a total of 118.8 million shares at an average price of $42.08. Subsequently, we began repurchases under a four-year, $8 billion program approved by the Board in September 2012. As of the end of fiscal 2015 , we had repurchased 80.9 million shares at an average price of $73.55 for a total cost of $5,950 million under this current program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Capital Resources On April 23, 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement (the \"Shelf\") with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities. The Shelf expires on April 23, 2016. On April 23, 2013, we issued $1.0 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043. The 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 2.25% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2023. The 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.625% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2043. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of $998 million. On November 1, 2011, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with lender approval. The facility matures November 1, 2017. As of and for the periods ended May 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had no amounts outstanding under our committed credit facility. We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2015 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. During the year ended May 31, 2015 , we did not issue commercial paper, and as of May 31, 2015 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this program. We may issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2016 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. As of May 31, 2015 , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $5.9 billion , of which $4.2 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Included in Cash and equivalents as of May 31, 2015 was $968 million of cash collateral received from counterparties as a result of hedging activity. Cash equivalents and Short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2015 the weighted average remaining duration of our short-term investments and cash equivalents portfolio was 79 days. To date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the United States through debt, we would incur additional interest expense . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2015 and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows: ##TABLE_START Description of Commitment  Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, (In millions)       Thereafter  Total Operating Leases  $  $  $  $  $  $ 1,154  $ 2,974 Capital Leases           Long-term Debt (1)       1,451  1,797 Endorsement Contracts (2)  1,009      2,143  6,192 Product Purchase Obligations (3)  3,735            3,735 Other (4)        TOTAL  $ 5,678  $ 1,573  $ 1,384  $ 1,125  $  $ 4,840  $ 15,473 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2015 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. ##TABLE_END In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. ##TABLE_START (3) We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2015 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in Accounts payable or Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2015 . ##TABLE_END The total liability for uncertain tax positions was $438 million , excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2015 . We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2015 . Refer to Note 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. ##TABLE_START (In millions) Outstanding as of May 31, 2015 Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand $ Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2015 , the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling $165 million . These letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Companys performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. ##TABLE_START Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ##TABLE_ENDIn July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update intended to provide guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits, reflecting the manner in which an entity would settle, at the reporting date, any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position when net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses or tax credit carryforwards exist. This accounting standard was effective for us beginning June 1, 2014 and early adoption was permitted. We early adopted this guidance and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In July 2012, the FASB issued an accounting standards update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. This accounting standard update was effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entitys right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. This new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements. This new guidance was effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. ##TABLE_START Recently Issued Accounting Standards ##TABLE_ENDIn May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. The updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Based on the FASB's decision in July 2015 to defer the effective date and to allow more flexibility with implementation, we anticipate the new standard will be effective for us beginning June 1, 2018. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. ##TABLE_START Critical Accounting Policies ##TABLE_ENDOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and online store revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the United States, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales . If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to Cost of sales . Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are recorded in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance, increased or decreased Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the assets net book value to its salvage value. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. We may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any. We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Fair Value Measurements For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, including U.S. Treasury securities. In the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as time deposits, commercial paper and bonds, U.S. Agency securities and money market funds. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our available-for-sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include a comparison to another independent pricing vendor. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Other comprehensive income , rather than Net income , until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income . In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Other comprehensive income into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Other comprehensive income to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. We have, in the past, used and may, in the future use, forward contracts or options to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the forward contracts or options hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income within Total shareholders equity , to the extent effective, to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported as Other (income) expense, net during the period in which changes occur. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Income Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, thus reducing our overall Income tax expense . The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional Income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our Income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense . The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense . Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding, or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and options contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may, in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2015 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. See section Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices under Item 7 for additional detail. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, fixed-rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixed-rate debt as well as pay-fixed, receive-variable forward-starting interest rate swaps for cash outflows of interest payments on future debt. ##TABLE_START Market Risk Measurement ##TABLE_ENDWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (VaR). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $117 million and $50 million at May 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-year as a result of an increase in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio, a longer weighted average duration on our outstanding trades and an increase in foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2015. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $205 million and $70 million during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows. During the year ended May 31, 2015, we entered into a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements. A forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. We entered into these forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuance of debt. These instruments were designated as cash flow hedges of the variability in the expected cash outflows of interest payments on future debt due to changes in benchmark interest rates. Details of third-party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.

The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles we considered appropriate in the circumstances and include some amounts based on our best estimates and judgments. Other financial information in this report is consistent with these financial statements. Our accounting systems include controls designed to reasonably assure assets are safeguarded from unauthorized use or disposition and provide for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These systems are supplemented by the selection and training of qualified financial personnel and an organizational structure providing for appropriate segregation of duties. An internal Corporate Audit department reviews the results of its work with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, presently consisting of four outside directors. The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews, with the independent registered public accounting firm, management and the internal audit staff, the scope and the results of the annual examination, the effectiveness of the accounting control system and other matters relating to the financial affairs of NIKE as the Audit Committee deems appropriate. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have full access to the Committee, with and without the presence of management, to discuss any appropriate matters. ##TABLE_START Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting ##TABLE_ENDManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(f) and Rule 15(d) - 15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect on the financial statements. While reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, it does not mean absolute assurance. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatement and instance of fraud. Controls are susceptible to manipulation, especially in instances of fraud caused by the collusion of two or more people, including our senior management. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2015 . PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited (1) the Consolidated Financial Statements and (2) the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2015 , as stated in their report herein. ##TABLE_START Mark G. Parker Donald W. Blair President and Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ##TABLE_ENDTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NIKE, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries at May 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /S/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP Portland, Oregon July 23, 2015   ##TABLE_START NIKE, Inc.

NIKE, Inc. portfolio brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse. The NIKE Brand is focused on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services across a wide range of sport categories, amplified with sport-inspired sportswear products carrying the Swoosh trademark as well as other NIKE Brand trademarks. The Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories, using the Jumpman trademark. Sales of Jordan Brand products are included within the NIKE Brand Basketball category. The Hurley brand is focused on surf and action sports and youth lifestyle footwear, apparel and accessories, using the Hurley trademark. Sales of Hurley brand products are included within the NIKE Brand Action Sports category. Converse designs, distributes, markets and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis. Basis of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company completed the sale of Cole Haan during the third quarter ended February 28, 2013 and completed the sale of Umbro during the second quarter ended November 30, 2012. As a result, the Company reports the operating results of Cole Haan and Umbro in the Net income from discontinued operations line in the Consolidated Statements of Income for all applicable periods presented. There were no assets or liabilities of discontinued operations as of May 31, 2015 and May 31, 2014 (refer to Note 15  Discontinued Operations ). Unless otherwise indicated, the disclosures accompanying the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the Companys continuing operations. On November 15, 2012, the Company announced a two -for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common shares. The stock split was a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 24, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 10, 2012. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 26, 2012. All share numbers and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2015 presentation. Revisions During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, management determined it had incorrectly reflected unrealized gains and losses from re-measurement of non-functional currency intercompany balances between certain of its foreign wholly-owned subsidiaries in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These unrealized gains and losses should have been classified as non-cash reconciling items from Net income to Cash provided by operations , but were instead reported on the Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents line of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This resulted in an understatement of Cash provided by operations reported on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for certain prior periods; there was no impact for any period to Net increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents reported on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, or Cash and equivalents reported on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Balance Sheets. The Company assessed the materiality of the misclassifications on prior periods' financial statements in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 99, Materiality, codified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 250, Presentation of Financial Statements, and concluded that these misstatements were not material to any prior annual or interim periods. Accordingly, in accordance with ASC 250 (SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements), the amounts have been revised in the applicable Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the three and six months ended August 31, 2014 and November 30, 2014 of fiscal 2015, the revisions increased Cash provided by operations and decreased Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents by $95 million and $312 million , respectively. For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013, the revisions increased Cash provided by operations and decreased Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents by $10 million and $64 million , respectively. These amounts have been reflected in the applicable tables below. As part of the revision to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company has updated its presentation to separately report Net foreign currency adjustments , which was previously included within Amortization and other .

This occurs upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and online store revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims from customers are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale. Post-invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. Estimates of discretionary discounts, returns and claims are based on historical rates, specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and estimated discounts, returns and claims expected, but not yet finalized with customers. As of May 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Companys reserve balances for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims were $724 million and $610 million , respectively. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and research, design and development costs. Shipping and Handling Costs Outbound shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales . Operating Overhead Expense Operating overhead expense consists primarily of payroll and benefit related costs, rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services and meetings and travel. Demand Creation Expense Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, television, digital and print advertising, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run. Advertising communication costs are expensed when the advertisement appears. Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is completed and delivered. A significant amount of the Companys promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. Accounting for endorsement payments is based upon specific contract provisions. Generally, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract after giving recognition to periodic performance compliance provisions of the contracts. Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). The Company records demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When the Company determines payments are probable, the amounts are reported in demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from the Company's estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance, increased or decreased demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. The Company expenses these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, the Company offers minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which the Company estimates it will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, the Company records the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the guarantee period. Through cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses retail customers for certain costs of advertising the Companys products. The Company records these costs in Demand creation expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs. This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run. Total advertising and promotion expenses were $3,213 million , $3,031 million and $2,745 million for the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses totaled $455 million and $516 million at May 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and were recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, money market funds, time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. Short-Term Investments Short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency and corporate debt securities, with maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase. Debt securities that the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At May 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company did not hold any short-term investments that were classified as trading or held-to-maturity. At May 31, 2015 and 2014 , Short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Other comprehensive income , unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at the date of purchase as current assets within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Companys short-term investments. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts receivable from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets . The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $78 million and $78 million at May 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, of which $24 million and $37 million , respectively, was classified as long-term and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets . Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and valued on either an average or specific identification cost basis. For inventories in transit that represent direct shipments to customers, the related inventory and cost of sales are recognized on a specific identification basis. Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Company's suppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance and logistics and other handling fees. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years. Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales . Depreciation and amortization of other assets are recorded in Total selling and administrative expense . Software Development Costs Internal Use Software . Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 10 year period on a straight-line basis. The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed . Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test first requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the Company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, the Company measures and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any. The Company generally bases its measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that the Company expects the reporting unit to generate in the future. The Company's significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: its weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the C ompany determines that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, the Company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Operating Leases The Company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space and other non-real estate assets under operating leases. Operating lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. Rent expense for non-cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, beginning with the effective lease commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Certain leases also provide for contingent rents, which are determined as a percent of sales in excess of specified levels. A contingent rent liability is recognized together with the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable. Fair Value Measurements The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives and available-for-sale securities. Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach). The levels of hierarchy are described below: ##TABLE_START  Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. ##TABLE_END The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Pricing vendors are utilized for certain Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and that of its counterparties. The Companys fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include a comparison of fair values to another independent pricing vendor. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for additional information. Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactions Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in Total shareholders equity . The Companys global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, the impact of which is recorded in Other (income) expense, net , within the Consolidated Statements of Income. Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (a component of Total shareholders equity ), Long-term debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For designated net investment hedges, this is within the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. For the Companys fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Refer to Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives. Stock-Based Compensation The Company estimates the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted under the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1990 Plan) and employees purchase rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes this fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as Operating overhead expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the vesting period using the straight-line method. Refer to Note 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for more information on the Companys stock programs. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. United States income taxes are provided currently on financial statement earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are expected to be repatriated. The Company determines annually the amount of undistributed non-U.S. earnings to invest indefinitely in its non-U.S. operations. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense . Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes for further discussion. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards. Refer to Note 12  Earnings Per Share for further discussion. Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In July 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standards update intended to provide guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits, reflecting the manner in which an entity would settle, at the reporting date, any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position when net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses or tax credit carryforwards exist. This accounting standard was effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2014 and early adoption was permitted. Management early adopted this guidance and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. In July 2012, the FASB issued an accounting standards update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. This accounting standards update was effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2013. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entitys right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. This new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements. This new guidance was effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. The updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Based on the FASB's decision in July 2015 to defer the effective date and to allow more flexibility with implementation, the Company anticipates the new standard will be effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_START NOTE 2  Inventories ##TABLE_ENDInventory balances of $4,337 million and $3,947 million at May 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, were substantially all finished goods. ##TABLE_START NOTE 3  Property, Plant and Equipment ##TABLE_ENDProperty, plant and equipment, net included the following: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   Land  $  $ Buildings  1,250  1,261 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software  3,329  3,376 Leasehold improvements  1,150  1,066 Construction in process   Total property, plant and equipment, gross  6,352  6,220 Less accumulated depreciation  3,341  3,386 TOTAL PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET  $ 3,011  $ 2,834 ##TABLE_ENDCapitalized interest was not material for the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .

During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015, the Company restructured the terms of certain capital leases, which now qualify as operating leases. ##TABLE_START NOTE 4  Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill ##TABLE_ENDIdentifiable intangible assets, net consists of indefinite-lived trademarks, which are not subject to amortization, and acquired trademarks and other intangible assets, which are subject to amortization. At May 31, 2015 and 2014, indefinite-lived trademarks were $281 million and $282 million , respectively. Acquired trademarks and other intangible assets at May 31, 2015 and 2014 were $17 million and $39 million , respectively, and were fully amortized at the end of both periods. Goodwill was $131 million at May 31, 2015 and 2014 of which $65 million and $64 million were included in the Converse segment in the respective periods. The remaining amounts were included in Global Brand Divisions for segment reporting purposes. There were no accumulated impairment balances for goodwill as of either period end. ##TABLE_START NOTE 5  Accrued Liabilities ##TABLE_ENDAccrued liabilities included the following: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   Compensation and benefits, excluding taxes  $  $ Collateral received from counterparties to hedging instruments    Endorsement compensation   Dividends payable   Import and logistics costs   Taxes other than income taxes   Fair value of derivatives   Advertising and marketing   Other (1)   TOTAL ACCRUED LIABILITIES  $ 3,951  $ 2,491 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Other consists of various accrued expenses with no individual item accounting for more than 5% of the total Accrued liabilities balance at May 31, 2015 and 2014 . ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START NOTE 6  Fair Value Measurements ##TABLE_ENDThe following tables present information about the Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of May 31, 2015 and 2014 and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value.

The Companys derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements that allow for the offset of assets and liabilities in the event of default or early termination of the contract. Any amounts of cash collateral received related to these instruments associated with the Company's credit-related contingent features are recorded in Cash and equivalents and Accrued liabilities , the latter of which would further offset against the Companys derivative asset balance (refer to Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives ). Cash collateral received related to the Company's credit related contingent features is presented in the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Any amounts of non-cash collateral received, such as securities, are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets pursuant to the accounting standards for non-cash collateral received. The following tables present information about the Companys derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of May 31, 2015 and May 31, 2014 , and indicate the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the Company classifies the fair value measurement. ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, 2015   Derivative Assets  Derivative Liabilities (In millions)  Assets at Fair Value  Other Current Assets  Other Long-term Assets  Liabilities at Fair Value  Accrued Liabilities  Other Long-term Liabilities Level 2:             Foreign exchange forwards and options (1)  $ 1,554  $ 1,034  $  $  $  $ Embedded derivatives       Interest rate swaps (2)           TOTAL  $ 1,639  $ 1,114  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) If the foreign exchange derivative instruments had been netted in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the asset and liability positions each would have been reduced by $161 million as of May 31, 2015 . As of that date, the Company had received $900 million of cash collateral and $74 million of securities from various counterparties related to these foreign exchange derivative instruments. No amount of collateral was posted on the Companys derivative liability balance as of May 31, 2015 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) As of May 31, 2015 , the Company had received $68 million of cash collateral related to its interest rate swaps. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, 2014   Derivative Assets  Derivative Liabilities (In millions)  Assets at Fair Value  Other Current Assets  Other Long-term Assets  Liabilities at Fair Value  Accrued Liabilities  Other Long-term Liabilities Level 2:             Foreign exchange forwards and options (1)  $  $  $  $  $  $ Interest rate swaps           TOTAL  $  $  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) If the foreign exchange derivative financial instruments had been netted in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the asset and liability positions each would have been reduced by $63 million as of May 31, 2014 . No amounts of collateral were received or posted on the Companys derivative assets and liabilities as of May 31, 2014 . ##TABLE_END Available-for-sale securities comprise investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, money market funds, corporate commercial paper and bonds. These securities are valued using market prices on both active markets (Level 1) and less active markets (Level 2). The gross realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities were immaterial for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2015 and 2014 . Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities included in Other comprehensive income were immaterial as of May 31, 2015 and 2014 . The Company regularly reviews its available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment. For the years ended May 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company did not consider its securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired and accordingly, did not recognize any impairment losses. As of May 31, 2015 , the Company held $1,808 million of available-for-sale securities with maturity dates within one year and $264 million with maturity dates over one year and less than five years within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Included in Interest expense (income), net was interest income related to the Company's available-for-sale securities of $6 million , $5 million and $4 million for the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The Companys Level 3 assets comprise investments in certain non-marketable preferred stock. These Level 3 investments are an immaterial portion of the Company's portfolio. Changes in Level 3 investment assets were immaterial during the years ended May 31, 2015 and 2014 . Derivative financial instruments include foreign exchange forwards and options, embedded derivatives and interest rate swaps. Refer to Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives for additional detail. No transfers among the levels within the fair value hierarchy occurred during the years ended May 31, 2015 or 2014 . As of May 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company had no assets or liabilities that were required to be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. For fair value information regarding Notes payable and Long-term debt , refer to Note 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines and Note 8  Long-Term Debt . At May 31, 2015 , the Company had $150 million of outstanding receivables related to its investments in reverse repurchase agreements recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The carrying amount of these agreements approximates their fair value based upon observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2). The reverse repurchase agreements are fully collateralized. ##TABLE_START NOTE 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines ##TABLE_ENDNotes payable and interest-bearing accounts payable to Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America) as of May 31, 2015 and 2014 are summarized below: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31,     (Dollars in millions)  Borrowings  Interest Rate  Borrowings  Interest Rate Notes payable:           U.S. operations  $   0.00 % (1)   $   0.00 % (1)  Non-U.S. operations   12.39 % (1)    10.04 % (1)  TOTAL NOTES PAYABLE  $     $    Interest-bearing accounts payable:           Sojitz America  $  0.98 %   $  0.94 %  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Weighted average interest rate includes non-interest bearing overdrafts. ##TABLE_END The carrying amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for Notes payable approximate fair value. The Company purchases through Sojitz America certain NIKE Brand products it acquires from non-U.S. suppliers. These purchases are for products sold in certain countries in the Company's Emerging Markets geographic operating segment and Canada, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Accounts payable to Sojitz America are generally due up to 60 days after shipment of goods from the foreign port. The interest rate on such accounts payable is the 60 -day London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as of the beginning of the month of the invoice date, plus 0.75% . As of May 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company had no amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program. On November 1, 2011, the Company entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with lender approval. Following an extension agreement on September 17, 2013 between the Company and the syndicate of banks, the facility matures November 1, 2017. Based on the Companys current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.445% . The facility fee is 0.055% of the total commitment. Under this committed credit facility, the Company must maintain, among other things, certain minimum specified financial ratios with which the Company was in compliance at May 31, 2015 . No amounts were outstanding under this facility as of May 31, 2015 or 2014 . ##TABLE_START NOTE 8  Long-Term Debt ##TABLE_ENDLong-term debt , net of unamortized premiums and discounts and swap fair value adjustments, comprises the following : ##TABLE_START         Book Value Outstanding As of May 31, Scheduled Maturity (Dollars and Yen in millions)  Original Principal  Interest Rate  Interest Payments   Corporate Bond Payables: (4)           October 15, 2015 (1)  $  5.15 %  Semi-Annually  $  $ May 1, 2023 (5)  $  2.25 %  Semi-Annually   May 1, 2043 (5)  $  3.63 %  Semi-Annually   Promissory Notes:           April 1, 2017 (2)  $  6.20 %  Monthly   January 1, 2018 (2)  $  6.79 %  Monthly   Japanese Yen Notes:           August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020 (3)   9,000  2.60 %  Quarterly   August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020 (3)   4,000  2.00 %  Quarterly   Total        1,186  1,206 Less current maturities         TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT        $ 1,079  $ 1,199 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby the Company receives fixed interest payments at the same rate as the note and pays variable interest payments based on the six -month LIBOR plus a spread. The swaps have the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding note. At May 31, 2015 , the interest rates payable on these swap agreements ranged from approximately 0.3% to 0.5% . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) The Company assumed a total of $59 million in bonds payable as part of its agreement to purchase certain Corporate properties; this was treated as a non-cash financing transaction. The property serves as collateral for the debt. The purchase of these properties was accounted for as a business combination where the total consideration of $85 million was allocated to the land and buildings acquired; no other tangible or intangible assets or liabilities resulted from the purchase. The bonds mature in 2017 and 2018 and the Company does not have the ability to re-negotiate the terms of the debt agreements and would incur significant financial penalties if the notes were paid-off prior to maturity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) NIKE Logistics YK assumed a total of 13.0 billion in loans as part of its agreement to purchase a distribution center in Japan, which serves as collateral for the loans. These loans mature in equal quarterly installments during the period August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) These senior unsecured obligations rank equally with the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) The bonds are redeemable at the Company's option prior to February 1, 2023 and November 1, 2042, respectively, at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. Subsequent to February 1, 2023 and November 1, 2042, respectively, the bonds also feature a par call provision, which allows for the bonds to be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. ##TABLE_END The scheduled maturity of Long-term debt in each of the years ending May 31, 2016 through 2020 are $106 million , $44 million , $24 million , $6 million and $6 million , respectively, at face value. The fair value of the Companys Long-term debt , including the current portion, was approximately $1,160 million at May 31, 2015 and $1,154 million at May 31, 2014 . The fair value of Long-term debt is estimated based upon quoted prices of similar instruments (level 2). ##TABLE_START NOTE 9  Income Taxes ##TABLE_ENDIncome before income taxes is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Income before income taxes:       United States  $ 1,967  $ 3,066  $ 1,231 Foreign  2,238   2,025 TOTAL INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  $ 4,205  $ 3,544  $ 3,256 ##TABLE_ENDThe provision for income taxes is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Current:       United States       Federal  $  $  $ State    Foreign    Total  1,045   Deferred:       United States       Federal  (66 )   (4 ) State  (11 )  (3 )  (4 ) Foreign  (36 )  (27 )  (86 ) Total  (113 )  (11 )  (94 ) TOTAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDA reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,     Federal income tax rate  35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % State taxes, net of federal benefit  0.9 %  1.8 %  1.4 % Foreign earnings  -15.7 %  2.2 %  -11.8 % Deferred charge  0.9 %  -14.6 %  0.0 % Other, net  1.1 %  -0.4 %  0.1 % EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE  22.2 %  24.0 %  24.7 % ##TABLE_ENDThe effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended May 31, 2015 was 180 basis points lower than the effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended May 31, 2014 primarily due to the favorable resolution of audits in several jurisdictions. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended May 31, 2014 was 70 basis points lower than the effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended May 31, 2013 primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings from lower tax rate jurisdictions. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014 , the Company reached a resolution with the IRS on a U.S. Unilateral Advanced Pricing Agreement that covers intercompany transfer pricing for fiscal years 2011 through 2020. This agreement resulted in an increase in the effective tax rate due to a reduction in the Companys permanently reinvested foreign  earnings, which was partially offset by a reduction in previously unrecognized tax benefits. It also resulted in a decrease in the  effective tax rate due to the recognition of a deferred tax charge. The net result of the agreement did not have a material impact on the Companys effective income tax rate in fiscal 2014. Deferred tax assets and (liabilities) comprise the following:  ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   Deferred tax assets:     Allowance for doubtful accounts  $  $ Inventories   Sales return reserves   Deferred compensation   Stock-based compensation   Reserves and accrued liabilities   Net operating loss carry-forwards   Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries   Other   Total deferred tax assets   Valuation allowance  (9 )  (9 ) Total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance   Deferred tax liabilities:     Property, plant and equipment  (220 )  (237 ) Intangibles  (93 )  (94 ) Other  (38 )  (2 ) Total deferred tax liability  (351 )  (333 ) NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe following is a reconciliation of the changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)    Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of the period  $  $  $ Gross increases related to prior period tax positions (1)    Gross decreases related to prior period tax positions (1)  (123 )  (166 )  (3 ) Gross increases related to current period tax positions    Gross decreases related to current period tax positions  (9 )  (30 )  (9 ) Settlements (1)  (27 )  (676 )   Lapse of statute of limitations  (10 )  (4 )  (21 ) Changes due to currency translation  (13 )  (4 )  (12 ) UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, END OF THE PERIOD  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014 , the Company reached a resolution with the IRS on a U.S. Unilateral Advanced Pricing Agreement that covers intercompany transfer pricing for fiscal years 2011 through 2020. As a result, the Company recorded a gross increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior period tax positions, a gross decrease in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior period tax positions and a settlement. The net impact of these items resulted in a decrease to unrecognized tax benefits. ##TABLE_END As of May 31, 2015 , total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were $438 million , $260 million of which would affect the Company's effective tax rate if recognized in future periods. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense . The liability for payment of interest and penalties decreased $3 million during the year ended May 31, 2015 , and increased $55 million and $4 million during the years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. As of May 31, 2015 and 2014 , accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $164 million and $167 million , respectively (excluding federal benefit). The Company incurs tax liabilities primarily in the United States, China and the Netherlands, as well as various state and other foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the 2012 through 2014 tax years. The Company has closed all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2011, with the exception of the validation of foreign tax credits utilized. As previously disclosed, the Company received a statutory notice of deficiency for fiscal 2011 proposing an increase in tax of $31 million , subject to interest, related to the foreign tax credit matter. This notice also reported a decrease in foreign tax credit carryovers for fiscal 2010 and 2011. The Company has contested this deficiency notice by filing a petition with the U.S Tax Court in April 2015. The Company does not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material impact on the financial statements. No payments on the assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved. Based on the information currently available, the Company does not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to its unrecognized tax benefits for this matter within the next 12 months. The Companys major foreign jurisdictions, China, the Netherlands and Brazil, have concluded substantially all income tax matters through calendar 2005, fiscal 2009 and calendar 2008, respectively. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in the aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $63 million within the next 12 months. The Company provides for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At May 31, 2015 , the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes have not been provided were approximately $8.3 billion . If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences of undistributed earnings would be approximately $2.7 billion at May 31, 2015 . A portion of the Company's foreign operations are benefiting from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2021 . This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The impact of this tax holiday decreased foreign taxes by $174 million , $138 million and $108 million for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on diluted earnings per common share was $0.20 , $0.15 and $0.12 for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Deferred tax assets at May 31, 2015 and 2014 were reduced by a valuation allowance relating to tax benefits of certain subsidiaries with operating losses. There was no net change in the valuation allowance for the year ended May 31, 2015 compared to a net increase of $4 million and a net decrease of $22 million for the years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of $36 million at May 31, 2015 . Such losses will expire as follows:  ##TABLE_START   Year Ending May 31, (In millions)      2020-2035  Indefinite  Total Net operating losses  $   $   $  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDDuring the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , income tax benefits attributable to employee stock-based compensation transactions of $224 million , $135 million and $76 million , respectively, were allocated to Total shareholders equity . ##TABLE_START NOTE 10  Redeemable Preferred Stock ##TABLE_ENDSojitz America is the sole owner of the Companys authorized redeemable preferred stock, $1 par value, which is redeemable at the option of Sojitz America or the Company at par value aggregating $0.3 million . A cumulative dividend of $0.10 per share is payable annually on May 31 and no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock of the Company unless dividends on the redeemable preferred stock have been declared and paid in full. There have been no changes in the redeemable preferred stock in the three years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . As the holder of the redeemable preferred stock, Sojitz America does not have general voting rights, but does have the right to vote as a separate class on the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, on merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company or on the sale or assignment of the NIKE trademark for athletic footwear sold in the United States. The redeemable preferred stock has been fully issued to Sojitz America and is not blank check preferred stock. The Company's articles of incorporation do not permit the issuance of additional preferred stock. ##TABLE_START NOTE 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation ##TABLE_ENDThe authorized number of shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value, and Class B Common Stock, no par value, are 200 million and 1,200 million , respectively. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors. There are no differences in the dividend and liquidation preferences or participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shareholders. In 1990, the Board of Directors adopted, and the shareholders approved, the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1990 Plan). The 1990 Plan, as amended, provides for the issuance of up to 326 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with stock options and other awards granted under the plan. The 1990 Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance-based awards. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the 1990 Plan. The committee has the authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards and the other terms and conditions of the awards. Substantially all stock option grants outstanding under the 1990 Plan were granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year, vest ratably over four years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. The following table summarizes the Companys total stock-based compensation expense recognized in Operating overhead expense :  ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Stock options (1)  $  $  $ ESPPs    Restricted stock    TOTAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Expense for stock options includes the expense associated with stock appreciation rights. Accelerated stock option expense is recorded for employees eligible for accelerated stock option vesting upon retirement. Accelerated stock option expense for the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $19 million , $15 million and $22 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END As of May 31, 2015 , the Company had $180 million of unrecognized compensation costs from stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, to be recognized in Operating overhead expense over a weighted average period of 1.9 years. The weighted average fair value per share of the options granted during the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , as computed using the Black-Scholes pricing model, was $16.95 , $14.89 and $12.71 , respectively. The weighted average assumptions used to estimate these fair values are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,     Dividend yield  1.2 %  1.3 %  1.5 % Expected volatility  23.6 %  27.9 %  35.0 % Weighted average expected life (in years)  5.8  5.3  5.3 Risk-free interest rate  1.7 %  1.3 %  0.6 % ##TABLE_ENDThe Company estimates the expected volatility based on the implied volatility in market traded options on the Companys common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. The weighted average expected life of options is based on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns. The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rate in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the options. The following summarizes the stock option transactions under the plan discussed above:  ##TABLE_START   Shares (1)  Weighted Average Option Price   (In millions)   Options outstanding May 31, 2012  64.3  $ 30.59 Exercised  (9.9 )  24.70 Forfeited  (1.3 )  40.14 Granted  14.6  46.55 Options outstanding May 31, 2013  67.7  $ 34.72 Exercised  (11.0 )  28.29 Forfeited  (1.3 )  48.33 Granted  8.1  63.54 Options outstanding May 31, 2014  63.5  $ 39.28 Exercised  (13.6 )  30.78 Forfeited  (1.0 )  59.02 Granted  9.2  77.68 Options outstanding May 31, 2015  58.1  $ 47.00 Options exercisable at May 31,      35.9  $ 27.70  37.0  31.42  34.3  36.53 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Includes stock appreciation rights transactions. ##TABLE_END The weighted average contractual life remaining for options outstanding and options exercisable at May 31, 2015 was 6.0 years and 4.7 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable at May 31, 2015 was $3,178 million and $2,235 million , respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value was the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of the options. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $795 million , $474 million and $293 million , respectively. In addition to the 1990 Plan, the Company gives employees the right to purchase shares at a discount to the market price under employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs). Employees are eligible to participate through payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation. At the end of each six -month offering period, shares are purchased by the participants at 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or the end of the offering period. Employees purchased 1.4 million , 1.4 million and 1.6 million shares during each of the three years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. From time to time, the Company grants restricted stock and restricted stock units to key employees under the 1990 Plan. The number of shares underlying such awards granted to employees during the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were 0.3 million , 0.3 million and 1.6 million , respectively, with weighted average values per share of $79.38 , $63.89 and $46.86 , respectively. Recipients of restricted stock are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respective shares throughout the period of restriction. Recipients of restricted stock units are entitled to dividend equivalent cash payments upon vesting. The value of all grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units was established by the market price on the date of grant. During the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the aggregate fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested was $20 million , $28 million and $25 million , respectively, determined as of the date of vesting. As of May 31, 2015, the Company had $48 million of unrecognized compensation costs from restricted stock units to be recognized in Operating overhead expense over a weighted average period of 1.5 years. ##TABLE_START NOTE 12  Earnings Per Share ##TABLE_ENDThe following is a reconciliation from Basic earnings per common share to Diluted earnings per common share. The computation of Diluted earnings per common share omitted options to purchase an additional 0.1 million , 0.1 million and 0.1 million shares of common stock outstanding for the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, because the options were anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions, except per share data)    Determination of shares:       Weighted average common shares outstanding  861.7  883.4  897.3 Assumed conversion of dilutive stock options and awards  22.7  22.4  19.1 DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING  884.4  905.8  916.4        Earnings per common share from continuing operations:       Basic  $ 3.80  $ 3.05  $ 2.74 Diluted  $ 3.70  $ 2.97  $ 2.68        Earnings per common share from discontinued operations:       Basic  $   $   $ 0.02 Diluted  $   $   $ 0.02        Basic earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc.  $ 3.80  $ 3.05  $ 2.76 Diluted earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc.  $ 3.70  $ 2.97  $ 2.70 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START NOTE 13  Benefit Plans ##TABLE_ENDThe Company has a qualified 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan to which all U.S. employees who work at least 1,000 hours in a year are able to participate. The Company matches a portion of employee contributions. Company contributions to the savings plan were $58 million , $51 million and $46 million for the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and are included in Operating overhead expense . The terms of the plan also allow for annual discretionary profit sharing contributions to the accounts of eligible employees by the Company as determined by the Board of Directors. Contributions of $58 million , $49 million and $47 million were made to the plan and are included in Operating overhead expense for the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The Company also has a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) that was adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by shareholders in September 1997 and later amended in fiscal 2007. The Company recognized $68 million , $46 million and $50 million of Operating overhead expense related to cash awards under the LTIP during the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The Company allows certain highly compensated employees and non-employee directors of the Company to defer compensation under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Deferred compensation plan liabilities were $443 million and $390 million at May 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and primarily classified as long-term in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities . The Company has pension plans in various countries worldwide. The pension plans are only available to local employees and are generally government mandated. The liability related to the unfunded pension liabilities of the plans was $98 million and $100 million at May 31, 2015 and May 31, 2014 , respectively, which was primarily classified as long-term in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities . ##TABLE_START NOTE 14  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ##TABLE_ENDThe changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income , net of tax, were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In millions)  Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment (1)  Cash Flow Hedges  Net Investment Hedges (1)  Other  Total Balance at May 31, 2014  $  $  $  $ (51 )  $ Other comprehensive gains (losses) before reclassifications (2)  (20 )  1,447     1,460 Reclassifications to net income of previously deferred (gains) losses (3)    (259 )    (40 )  (299 ) Other comprehensive income (loss)  (20 )  1,188    (7 )  1,161 Balance at May 31, 2015  $ (11 )  $ 1,220  $  $ (58 )  $ 1,246 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment and net investment hedge gains/losses related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary are reclassified to Net income upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the respective entity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Net of tax benefit (expense) of $ 0 million , $ (33) million , $ 0 million , $ 0 million and $ (33) million , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Net of tax (benefit) expense of $ 0 million , $ 2 million , $ 0 million , $ 0 million and $ 2 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (In millions)  Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment (1)  Cash Flow Hedges  Net Investment Hedges (1)  Other  Total Balance at May 31, 2013  $  $  $  $ (55 )  $ Other comprehensive gains (losses) before reclassifications (2)  (32 )  (134 )      (166 ) Reclassifications to net income of previously deferred (gains) losses (3)    (27 )     (23 ) Other comprehensive income (loss)  (32 )  (161 )     (189 ) Balance at May 31, 2014  $  $  $  $ (51 )  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment and net investment hedge gains/losses related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary are reclassified to Net income upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the respective entity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Net of tax benefit (expense) of $ 0 million , $ 9 million , $ 0 million , $ 0 million and $ 9 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Net of tax (benefit) expense of $ 0 million , $ 9 million , $ 0 million , $ 0 million and $ 9 million respectively. ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the reclassifications from Accumulated other comprehensive income to the Consolidated Statements of Income: ##TABLE_START   Amount of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income     Year Ended May 31, (In millions)   Gains (losses) on cash flow hedges:      Foreign exchange forwards and options  $ (95 )  $ Revenues Foreign exchange forwards and options   Cost of sales Foreign exchange forwards and options     Total selling and administrative expense Foreign exchange forwards and options   Other (income) expense, net Total before tax    Tax expense  (2 )  (9 )  Gain, net of tax    Gains (losses) on other   (4 ) Other (income) expense, net Total before tax   (4 )  Tax expense      Gain (loss), net of tax   (4 )  Total net gain reclassified for the period  $  $  ##TABLE_ENDRefer to Note 17  Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Company's risk management program and derivatives. ##TABLE_START NOTE 15  Discontinued Operations ##TABLE_ENDDuring the year ended May 31, 2013 , the Company divested of Umbro and Cole Haan, allowing it to focus its resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands. On February 1, 2013, the Company completed the sale of Cole Haan to Apax Partners for an agreed upon purchase price of $570 million and received at closing $561 million , net of $9 million of purchase price adjustments. The transaction resulted in a gain on sale of $231 million , net of $137 million in Income tax expense ; this gain is included in the Net income from discontinued operations line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no adjustments to these recorded amounts as of May 31, 2015 . Beginning November 30, 2012, the Company classified the Cole Haan disposal group as held-for-sale and presented the results of Cole Haan's operations in the Net income from discontinued operations line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. From this date until the sale, the assets and liabilities of Cole Haan were recorded in the Assets of discontinued operations and Liabilities of discontinued operations line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. Previously, these amounts were reported in the Company's operating segment presentation as Other Businesses. Under the sale agreement, the Company agreed to provide certain transition services to Cole Haan for an expected period of 3 to 9 months from the date of sale. These services were essentially complete as of May 31, 2013 and the Company has had no significant involvement with Cole Haan beyond the transition services. The Company has also licensed NIKE proprietary Air and Lunar technologies to Cole Haan for a transition period. The continuing cash flows related to these items are not significant to Cole Haan. Additionally, preexisting guarantees of certain Cole Haan lease payments remained in place after the sale; the maximum exposure under the guarantees is $ 23 million at May 31, 2015 . The fair value of the guarantees is not material. On November 30, 2012, the Company completed the sale of certain assets of Umbro to Iconix Brand Group (Iconix) for $ 225 million . The Umbro disposal group was classified as held-for-sale as of November 30, 2012 and the results of Umbro's operations are presented in the Net income from discontinued operations line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The liabilities of Umbro were recorded in the Liabilities of discontinued operations line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Previously, these amounts were reported in the Company's operating segment presentation as Other Businesses. Upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria, the Company recorded a loss of $ 107 million , net of tax, on the sale of Umbro and the loss is included in the Net income from discontinued operations line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The loss on sale was calculated as the net sales price less Umbro assets of $ 248 million , including intangibles, goodwill and fixed assets, other miscellaneous charges of $ 22 million and the release of the associated cumulative translation adjustment of $ 129 million . The tax benefit on the loss was $ 67 million . There were no adjustments to these recorded amounts as of May 31, 2015 . Summarized results of the Company's discontinued operations are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Revenues  $   $   $ Income before income taxes      Income tax expense      NET INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  $   $   $ ##TABLE_ENDThere were no assets or liabilities of discontinued operations as of May 31, 2015 and May 31, 2014 . ##TABLE_START NOTE 16  Commitments and Contingencies ##TABLE_ENDThe Company leases space for certain of its offices, warehouses and retail stores under leases expiring from 1 to 19 years after May 31, 2015 .

These letters of credit were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and guarantees of the Companys performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. In connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the Companys historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of its pending legal matters with certainty, the Company does not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ##TABLE_START NOTE 17  Risk Management and Derivatives ##TABLE_ENDThe Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2015 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs . All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date. The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2015 and 2014 :  ##TABLE_START   Asset Derivatives  Liability Derivatives (In millions)  Balance Sheet Location    Balance Sheet Location   Derivatives formally designated as hedging instruments:             Foreign exchange forwards and options  Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $  $  Accrued liabilities  $  $ Interest rate swaps  Prepaid expenses and other current assets     Accrued liabilities     Foreign exchange forwards and options  Deferred income taxes and other assets    Deferred income taxes and other liabilities   Interest rate swaps  Deferred income taxes and other assets     Deferred income taxes and other liabilities     Total derivatives formally designated as hedging instruments    1,423      Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:             Foreign exchange forwards and options  Prepaid expenses and other current assets    Accrued liabilities   Embedded derivatives  Prepaid expenses and other current assets     Accrued liabilities    Embedded derivatives  Deferred income taxes and other assets     Deferred income taxes and other liabilities    Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments         TOTAL DERIVATIVES    $ 1,639  $    $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe following tables present the amounts affecting the Consolidated Statements of Income for years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 : ##TABLE_START (In millions)  Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income on Derivatives (1)  Amount of Gain (Loss) Reclassified From Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income (1) Year Ended May 31,  Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified From Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Into Income (1)  Year Ended May 31,      Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges:               Foreign exchange forwards and options  $ (202 )  $ (48 )  $  Revenues  $ (95 )  $  $ (19 ) Foreign exchange forwards and options  1,109  (78 )   Cost of sales    Foreign exchange forwards and options     (3 )  Total selling and administrative expense      Foreign exchange forwards and options   (21 )   Other (income) expense, net    Interest rate swaps       Interest expense (income), net       Total designated cash flow hedges  $ 1,480  $ (143 )  $    $  $  $ Derivatives designated as net investment hedges:               Foreign exchange forwards and options  $   $   $   Other (income) expense, net  $   $   $  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) For the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the amounts recorded in Other (income) expense, net as a result of hedge ineffectiveness and the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because the forecasted transactions were no longer probable of occurring were immaterial. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivatives  Location of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivatives   Year Ended May 31,  (In millions)     Derivatives designated as fair value hedges:         Interest rate swaps (1)  $  $  $  Interest expense (income), net Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:         Foreign exchange forwards and options  $  $ (75 )  $  Other (income) expense, net Embedded derivatives  $ (1 )  $ (1 )  $ (4 )  Other (income) expense, net ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.

Refer to Fair Value Hedges in this note for additional detail. ##TABLE_END Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for a description of how the above financial instruments are valued and Note 14  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity for additional information on changes in Other comprehensive income for the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . Cash Flow Hedges The purpose of the Company's foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency exposures that the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external and intercompany revenues, selling and administrative expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions. Product cost exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below. NIKE entities primarily purchase products in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities , including those supporting the Company's North America, Greater China, Japan and European geographies, purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a wholly owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. The Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the Company's existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, the Companys payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order. Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order, and their accounting treatment is described further below. The Companys policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $14.4 billion as of May 31, 2015 . During the year ended May 31, 2015 , the Company entered into a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $1 billion . These instruments were designated as cash flow hedges of the variability in the expected cash outflows of interest payments on future debt due to changes in benchmark interest rates. All changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, excluding any ineffective portion, are recorded in Other comprehensive income until Net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. In most cases, amounts recorded in Other comprehensive income will be released to Net income in periods following the maturity of the related derivative, rather than at maturity. Effective hedge results are classified within the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure, with the results of hedges of non-functional currency denominated revenues and product cost exposures, excluding embedded derivatives as described below, recorded in Revenues or Cost of sales , when the underlying hedged transaction affects consolidated Net income . Results of hedges of selling and administrative expense are recorded together with those costs when the related expense is recorded. Amounts recorded in Other comprehensive income related to forward-starting interest rate swaps will be released through Interest expense (income), net over the term of the issued debt. Results of hedges of anticipated purchases and sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities are recorded in  Other (income) expense, net  when the securities are sold. Results of hedges of certain anticipated intercompany transactions are recorded in Other (income) expense, net  when the transaction occurs. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from these designated cash flow hedge derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Premiums paid on options are initially recorded as deferred charges. The Company assesses the effectiveness of options based on the total cash flows method and records total changes in the options fair value to Other comprehensive income to the degree they are effective. The Company formally assesses, both at a hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Effectiveness for cash flow hedges is assessed based on changes in forward rates . Ineffectiveness was immaterial for the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when: (1) it determines that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item (including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions); (2) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; (3) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, but is expected to occur within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in Accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified to Net income when the forecasted transaction affects consolidated Net income . However, if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were accumulated in Other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in Other (income) expense, net . In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry the derivative at its fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, recognizing future changes in the fair value in Other (income) expense, net . For the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the amounts recorded in Other (income) expense, net as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedging because the forecasted transaction was no longer probable of occurring were immaterial . As of May 31, 2015 , $685 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives accumulated in Other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income . Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2015 , the maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 36 months. Fair Value Hedges The Company is also exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives currently used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. The cash flows associated with the Companys fair value hedges are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding, which are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 or 2013 . As of May 31, 2015 , interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges had a total notional amount of $100 million . Net Investment Hedges The Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign-currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges, except ineffective portions, are reported as a component of Other comprehensive income along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its net investment hedges within the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness based on changes in forward rates. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its net investment hedges for the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 or 2013 . The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2015 . Undesignated Derivative Instruments The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and/or the embedded derivative contracts explained below. These forwards are not designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, these undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net , together with the re-measurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position or embedded derivative contract. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from undesignated instruments within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $4.4 billion as of May 31, 2015 . Embedded Derivatives As part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related purchase order and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net , from the date a purchase order is accepted by a factory through the date the purchase price is no longer subject to foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts. These payment terms expose NIKE to variability in foreign exchange rates and create embedded derivative contracts that must be bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as derivative assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding changes in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net until each payment is settled. At May 31, 2015 , the notional amount of all embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $205 million . Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. However, this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored. The Companys derivative contracts contain credit risk related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Companys bilateral credit related contingent features generally require the owing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of  $50 million  should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than  $50 million . Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also trigger collateral requirements. As of May 31, 2015 , the Company was in compliance with all credit risk related contingent features and had derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position of $4 million . Accordingly, the Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features. Further, as of May 31, 2015 , the Company had received $968 million of cash collateral and $74 million of securities from various counterparties to its derivative contracts (refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements ). Given the considerations described above, the Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be  immaterial . ##TABLE_START NOTE 18  Operating Segments and Related Information ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Companys NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for NIKE, Inc., and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Global Brand Divisions is included within the NIKE Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. Global Brand Divisions primarily represent NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment, and demand creation, operating overhead and product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand. Corporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to the Companys headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses. The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (commonly referred to as EBIT), which represents Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Reconciling items for EBIT represent corporate expense items that are not allocated to the operating segments for management reporting. As part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine months in advance of the future selling season based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entitys functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses. Accounts receivable, net , Inventories and Property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below. Additions to long-lived assets as presented in the following table represent capital expenditures. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2015 presentation. ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    REVENUES       North America  $ 13,740  $ 12,299  $ 11,158 Western Europe  5,709  4,979  4,193 Central  Eastern Europe  1,417  1,387  1,229 Greater China  3,067  2,602  2,478 Japan    Emerging Markets  3,898  3,949  3,832 Global Brand Divisions    Total NIKE Brand  28,701  26,112  23,881 Converse  1,982  1,684  1,449 Corporate  (82 )   (17 ) TOTAL NIKE CONSOLIDATED REVENUES  $ 30,601  $ 27,799  $ 25,313 EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES       North America  $ 3,645  $ 3,077  $ 2,639 Western Europe  1,277   Central  Eastern Europe    Greater China    Japan    Emerging Markets    Global Brand Divisions  (2,263 )  (1,993 )  (1,716 ) Total NIKE Brand  4,817  4,117  3,737 Converse    Corporate  (1,101 )  (1,036 )  (909 ) Total NIKE Consolidated Earnings Before Interest and Taxes  4,233  3,577  3,253 Interest expense (income), net    (3 ) TOTAL NIKE CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS BEFORE TAXES  $ 4,205  $ 3,544  $ 3,256 ADDITIONS TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS       North America  $  $  $ Western Europe    Central  Eastern Europe    Greater China    Japan    Emerging Markets    Global Brand Divisions    Total NIKE Brand    Converse    Corporate    TOTAL ADDITIONS TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS  $ 1,003  $  $ DEPRECIATION       North America  $  $  $ Western Europe    Central  Eastern Europe    Greater China    Japan    Emerging Markets    Global Brand Divisions    Total NIKE Brand    Converse    Corporate    TOTAL DEPRECIATION  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET     North America  $ 1,737  $ 1,505 Western Europe   Central  Eastern Europe   Greater China   Japan   Emerging Markets   Global Brand Divisions   Total NIKE Brand  3,090  3,246 Converse   Corporate   TOTAL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET  $ 3,358  $ 3,434 INVENTORIES     North America  $ 2,207  $ 1,758 Western Europe   Central  Eastern Europe   Greater China   Japan   Emerging Markets   Global Brand Divisions   Total NIKE Brand  3,978  3,706 Converse   Corporate   (20 ) TOTAL INVENTORIES  $ 4,337  $ 3,947 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET     North America  $  $ Western Europe   Central  Eastern Europe   Greater China   Japan   Emerging Markets   Global Brand Divisions   Total NIKE Brand  2,176  2,122 Converse   Corporate   TOTAL PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET  $ 3,011  $ 2,834 ##TABLE_ENDRevenues by Major Product Lines Revenues to external customers for NIKE Brand products are attributable to sales of footwear, apparel and equipment.

Business ##TABLE_START General ##TABLE_END NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the State of Oregon. As used in this report, the terms we, us, NIKE, and the Company refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our NIKE e-commerce website is located at www.nike.com. On our NIKE corporate website, located at news.nike.com, we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC): our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our definitive Proxy Statements are also posted on our corporate website. All such filings on our corporate website are available free of charge. Copies of these filings may also be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549, or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains a website ( www.sec.gov ) that contains current, quarterly and annual reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically. Also available on our corporate website are the charters of the committees of our Board of Directors, as well as our corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics; copies of any of these documents will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores and internet websites (which we refer to collectively as our Direct to Consumer or DTC operations), and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees throughout the world. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment products are produced both in the United States and abroad. ##TABLE_START Products ##TABLE_END We focus our NIKE Brand product offerings in nine key categories: Running, NIKE Basketball, the Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Mens Training, Womens Training, Action Sports, Sportswear (our sports-inspired lifestyle products) and Golf. Men's Training includes our baseball and American football product offerings. We also market products designed for kids, as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as cricket, lacrosse, tennis, volleyball, wrestling, walking and outdoor activities. NIKEs athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in our products. Sportswear, Running, the Jordan Brand and Football (Soccer) are currently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales. We also sell sports apparel covering the above-mentioned categories, which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use and exemplifies our commitment to innovation and high-quality construction. Sportswear, Men's Training, Running, Football (Soccer) and Women's Training are currently our top-selling apparel categories, and we expect them to continue to lead in apparel sales. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in collections of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos. We sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment, golf clubs and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc. Our Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results for the Jordan Brand are reported as a separate category and within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments, respectively. One of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Hurley, headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the Hurley trademark. Sales and operating results for Hurley are included within the NIKE Brand Action Sports category and within the NIKE Brand's North America geographic operating segment, respectively. Another of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis. In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our DTC operations, we have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities. ##TABLE_START Sales and Marketing ##TABLE_END Financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in Note 17  Operating Segments and Related Information of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, operating and logistics-related factors. Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors. We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. Our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Converse Direct to Consumer operations, including e-commerce, are reported within the Converse operating segment results. ##TABLE_START United States Market ##TABLE_ENDFor fiscal 2016 , NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 47% of total revenues, compared to 46% for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 . We sell our NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to thousands of retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit sales as well as independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf and skateboarding. During fiscal 2016 , our three largest customers accounted for approximately 25% of sales in the United States. We make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price. In fiscal 2016 , 84% of our U.S. wholesale footwear shipments were made under the futures program, compared to 87% in fiscal 2015 and 86% in fiscal 2014 . In fiscal 2016 , 66% of our U.S. wholesale apparel shipments were made under the futures program, compared to 67% in fiscal 2015 and 71% in fiscal 2014 . Our Direct to Consumer operations sell NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to consumers through our e-commerce website, www.nike.com . In addition, our Direct to Consumer operations sell through the following number of retail stores in the United States: ##TABLE_START U.S. Retail Stores Number NIKE Brand factory stores NIKE Brand in-line stores, including employee-only stores Converse stores (including factory stores) Hurley stores (including factory and employee stores) TOTAL ##TABLE_ENDIn the United States, NIKE has five significant distribution centers located in Memphis, Tennessee, two of which are owned and three are leased. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our leased Foothill Ranch, California distribution center. Converse and Hurley products are shipped primarily from leased facilities in Ontario, California. Smaller leased distribution facilities are located in various parts of the United States. ##TABLE_START International Markets ##TABLE_ENDFor fiscal 2016 , non-U.S. NIKE Brand and Converse sales accounted for 53% of total revenues, compared to 54% for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 . We sell our products to retail accounts, through our own Direct to Consumer operations and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives around the world. We sell to thousands of retail accounts and ship products from 42 distribution centers outside of the United States. In many countries and regions, including Canada, Asia, some Latin American countries and Europe, we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the United States futures ordering program described above. During fiscal 2016 , NIKEs three largest customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 13% of total non-U.S. sales. In addition to NIKE and Converse owned e-commerce websites in over 40 countries, our Direct to Consumer business operates the following number of retail stores outside the United States: ##TABLE_START Non-U.S. Retail Stores Number NIKE Brand factory stores NIKE Brand in-line stores, including employee-only stores Converse stores (including factory stores) TOTAL ##TABLE_ENDInternational branch offices and subsidiaries of NIKE are located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and Vietnam. ##TABLE_START Significant Customer ##TABLE_ENDNo customer accounted for 10% or more of our worldwide net revenues during fiscal 2016 . ##TABLE_START Orders ##TABLE_ENDWorldwide futures orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from June through November 2016, were $14.9 billion compared with $13.8 billion for the same period last year. NIKE Brand reported futures include (1) orders from external wholesale customers and (2) internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and e-commerce operations which are reflected at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. The U.S. Dollar futures orders amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the actual currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders and the fulfillment of certain of these futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales of at-once and closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, all sales of NIKE Brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our Direct to Consumer in-line stores and e-commerce operations, and sales from our Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf businesses. ##TABLE_START Product Research, Design and Development ##TABLE_ENDWe believe our research, design and development efforts are key factors in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort while reducing waste. In addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs, materials, concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process. As we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories. Using market intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumer preferences. The proliferation of NIKE Air, Lunar, Zoom, Free, Flywire, Dri-Fit, Flyknit, Flyweave and NIKE+ technologies through Running, NIKE Basketball, the Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Men's Training, Women's Training and Sportswear, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products. ##TABLE_START Manufacturing ##TABLE_ENDWe are supplied by approximately 142 footwear factories located in 15 countries. The largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 7% of total fiscal 2016 NIKE Brand footwear production. Virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers who often operate multiple factories. In fiscal 2016 , contract factories in Vietnam, China and Indonesia manufactured approximately 44%, 29% and 21% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. We also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in Argentina, India, Brazil and Mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. In fiscal 2016 , five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69% of NIKE Brand footwear production. We are supplied by approximately 394 apparel factories located in 39 countries. The largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 12% of total fiscal 2016 NIKE Brand apparel production. Virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories. In fiscal 2016 , contract factories in China, Vietnam and Indonesia produced approximately 26%, 23% and 9% of total NIKE Brand apparel, respectively. In fiscal 2016 , one apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more than 10% of apparel production, and the top five contract manufacturers in aggregate accounted for approximately 39% of NIKE Brand apparel production. The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and canvas, as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2016 , NIKE IHM, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NIKE, Inc., with facilities near Beaverton, Oregon and in St. Charles, Missouri, as well as independent contractors in China and Vietnam, were our largest suppliers of the Air-Sole cushioning components used in footwear. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads (both virgin and recycled); specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware. NIKEs independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. NIKE's independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products. Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed significant import-export financing services for us. During fiscal 2016 , Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Canada, India, South Africa and Thailand, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 6% of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates. Our current agreements with Sojitz America expire on May 31, 2018 and contain a provision allowing us to extend the agreements to May 31, 2019. ##TABLE_START International Operations and Trade ##TABLE_ENDOur international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as possible increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future. In recent years, uncertain global and regional economic conditions have affected international trade and caused a rise in protectionist actions around the world. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional measures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole. We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. Moreover, with respect to trade restrictions targeting China, which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us, we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules, and (iii) reflects and considers China's domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community. Where trade protection measures are implemented, we believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability. NIKE advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), if ultimately ratified, has the potential to reduce or eliminate high rates of customs duties for imports into the United States of NIKE products sourced from TPP countries (primarily footwear and apparel from Vietnam and apparel from Malaysia). Similarly, the European Union has concluded a free trade agreement with Vietnam that, if approved, could lead to duty reduction or elimination for footwear and apparel. ##TABLE_START Competition ##TABLE_ENDThe athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment, including adidas, ASICS, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, Puma, V.F. Corporation and Under Armour, among others. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment in the world. Important aspects of competition in this industry are: ##TABLE_START  Product attributes such as quality; performance and reliability; new product innovation and development and consumer price/value. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consumer connection and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing and promotion; social media interaction; customer support and service; identification with prominent and influential athletes, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and online. ##TABLE_END We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas. ##TABLE_START Trademarks and Patents ##TABLE_ENDWe utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh Design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have sought and obtained trademark registrations. We have copyright protection in our design, graphics and other original works. When appropriate, we have sought registrations for this content. We own patents and have a patent license, facilitating our use of Air technologies. We also file and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility patents, as well as many U.S. and foreign design patents protecting components, manufacturing techniques, features and industrial design used in various athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, athletic equipment, digital devices and golf products. These patents expire at various times; patents issued for original applications filed this calendar year in the United States may last until 2031 for design patents and until 2036 for utility patents. We believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patent and trade secret positions. However, we have followed a policy of filing patent applications for the United States and select foreign countries on inventions, designs and improvements that we deem valuable. We also continue to vigorously protect our trademarks and patents against third-party infringement. ##TABLE_START Employees ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2016 , we had approximately 70,700 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. Management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent. None of our employees are represented by a union, except for certain employees in the Emerging Markets geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into and/or comply with industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements. ##TABLE_START Executive Officers of the Registrant ##TABLE_ENDThe executive officers of NIKE, Inc. as of July 15, 2016 are as follows: Mark G.

Risk Factors Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Analyst Reports Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historic information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKEs business plans, objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports, filings with the SEC, press releases, conferences or otherwise, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain the words believe, anticipate, expect, estimate, project, will be, will continue, will likely result or words or phrases of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the SEC, including reports filed on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, and include, among others, the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear, apparel and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products; difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for NIKE products and the various market factors described above; difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining NIKEs increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control; interruptions in data and information technology systems; consumer data security; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance futures orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes in shipment timing, the changing mix of futures and at-once orders, and discounts, order cancellations and returns; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKEs products; increases in the cost of materials, labor and energy used to manufacture products; new product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; product performance and quality; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors and licensees; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in NIKE's debt ratings; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas, political and economic instability and terrorism; changes in government regulations; the impact of, including business and legal developments relating to, climate change, natural disasters, liability and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the effects of NIKE's decision to invest in or divest of businesses and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKEs business and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks, nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on NIKEs business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKEs policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE. Our products face intense competition. NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products. Product offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, customer service and social media presence are areas of intense competition. This, in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly. Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business. Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, product innovation and product quality. Our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design (including materials) and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity. In addition, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns. Negative posts or comments about us on social networking websites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image. If we do not maintain, extend and expand our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits. Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media and online advertising. If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our products. Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products. Research and development plays a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could harm our business. We establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues to develop, evaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with consumers. However, as competition in our industry has increased, the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased. If we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. As a result, our brands, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be harmed. Furthermore, if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues, could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings. A majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States. As a result, we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates globally. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdom's June 23, 2016 referendum in which voters approved the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities. Global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world, most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies. If global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition: ##TABLE_START  Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts, increased inventories and lower gross margins. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We conduct transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum derivatives) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products. ##TABLE_END Our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events, including without limitation the Olympics and the European football championship. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, availability of import quotas, transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues. We make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price. Our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory, purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. We report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports. Although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues, reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for any future period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and at-once orders and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales of at-once and closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, all sales of NIKE Brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our Direct to Consumer in-line stores and e-commerce operations, and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley. Our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins, reduced cash flows and harm to our business. We purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships and diminish brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance. We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers. We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products, we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be canceled, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A slowing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products. Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products. The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retailers with many stores. These retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. These situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity, it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. In addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues. Our Direct to Consumer operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Our Direct to Consumer stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our Direct to Consumer operations, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs. Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Companys control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud; mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation. In addition, extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business. If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our e-commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected. Many of our customers shop with us through our e-commerce website and mobile commerce applications. Increasingly, customers are using tablets and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly e-commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Risks specific to our e-commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers' brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands. Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business. We believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success and our competitive position. We periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products. The actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights. We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, use, importation and/or sale of certain products. We take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information. Such actions include contractual measures such as entering into non-disclosure and non-compete agreements and providing confidential information awareness training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information might not always be effective. Confidential information that is related to business strategy, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, a decline in our stock price and/or a negative impact on our market position, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties or injunctions. In addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, including outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. We are subject to the risk that our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands. We currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. If our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships, supplier relationships or credit risks, it could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. We also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees. The misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us. We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results, operations or reputation. In addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information, we collect transactional and personal information about our customers and users of our digital experiences, which include online distribution channels and product engagement and personal fitness applications. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data, misappropriation of our consumers, users' or employees personal information or a disruption of our business, which could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our consumers, customer relationships and our reputation and result in lost sales, lost users, fines, or lawsuits. We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to and/or redress problems caused by any breach. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data. Compliance with existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly, and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits. Failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct, local laws and other standards could harm our business. We work with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to manufacture our products, and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property. We require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental, health and safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety. Notwithstanding their contractual obligations, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business. Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products. This includes, for example, the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of Brexit, including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union. In addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or additional tax liabilities. We are subject to the tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction, including the United States, subject to significant change. There have been proposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows. We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions. If our capital or financing needs in the United States require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels, our effective income tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted. Portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings that expire in whole or in part from time to time. These tax holidays and rulings may be extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not met. If the tax holidays and rulings are not extended, or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate, our future effective income tax rate would increase in the future. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, the IRS has assessed additional tax liabilities for 2011 and 2012 related to a foreign tax credit matter. We are currently contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. In addition to the risk of additional tax for these years, if this litigation is adversely determined and the IRS was to seek similar adjustments in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. Additionally, we and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates. If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. As part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterpartys liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. We rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products. NIKE is supplied by approximately 142 footwear factories located in 15 countries. We do not own or operate any of our own footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell. In fiscal 2016 , five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of fiscal 2016 footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69% of NIKE Brand footwear production in fiscal 2016 . Our ability to meet our customers' needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers. If one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship, we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing. The principal materials used in our apparel products  natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat or repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware  are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. The principal materials used in our footwear products  natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, nylon, canvas and polyurethane films  are also locally available to manufacturers. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate, train, employ and retain adequate personnel. NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured. There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all. Further, our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future, unexpected increases in work wages, whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short- and long-term. Because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers, could adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air freight, which could adversely affect our profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins. In addition, Sojitz America performs significant import-export financing services for the Company. During fiscal 2016, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Canada, India, South Africa and Thailand (collectively the Sojitz Markets), excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the Sojitz Markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. Our success depends on our global distribution facilities. We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, particularly in emerging markets, depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities. We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. We are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party hosted services (information technology systems), across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities. Our information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems. Over a number of years, we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Our work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to invest in these efforts. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers or other causes, or our failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade our systems, or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. We also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. Furthermore, we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection and use for digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Any interruption in our information technology systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss of users. The market for prime real estate is competitive. Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, both domestically and internationally, depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases. In addition, from time to time, we seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition or close some of our real estate locations, which may require modification of an existing lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, customers, distribution centers and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. From time to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses, product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses, such as our retail operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost-effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. However, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business. The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources. From time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business. Our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business. Our future success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. The sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock. As of June 30, 2016, Swoosh, LLC beneficially owned more than 78% of our Class A Common Stock. If, on June 30, 2016, all of these shares were converted into Class B Common Stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 16%. The shares are available for resale, subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H. Knight, our Chairman Emeritus, to hold the majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock. On June 30, 2016, Mr. Knight sold his voting interest in Swoosh, LLC to a trust controlled by his son and NIKE director, Travis Knight. Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options. Our long-term debt is currently rated Investment Grade by Standard  Poors and Moodys Investors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default, and as a result, the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt. If our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results could be adversely affected. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventories, contingent payments under endorsement contracts, accounting for property, plant and equipment and definite-lived assets and goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock. Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock. There are provisions of our articles of incorporation and Oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, a freeze-out statute, two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company. We may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline. Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts estimates of our future performance. Analysts estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. ", "2": " ITEM 2. Properties The following is a summary of principal properties owned or leased by NIKE: The NIKE World Campus, owned by NIKE and located near Beaverton, Oregon, USA, is a 400-acre site consisting of over 40 buildings which, together with adjacent leased properties, functions as our world headquarters and is occupied by approximately 10,700 employees engaged in management, research, design, development, marketing, finance and other administrative functions serving nearly all of our divisions. We also lease various office facilities in the surrounding metropolitan area. We lease a similar, but smaller, administrative facility in Hilversum, the Netherlands, which serves as the headquarters for the Western Europe and Central  Eastern Europe geographies and management of certain brand functions for our non-U.S. operations. We also lease an office complex in Shanghai, China, our headquarters for Greater China, occupied by employees focused on implementing our wholesale, DTC and merchandising strategies in the region, among other functions. In the United States, NIKE has five significant distribution centers located in Memphis, Tennessee, two of which are owned and three are leased. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California distribution center, which we lease. Smaller leased distribution facilities are located in various parts of the United States. We also own or lease distribution and customer service facilities outside the United States. The most significant are the distribution facilities located in Laakdal, Belgium; Taicang, China; Tomisato, Japan and Incheon, Korea, all of which we own. NIKE IHM, Inc. manufactures Air-Sole cushioning components at NIKE-owned facilities located near Beaverton, Oregon and in St. Charles, Missouri. We also manufacture and sell small amounts of various other plastic products to other manufacturers through NIKE IHM, Inc.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company concluded its four-year, $8 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in September 2012. Under this program the Company purchased a total of 197.1 million shares at a cost of $8 billion (an average price of $40.58 per share). Following the completion of this program, the Company began repurchases under the new four-year, $12 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in November 2015. As of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 , the Company had repurchased 20.1 million shares at an average price of $59.21 per share for a total approximate cost of $1.2 billion under the new program. We intend to use excess cash, future cash from operations and/or proceeds from debt to fund repurchases under the share repurchase program.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned in-line and factory retail stores and NIKE-owned internet websites (which we refer to collectively as our Direct to Consumer or DTC operations) and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, must have products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online. In addition to achieving long-term, sustainable revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas: ##TABLE_START  Expanding gross margin by: ##TABLE_END - Delivering innovative, premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a balanced price-to-value equation for consumers; - Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation; - Making our supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation, help reduce waste and have long-term potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market; and - Driving growth in our higher gross margin DTC business, led by NIKE.com, as part of an integrated marketplace growth strategy across our DTC and wholesale operations. ##TABLE_START  Optimizing selling and administrative expense by focusing on: ##TABLE_END - Investments in consumer engagement that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit; - Infrastructure investments that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations; and - Investments in key areas of future growth, including our DTC business. ##TABLE_START  Managing working capital efficiency; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Deploying capital effectively. ##TABLE_END Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2020, on average per year, are as follows: ##TABLE_START  High single-digit to low-double digit revenue growth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Mid-teens earnings per share growth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  High-twenties to low-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Free cash flow growing faster than net income; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sustainable, profitable, long-term growth through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. ##TABLE_END Over the past ten years, we have achieved many of our financial goals. During this time, revenues and diluted earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc., inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, have grown 8% and 13%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. We expanded gross margin by approximately 220 basis points and our return on invested capital has increased from 22.6% to 29.7%. On November 19, 2015, we announced a two-for-one stock split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2015. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 24, 2015. All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. Our fiscal 2016 results demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to deliver continued growth and expanding profitability. Despite significant foreign currency headwinds, we achieved record revenues and earnings per share for fiscal 2016. NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 6% to $32.4 billion, gross margin expanded 20 basis points, Net income increased 15% and diluted earnings per common share grew 17% to $2.16. We also delivered strong cash returns to shareholders while investing for long-term growth. Earnings before interest and income taxes (\"EBIT\") increased 10% for fiscal 2016, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion, while selling and administrative expense was flat as a percent of revenues. The increase in revenues was attributable to growth for nearly every NIKE Brand geography and across most key categories and product types. This broad-based growth was primarily fueled by: ##TABLE_START  Innovative performance and sportswear products, incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE Air, Free, Zoom, Lunar, Flywire, Dri-Fit and Flyknit; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Deep brand connections with consumers through our category offense, reinforced by investments in endorsements by high-profile athletes, sports teams and leagues, high-impact marketing around global sporting events and digital marketing; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Strong category retail presentation online and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores. ##TABLE_END Converse revenues and EBIT decreased 1% and 6%, respectively, as growth in direct distribution markets was more than offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Gross margin increased primarily due to higher full-price average selling price and the favorable impact of growth in our higher-margin DTC businesses, partially offset by higher product costs, primarily due to shifts in mix to higher-cost products and labor input cost inflation, higher off-price mix and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For fiscal 2016, the growth in Net income was positively affected by a year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate of 350 basis points primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside the United States, which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. Diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate than Net income due to a 1% decrease in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program. While foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above. ##TABLE_START Results of Operations ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data)  Fiscal 2016  Fiscal 2015  % Change  Fiscal 2014  % Change Revenues  $ 32,376  $ 30,601  %  $ 27,799  % Cost of sales  17,405  16,534  %  15,353  % Gross profit  14,971  14,067  %  12,446  % Gross margin %  46.2 %  46.0 %    44.8 %   Demand creation expense  3,278  3,213  %  3,031  % Operating overhead expense  7,191  6,679  %  5,735  % Total selling and administrative expense  10,469  9,892  %  8,766  % % of Revenues  32.3 %  32.3 %    31.5 %   Interest expense (income), net        Other (income) expense, net  (140 )  (58 )      Income before income taxes  4,623  4,205  %  3,544  % Income tax expense    %   % Effective tax rate  18.7 %  22.2 %    24.0 %   Net income  $ 3,760  $ 3,273  %  $ 2,693  % Diluted earnings per common share  $ 2.16  $ 1.85  %  $ 1.49  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Consolidated Operating Results ##TABLE_ENDRevenues ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 (1) % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes (2) Fiscal 2014 (1) % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes (2) NIKE, Inc.

Revenues grew 12% for fiscal 2016, primarily driven by higher revenues for the NIKE Brand. Every NIKE Brand geography grew revenues for fiscal 2016 as our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers online and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores, driving strong demand for NIKE Brand products. North America contributed approximately 4 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. revenues, while Greater China and Western Europe each contributed approximately 3 percentage points, Emerging Markets contributed approximately 2 percentage points and Central  Eastern Europe contributed approximately 1 percentage point. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 15% and 11%, respectively, for fiscal 2016, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 2%. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2016 was driven by growth in nearly every key category, including strong growth in Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2016 increased 9%, with higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributing approximately 6 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was driven by higher full-price ASP, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business. The constant-currency increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2016 was attributable to growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Men's Training, Running, Women's Training and Football (Soccer). Apparel unit sales for fiscal 2016 increased 7%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and growth in our higher-priced DTC business. While wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to expand our DTC businesses in each of our geographies. NIKE Brand DTC operations include NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through NIKE-owned websites. For fiscal 2016, DTC revenues represented approximately 26% of our total NIKE Brand revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues increased 25% for fiscal 2016, driven by strong online sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 10%. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Online sales through NIKE-owned websites, which are not included in comparable store sales, grew 51% in fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2016, online sales represented approximately 22% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues. On a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2016 NIKE Brand Mens revenues increased 11%, driven by growth in Sportswear and the Jordan Brand, while Women's revenues increased 17%, led by Sportswear, Running and Women's Training. Revenues for our Young Athletes' business increased 11%, with growth across multiple categories, most notably the Jordan Brand. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  On a currency-neutral basis, revenues from NIKE, Inc. continuing operations grew 14% for fiscal 2015, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and Converse. Every NIKE Brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2015 as our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers. North America contributed 5 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. revenues, while Western Europe contributed 4 percentage points, Greater China contributed 2 percentage points and Central  Eastern Europe, Emerging Markets and Converse each contributed 1 percentage point. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 17% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 1% during fiscal 2015. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2015 was driven by strong performance in Sportswear, the Jordan Brand, Running, NIKE Basketball and Football (Soccer). Footwear unit sales in fiscal 2015 increased 9%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven primarily by higher full-price ASP, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of growth in our higher-priced DTC business. The constant-currency increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2015 was driven by growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running and Women's Training, which were partially offset by a decline in Football (Soccer) due largely to the comparison to significant sales of replica apparel in advance of the World Cup in 2014. Fiscal 2015 unit sales of apparel increased 8% with higher ASP per unit contributing approximately 2 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, driven primarily by growth in our higher-priced DTC business. For fiscal 2015, DTC revenues represented approximately 23% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 20% in fiscal 2014. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues grew 29% for fiscal 2015, driven by strong comparable store sales growth of 16%, significant online sales growth and the addition of new stores. Online sales through NIKE-owned websites grew 59% in fiscal 2015. Online sales represented approximately 18% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2015 compared to 15% for fiscal 2014. On a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2015 NIKE Brand Mens revenues increased 9%, driven by growth in our Sportswear, the Jordan Brand, NIKE Basketball and Running categories. Womens revenues accelerated in fiscal 2015, achieving 20% growth primarily due to increases in Sportswear, Running and Women's Training categories. Revenues in our Young Athletes' business increased 19% as a result of continued efforts to expand footwear and apparel offerings for this group across multiple categories, particularly the Jordan Brand. Futures Orders Futures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2016 totaled $ 14.9 billion and were 8% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. NIKE Brand reported futures include (1) orders from external wholesale customers and (2) internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and e-commerce operations which are reflected at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. The U.S. Dollar futures orders amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders increased 11% , with unit orders increasing 4% and average selling price per unit contributing approximately 7 percentage points of growth. By geography, futures orders growth was as follows: ##TABLE_START   Reported Futures Orders  Futures Orders Excluding Currency Changes (1) North America  6%  6% Western Europe  8%  11% Central  Eastern Europe  3%  7% Greater China  19%  24% Japan  24%  15% Emerging Markets  3%  13% TOTAL NIKE BRAND FUTURES ORDERS  8%  11% ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Reported futures have been restated using prior year exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. ##TABLE_END The reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and at-once orders, and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales of at-once and closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, all sales of NIKE Brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and e-commerce operations, and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley.

For fiscal 2016, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in Demand creation expense by approximately 6 percentage points. Operating overhead expense increased 8% compared to fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of continued investments in our DTC business, including new store openings and higher variable expenses, as well as targeted investments in operational infrastructure and consumer-focused digital capabilities, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in Operating overhead expense by approximately 4 percentage points for fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  Demand creation expense increased 6% for fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to support for key brand and consumer events, including the World Cup in early fiscal 2015, increased digital brand marketing, investments in DTC marketing and higher sports marketing expense. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in Demand creation expense by approximately 4 percentage points for fiscal 2015. Operating overhead expense increased 16% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by investments in our rapidly growing DTC business, including new store openings and higher variable expenses, investments in operational infrastructure and consumer-focused digital capabilities and higher performance-based compensation. For fiscal 2015, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in Operating overhead expense by approximately 3 percentage points.

Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015  Other (income) expense, net increased from $58 million of other income, net for fiscal 2015 to $140 million of other income, net for fiscal 2016, driven by a $26 million net change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, a favorable settlement of a legal judgment related to a bankruptcy case in Western Europe and net gains from other non-operating items. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international business and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $423 million for fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  Other (income) expense, net shifted from $103 million of other expense, net for fiscal 2014 to $58 million of other income, net for fiscal 2015, primarily driven by a $147 million net change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, primarily due to significant hedge gains from available-for-sale investments, as well as an adverse legal judgment in the prior year related to a long outstanding bankruptcy case for a former customer in Western Europe. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international business and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $73 million for fiscal 2015.

Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  The 180 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to the favorable resolution of audits in several jurisdictions. ##TABLE_START Operating Segments ##TABLE_ENDOur operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Companys internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Companys NIKE Brand DTC operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.

As discussed in Note 17  Operating Segments and Related Information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain corporate costs are not included in EBIT of our operating segments.

DTC revenues grew 17% for fiscal 2016, fueled by strong online sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 6%. Currency-neutral footwear revenue growth was attributable to higher revenues in most key categories, led by the Jordan Brand, Sportswear, Running and Women's Training, partially offset by a slight decline in NIKE Basketball. Fiscal 2016 unit sales of footwear increased 8%. Higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business, partially offset by higher off-price mix. Apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by our Sportswear and Men's Training categories. For fiscal 2016, unit sales of apparel grew 7%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth, primarily attributable to higher full-price ASP. Reported EBIT increased 3% for fiscal 2016 as higher revenues were largely offset by lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin declined 80 basis points as higher off-price mix, higher warehousing and inventory obsolescence costs, as well as higher product input costs more than offset higher full-price ASP. Selling and administrative expense increased as a percent of revenues as higher operating overhead to support our growing DTC operations and bad debt expense related to customer bankruptcies was only partially offset by lower performance-based compensation. Demand creation also grew at a faster rate than revenues due to higher spending for sports marketing, DTC marketing and key brand events and initiatives, partially offset by lower advertising expense. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  North America revenues increased 12%, despite congestion at ports on the West Coast of the United States in the second half of the fiscal year, which affected the Company's supply chain and flow of product to customers. Revenue growth was driven by nearly all key categories for fiscal 2015, led by the Jordan Brand, Sportswear, Men's Training, NIKE Basketball and Women's Training. On a constant currency basis, DTC revenue grew 17% for fiscal 2015, fueled by comparable store sales growth of 8%, strong online sales growth and the addition of new stores. Footwear revenue growth was driven by increases in most key categories, notably the Jordan Brand, NIKE Basketball and Sportswear. Unit sales of footwear for fiscal 2015 increased 6%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP. Apparel revenue growth was attributable to strong demand in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Men's Training, Women's Training and Running, partially offset by slight declines in Football (Soccer) and Action Sports. For fiscal 2015, unit sales of apparel increased 9%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, driven primarily by higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of growth in our higher-priced DTC business. EBIT grew 18% for fiscal 2015 as a result of higher revenues, gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 110 basis points due to higher full-price ASP, improved off-price product margins and lower inventory obsolescence costs, partially offset by higher product input and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense decreased as a percent of revenues despite higher demand creation expense to support key brand and sporting events and higher sports marketing expense. Operating overhead costs also increased to support DTC growth and investments in infrastructure, as well as higher performance-based compensation costs.

Growth was led by our largest territories, the UK  Ireland and AGS (Austria, Germany and Switzerland), which grew 12% and 16%, respectively. On a category basis, revenues grew for every key category, most notably Sportswear, Football (Soccer) and the Jordan Brand. DTC revenues grew 28% for fiscal 2016, due to strong online sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 13%. Currency-neutral footwear revenue growth was fueled by increases in most key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. For fiscal 2016, unit sales of footwear increased 10%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 4 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business, partially offset by higher off-price mix. The constant currency apparel revenue growth was attributable to increases in every key category, most notably Sportswear, with Football (Soccer) also providing strong growth. Unit sales of apparel for fiscal 2016 increased 11%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily driven by the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business and higher full-price ASP. On a reported basis, EBIT grew 12% for fiscal 2016, despite the negative translation impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the Euro. EBIT grew at a higher rate than revenue as selling and administrative expense leverage and the favorable settlement of a legal judgment related to a bankruptcy case reflected in Other (income) expense, net , were only partially offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin declined 10 basis points as unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher off-price mix were mostly offset by higher full-price ASP, shifts in mix to lower-cost products and growth in our higher-margin DTC business. Selling and administrative expense was lower as a percent of revenues despite higher operating overhead, primarily to support DTC expansion. Demand creation increased slightly as higher spending for DTC and other demand creation costs more than offset lower sports marketing costs. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for fiscal 2015 increased 21% and grew in every territory, led by AGS and the UK  Ireland, our largest territories in Western Europe, which grew 27% and 20%, respectively. Revenues grew for every key category, most notably Sportswear and Running. DTC revenues grew 40%, driven by comparable store sales growth of 24%, strong online sales growth and the addition of new stores. The constant currency footwear revenue growth was driven by increases in nearly every category, most notably Sportswear, Running and Football (Soccer). For fiscal 2015, unit sales of footwear increased 20%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 5 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven equally by higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of growth in our higher-priced DTC business. The constant currency apparel revenue growth was attributable to increases in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear, Women's Training and Running, partially offset by a slight decline in Football (Soccer) primarily due to the impact of World Cup in fiscal 2014. Unit sales of apparel in fiscal 2015 increased 14% while ASP per unit was flat. Despite the negative translation impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the Euro, reported EBIT grew 49% for fiscal 2015 as a result of strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 190 basis points, primarily due to favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher full-price ASP, which were only partially offset by higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense decreased as a percent of revenues despite increases in operating overhead, primarily as a result of higher costs to support our growing DTC business. Demand creation increased largely as a result of higher sports marketing and digital demand creation costs.

On a reported basis, EBIT increased 16% for fiscal 2016, despite the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Russian Ruble and Turkish Lira. EBIT grew faster than reported revenues due to significant gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 140 basis points as significantly higher full-price ASP, warehousing efficiencies and the favorable impact of a higher proportion of revenues from our higher-margin DTC business more than offset unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and shifts in mix to higher-cost products. Selling and administrative expense decreased as a percent of revenues despite higher operating overhead to support DTC expansion and higher demand creation expense due to increased sports marketing costs and spending to support brand events. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Central  Eastern Europe revenues for fiscal 2015 grew 15%, attributable to increases in most territories. Turkey grew 23% and our distributors business grew 18%, while revenues declined in Israel, our smallest territory.

Revenues declined 5% in Brazil, primarily reflecting on-going macroeconomic challenges. On a category basis, revenues grew in nearly every key category, led by Sportswear and Running. DTC revenues increased 23%, driven by the addition of new stores, comparable store sales growth of 7% and online sales growth. The constant currency growth in footwear revenue for fiscal 2016 was driven by higher revenues in nearly every key category, most notably Sportswear and Running. For fiscal 2016, unit sales of footwear increased 1%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 13 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP was attributable to higher full-price ASP, primarily reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business. The constant currency growth in apparel revenue was due to increases in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running and Women's Training. Fiscal 2016 unit sales of apparel decreased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 13 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP was due to higher full-price ASP, primarily reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business. On a reported basis, EBIT increased 9%, despite the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Argentine Peso, Mexican Peso and Korean Won, as gross margin expansion more than offset lower reported revenues and higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin expanded 350 basis points due to higher full-price ASP, lower warehousing and obsolescence costs, and growth in our higher-margin DTC business, partially offset by shifts in mix to higher-cost products and unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense declined on a reported basis, but was higher as a percent of revenues as higher operating overhead due to additional investments in our DTC business and operating infrastructure, and higher performance-based compensation were more than offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Demand creation expense also increased driven by sports marketing and digital brand marketing costs, offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  On a currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2015 revenues for Emerging Markets increased 8%, driven by growth in 7 of 9 territories. Growth was led by SOCO and Pacific which grew 28% and 26%, respectively. Revenues in our Mexico and Brazil territories decreased 21% and 3%, respectively. The decrease in Mexico was attributable to efforts to liquidate excess inventory in the marketplace largely resulting from an inconsistent flow of product to customers following distribution center transition issues in fiscal 2014, while the decrease in Brazil was primarily due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and comparison to strong sales related to the World Cup in fiscal 2014. On a category basis, revenues were higher in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Action Sports and the Jordan Brand, partially offset by a decline in Football (Soccer). DTC revenues increased 51% compared to fiscal 2014, driven by strong comparable store sales growth of 26%, the addition of new stores and online sales growth. The constant currency growth in footwear revenue for fiscal 2015 was attributable to increases in several key categories, most notably Sportswear, Action Sports, the Jordan Brand and Running. Unit sales of footwear decreased 2% while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 11 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher full-price ASP reflecting price increases in response to inflationary conditions in certain Latin American countries, particularly Argentina, as well as the favorable impact of growth in our higher-priced DTC business. Constant currency apparel revenue growth was due to increases in nearly all key categories, primarily Sportswear, Running and Women's Training, partially offset by a decline in Football (Soccer) revenues due to higher World Cup sales in fiscal 2014. Unit sales of apparel decreased 1% for fiscal 2015. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily attributable to an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business, and to a lesser extent, higher full-price ASP driven by price increases in response to inflationary conditions. On a reported basis, EBIT decreased 14% primarily due to reported revenue declines, lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense, as well as the impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates . Gross margin decreased 140 basis points due to unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, higher inventory obsolescence and higher off-price mix, partially offset by higher full-price ASP. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs, primarily to support DTC growth, as well as higher demand creation expense, in part as a result of support for the World Cup in early fiscal 2015 and higher sports marketing expense.

Revenues for Global Brand Divisions are primarily attributable to NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015  Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes increased $329 million for fiscal 2016 due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense, and to a lesser extent, lower revenues, largely resulting from the expiration of certain football club endorsement agreements. Operating overhead increased due to investments in operational infrastructure and consumer-focused digital capabilities, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expenses. Demand creation expense increased due to higher advertising and digital brand marketing expenses. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes increased $274 million in fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher operating overhead reflecting continued investments in operational infrastructure, including digital capabilities, consumer engagement and supply chain initiatives, as well as higher performance-based compensation.

On a territory basis, growth in the United States and Asia Pacific was partially offset by declines in Europe, primarily the United Kingdom. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution markets had an insignificant impact on total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2016. Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 15% for fiscal 2016, reducing total Converse revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point. The decrease in comparable licensed markets revenues was primarily due to poor macroeconomic conditions in Latin America. Reported EBIT for Converse decreased 6% for fiscal 2016 as a decrease in reported revenues and lower gross margin more than offset selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin declined 220 basis points as unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, shifts in mix to higher-cost products and higher off-price mix more than offset higher full-price ASP. Selling and administrative expense declined faster than reported revenues primarily due to lower demand creation, which more than offset slightly higher operating overhead due to investments in infrastructure to support growth. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Converse increased 21% for fiscal 2015. Comparable direct distribution markets grew 14%, contributing 12 percentage points of total revenue growth for fiscal 2015. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 12% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of Converse comparable direct distribution market revenue growth. The United States market was the most significant contributor to the growth of comparable direct distribution markets due to volume increases with key wholesale customers and expansion of our DTC business. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution contributed 8 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2015, driven by conversion of several European markets, most significantly AGS (Austria, Germany and Switzerland). Revenues from comparable licensed markets increased 8% for fiscal 2015, contributing 1 percentage point of total Converse revenue growth. EBIT for Converse increased 4% for fiscal 2015 as strong revenue growth was partially offset by lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin decreased 60 basis points primarily due to transitions of licensed markets to direct distribution markets. Selling and administrative expense increased for fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher operating overhead costs resulting from investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth, including market transitions, new systems and new headquarters, as well as higher intellectual property enforcement costs.

The Corporate loss before interest and taxes consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses. In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015  For fiscal 2016, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased $76 million primarily due to the following: ##TABLE_START  an increase of $179 million, primarily driven by higher operating overhead expense to support corporate growth initiatives; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a beneficial change of $76 million from net foreign currency losses to net foreign currency gains related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains; these gains are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a beneficial change of $27 million in net foreign currency gains related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of Other (income) expense, net. ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  For fiscal 2015, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased $61 million primarily due to the following: ##TABLE_START  a $203 million increase, primarily in corporate overhead expense related to corporate initiatives to support growth of the business as well as higher performance-based compensation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $144 million beneficial change from net foreign currency losses to net foreign currency gains, reported as a component of Other (income) expense, net ; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  an approximate $2 million increase in foreign exchange losses related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains; these losses are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices ##TABLE_ENDOverview As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (\"NTC\") and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Transactional Exposures We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: ##TABLE_START  Product Costs  NIKEs product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. ##TABLE_END In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost. ##TABLE_START 2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. ##TABLE_END For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net . Refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthe ning U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKEs U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost. ##TABLE_START  Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales  A portion of our Western Europe and Central  Eastern Europe geography revenues, as well as a portion of our Converse European operations revenues, are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Costs  Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has also entered into other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to foreign currencies and create embedded derivative contracts that are recorded at fair value through  Other (income) expense, net . Refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities  Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations. ##TABLE_END Managing Transactional Exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost purchase exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements and Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end. Translational Exposures Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $1,985 million and $1,171 million for the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $449 million and $221 million for the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Managing Translational Exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements and Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end. We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $423 million and $73 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for net investment hedges. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2016 and 2015. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015. ##TABLE_START Liquidity and Capital Resources ##TABLE_ENDCash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $3,096 million for fiscal 2016 compared to $4,680 million for fiscal 2015 . Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2016 was Net income of $3,760 million . Our fiscal 2016 change in working capital was a net cash outflow of $1,580 million as compared to a net cash inflow of $256 million for fiscal 2015 . The change in working capital was primarily due to a net decrease in the amount of cash collateral received as a result of hedging activities (refer to the Credit Risk section of Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives for additional detail). For fiscal 2016, cash collateral received from counterparties declined $863 million as compared to an increase in collateral received from counterparties of $968 million for fiscal 2015. Cash used by investing activities was $1,034 million for fiscal 2016 , compared to a $175 million use of cash for fiscal 2015 . The primary driver of the increase in Cash used by investing activities was the net change in short-term investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) from net sales/maturities to net purchases. In fiscal 2016, there were $57 million of net purchases of short-term investments compared to $935 million of net sales/maturities of short-term investments in the same period of fiscal 2015. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $1,143 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to $963 million for fiscal 2015. The increase in Additions to property, plant and equipment resulted from continued investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth, primarily relating to supply chain and corporate initiatives, as well as expansion of our DTC operations. In fiscal 2017, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, as well as expand our digital capabilities. We anticipate investing approximately 4% of revenue, a portion of which will be used for the continued expansion of our corporate facilities, new DTC stores and digital capabilities. Cash used by financing activities was $2,671 million for fiscal 2016 compared to $2,790 million for fiscal 2015 , a decrease of $119 million, as increases in share repurchases and dividends were more than offset by the receipt of $981 million in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in October 2015. In fiscal 2016 , we purchased 55.4 million shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock for $3,238 million (an average price of $ 58.44 ). During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we concluded the Company's four-year, $8 billion share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2012. Under this program the Company purchased a total of 197.1 million shares at a cost of $8 billion (an average price of $40.58 per share). Following the completion of this program, the Company began purchases under a four-year, $12 billion program approved by our Board of Directors in November 2015. Of the total 55.4 million shares repurchased in fiscal 2016, 20.1 million shares were purchased under this new program at a cost of approximately $1,189 million (an average price of $59.21 per share). We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Capital Resources On April 23, 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement (the \"Shelf\") with the SEC which permitted us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities. On April 23, 2013, we issued $1.0 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043. The 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 2.25% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2023. The 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.625% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2043. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of $998 million. On October 29, 2015, we issued an additional $1.0 billion of senior notes at a 3.875% fixed, annual interest rate that will mature on November 1, 2045. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted in proceeds before expenses of $991 million. The Shelf expired on April 23, 2016. We plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the SEC in July 2016. On August 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. This facility replaces the prior $1 billion credit facility agreement entered into on November 1, 2011, which would have matured November 1, 2017. As of and for the periods ended May 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had no amounts outstanding under either committed credit facility. We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2016 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our $2 billion commercial paper program, which increased $1 billion during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. During the year ended May 31, 2016 , we did not issue commercial paper, and as of May 31, 2016 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this program. Any future issuance of commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2017 will depend on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. As of May 31, 2016 , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $5.5 billion , of which $4.6 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Included in Cash and equivalents as of May 31, 2016 was $105 million of cash collateral received from counterparties as a result of hedging activity. Cash equivalents and Short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2016 , the weighted average remaining duration of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 91 days. To date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the United States through debt, we would incur additional interest expense . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2016 and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows: ##TABLE_START Description of Commitment  Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, (In millions)       Thereafter  Total Operating Leases  $  $  $  $  $  $ 1,244  $ 3,231 Capital Leases          Long-Term Debt (1)       3,365  3,774 Endorsement Contracts (2)  1,198  1,238     4,514  9,420 Product Purchase Obligations (3)  4,149            4,149 Other Purchase Obligations (4)        TOTAL  $ 6,344  $ 1,889  $ 1,506  $ 1,297  $ 1,112  $ 9,213  $ 21,361 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2016 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. ##TABLE_END In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. ##TABLE_START (3) We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and e-commerce operations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Other purchase obligations primarily include service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. ##TABLE_END In addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes and Note 13  Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2016 . Refer to Note 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. ##TABLE_START  Outstanding as of (In millions) May 31, 2016 Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand $ Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2016 , the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling $157 million . These letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Companys performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. ##TABLE_START New Accounting Pronouncements ##TABLE_ENDRefer to Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards. ##TABLE_START Critical Accounting Policies ##TABLE_ENDOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and online store revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the United States, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. We base our estimates on (1) historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims are significantly greater or lower than established reserves, we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales . If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to Cost of sales . Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are recorded in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance, increased or decreased Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract term. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the assets net book value to its salvage value. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. We may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any. We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Fair Value Measurements For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, including U.S. Treasury securities. In the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as time deposits, commercial paper and bonds, U.S. Agency securities and money market funds. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our available-for-sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include a comparison to another independent pricing vendor. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Other comprehensive income , rather than Net income , until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income . In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Other comprehensive income into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Other comprehensive income to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. We have used in the past, and may use in the future, forward contracts or options to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the forward contracts or options hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income within Total shareholders equity , to the extent effective, to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported as Other (income) expense, net during the period in which changes occur. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Income Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, thus reducing our overall Income tax expense . The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional Income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our Income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense . The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense . Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2016 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. See section Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices under Item 7 for additional detail. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, fixed-rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixed-rate debt, as well as pay-fixed, receive-variable forward-starting interest rate swaps for cash outflows of interest payments on future debt. ##TABLE_START Market Risk Measurement ##TABLE_ENDWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (VaR). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $109 million and $117 million at May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The VaR decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio at May 31, 2016. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $209 million and $205 million during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows. During the year ended May 31, 2016, we entered into a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements. A forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. We entered into these forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuance of debt. These instruments were designated as cash flow hedges of the variability in the expected cash outflows of interest payments on future debt due to changes in benchmark interest rates. Details of third-party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. ##TABLE_START   Expected Maturity Date Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions)       Thereafter  Total  Fair Value Foreign Exchange Risk                 Japanese Yen Functional Currency                 Long-term Japanese Yen debt  Fixed rate                 Principal payments  $  $  $  $  $  $   $  $ Average interest rate  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  0.0 %  2.4 %   Interest Rate Risk                 Japanese Yen Functional Currency                 Long-term Japanese Yen debt  Fixed rate                 Principal payments  $  $  $  $  $  $   $  $ Average interest rate  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  0.0 %  2.4 %   U.S. Dollar Functional Currency                 Long-term U.S. Dollar debt  Fixed rate                 Principal payments  $  $   $   $   $   $ 2,000  $ 2,038  $ 2,097 Average interest rate  6.2 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  3.4 %  3.5 %   Anticipated long-term U.S. Dollar debt issuance - Floating rate swapped to fixed rate                 Notional (1)  $ 1,500  $   $   $   $   $   $ 1,500  $ Weighted-average fixed rate  2.2 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  2.2 %   Weighted-average floating rate  0.7 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.7 %   ##TABLE_END(1) Forward-starting interest rate swaps have been included in the maturities category based on when the related forecasted debt issuance and corresponding swap terminations are expected to occur.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect on the financial statements. While reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, it does not mean absolute assurance. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatement and instance of fraud. Controls are susceptible to manipulation, especially in instances of fraud caused by the collusion of two or more people, including our senior management. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2016 . PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited (1) the Consolidated Financial Statements and (2) the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016 , as stated in their report herein. ##TABLE_START Mark G.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /S/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP Portland, Oregon July 21, 2016   ##TABLE_START NIKE, Inc.

NIKE, Inc. portfolio brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse. The NIKE Brand is focused on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services across a wide range of sport categories, amplified with sport-inspired sportswear products carrying the Swoosh trademark as well as other NIKE Brand trademarks. The Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories, using the Jumpman trademark. Sales of Jordan Brand products are reported as a separate category within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. The Hurley brand is focused on surf and action sports and youth lifestyle footwear, apparel and accessories, using the Hurley trademark. Sales of Hurley brand products are included within the NIKE Brand Action Sports category and within the NIKE Brand's North America geographic operating segment, respectively. Converse designs, distributes, markets and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis. Basis of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. On November 19, 2015, the Company announced a two -for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2015. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 24, 2015. All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2016 presentation. Revenue Recognition Wholesale revenues are recognized when title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. This occurs upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and online store revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims from customers are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale. Post-invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. Estimates of discretionary discounts, returns and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and (3) estimated discounts, returns and claims expected, but not yet finalized with customers. As of May 31, 2016 and 2015 , the Companys reserve balances for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims were $789 million and $724 million , respectively. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and research, design and development costs. Outbound shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales . Operating Overhead Expense Operating overhead expense consists primarily of payroll and benefit related costs, rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services and meetings and travel. Demand Creation Expense Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, television, digital and print advertising, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run. Advertising communication costs are expensed when the advertisement appears. Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is completed and delivered. A significant amount of the Companys promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. Accounting for endorsement payments is based upon specific contract provisions. Generally, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract after giving recognition to periodic performance compliance provisions of the contracts. Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). The Company records demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When the Company determines payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from the Company's estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance, increased or decreased demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. The Company expenses these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, the Company offers minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which the Company estimates it will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, the Company records the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract term. Through cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses retail customers for certain costs of advertising the Companys products. The Company records these costs in Demand creation expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs. This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run. Total advertising and promotion expenses were $3,278 million , $3,213 million and $3,031 million for the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses totaled $540 million and $455 million at May 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and were recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, money market funds, time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. Short-Term Investments Short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, time deposits and corporate debt securities, with maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase. Debt securities that the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At May 31, 2016 and 2015 , the Company did not hold any short-term investments that were classified as trading or held-to-maturity. At May 31, 2016 and 2015 , Short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive income , unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at the date of purchase as current assets within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Companys short-term investments. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, net consist primarily of amounts receivable from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets . The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $43 million and $78 million at May 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, of which $17 million and $24 million , respectively, was classified as long-term and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets . Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and valued on either an average or specific identification cost basis. For inventories in transit that represent direct shipments to customers, the related inventory and cost of sales are recognized on a specific identification basis. Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Company's suppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance and logistics and other handling fees. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years. Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales . Depreciation and amortization of other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense . Software Development Costs Internal Use Software : Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 10 year period on a straight-line basis. The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed : Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test first requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the Company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, the Company measures and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any. The Company generally bases its measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that the Company expects the reporting unit to generate in the future. The Company's significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: its weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the C ompany determines that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, the Company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Operating Leases The Company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space and other non-real estate assets under operating leases. Operating lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. Rent expense for non-cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, beginning with the effective lease commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Certain leases also provide for contingent rent, which is determined as a percent of sales in excess of specified levels. A contingent rent liability is recognized together with the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable. Fair Value Measurements The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives and available-for-sale securities. Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach). The levels of hierarchy are described below: ##TABLE_START  Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. ##TABLE_END The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Pricing vendors are utilized for certain Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and that of its counterparties. The Companys fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include a comparison of fair values to another independent pricing vendor. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for additional information. Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactions Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in Total shareholders equity . The Companys global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, the impact of which is recorded in Other (income) expense, net , within the Consolidated Statements of Income. Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (a component of Total shareholders equity ), Long-term debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For designated net investment hedges, this is within the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the Companys fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives. Stock-Based Compensation The Company estimates the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted under the NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan and employees purchase rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes this fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as Operating overhead expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the vesting period using the straight-line method. Refer to Note 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for more information on the Companys stock-based compensation programs. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. United States income taxes are provided currently on financial statement earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are expected to be repatriated. The Company determines annually the amount of undistributed non-U.S. earnings to invest indefinitely in its non-U.S. operations. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense . Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes for further discussion. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards. Refer to Note 12  Earnings Per Share for further discussion. Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes to simplify the presentation of deferred taxes in the statement of financial position. The updated guidance requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 on a retrospective basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The adoption of this standard reduced Total current assets by $389 million , increased Deferred income taxes and other assets by $386 million and reduced Total current liabilities and Deferred income taxes and other liabilities by $2 million and $1 million , respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2015. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued an accounting standards update that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. The updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Based on the FASB's decision in July 2015 to defer the effective date and to allow more flexibility with implementation, the new standard will be effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018, with early application permitted. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . The updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The update to the standard is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) that replaces existing lease guidance. The new standard is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance will continue to classify leases as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of income. The standard is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2019, with early application permitted. The new standard is required to be applied with a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented with optional practical expedients. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2016, the FASB Issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The updated guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The update to the standard is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2017, with early application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_START NOTE 2  Inventories ##TABLE_ENDInventory balances of $4,838 million and $4,337 million at May 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, were substantially all finished goods. ##TABLE_START NOTE 3  Property, Plant and Equipment ##TABLE_ENDProperty, plant and equipment, net included the following: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   Land  $  $ Buildings  1,467  1,250 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software  3,510  3,329 Leasehold improvements  1,338  1,150 Construction in process   Total property, plant and equipment, gross  7,038  6,352 Less accumulated depreciation  3,518  3,341 TOTAL PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET  $ 3,520  $ 3,011 ##TABLE_ENDCapitalized interest was not material for the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . ##TABLE_START NOTE 4  Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill ##TABLE_ENDIdentifiable intangible assets, net consist of indefinite-lived trademarks, which are not subject to amortization, and acquired trademarks and other intangible assets, which are subject to amortization.

The Companys derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements that allow for the offset of assets and liabilities in the event of default or early termination of the contract. Any amounts of cash collateral received related to these instruments associated with the Company's credit-related contingent features are recorded in Cash and equivalents and Accrued liabilities , the latter of which would further offset against the Companys derivative asset balance (refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives ). Cash collateral received related to the Company's credit related contingent features is presented in the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Any amounts of non-cash collateral received, such as securities, are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets pursuant to the accounting standards for non-cash collateral received. The following tables present information about the Companys derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of May 31, 2016 and 2015 , and indicate the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the Company classifies the fair value measurement. ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, 2016   Derivative Assets  Derivative Liabilities (In millions)  Assets at Fair Value  Other Current Assets  Other Long-term Assets  Liabilities at Fair Value  Accrued Liabilities  Other Long-term Liabilities Level 2:             Foreign exchange forwards and options (1)  $  $  $  $  $  $ Embedded derivatives       Interest rate swaps (2)         TOTAL  $  $  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) If the foreign exchange derivative instruments had been netted in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the asset and liability positions each would have been reduced by $136 million as of May 31, 2016 .

No  amount of collateral was posted on the Companys derivative liability balance as of  May 31, 2015 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) As of May 31, 2015 , the Company had received $68 million of cash collateral related to its interest rate swaps. ##TABLE_ENDAvailable-for-sale securities comprise investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, money market funds, corporate commercial paper and bonds. These securities are valued using market prices on both active markets (Level 1) and less active markets (Level 2). As of May 31, 2016 , the Company held $2,113 million of available-for-sale securities with maturity dates within one year and $206 million with maturity dates over one year and less than five years within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The gross realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities were immaterial for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015 . Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities included in Other comprehensive income were immaterial as of May 31, 2016 and 2015 . The Company regularly reviews its available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment. For the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015 , the Company did not consider its securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired and accordingly, did not recognize any impairment losses. Included in Interest expense (income), net was interest income related to the Company's available-for-sale securities of $12 million , $6 million and $5 million for the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The Companys Level 3 assets comprise investments in certain non-marketable preferred stock. These Level 3 investments are an immaterial portion of the Company's portfolio. Changes in Level 3 investment assets were immaterial during the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015 . No transfers among the levels within the fair value hierarchy occurred during the years ended May 31, 2016 or 2015 . Derivative financial instruments include foreign exchange forwards and options, embedded derivatives and interest rate swaps. Refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives for additional detail. For fair value information regarding Notes payable and Long-term debt , refer to Note 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines and Note 8  Long-Term Debt , respectively. As of May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015 , assets or liabilities that were required to be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis were immaterial. At May 31, 2015 , the Company had $150 million of outstanding receivables related to its investments in reverse repurchase agreements recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying amount of these agreements approximates their fair value based upon observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2). The reverse repurchase agreements are fully collateralized. At May 31, 2016 , there were no outstanding receivables related to investments in reverse repurchase agreements. ##TABLE_START NOTE 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines ##TABLE_ENDNotes payable and interest-bearing accounts payable to Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America) as of May 31, 2016 and 2015 are summarized below: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31,     (Dollars in millions)  Borrowings  Interest Rate  Borrowings  Interest Rate Notes payable:           U.S. operations  $   0.00 % (1)   $   0.00 % (1)  Non-U.S. operations   13.00 % (1)    12.39 % (1)  TOTAL NOTES PAYABLE  $     $    Interest-bearing accounts payable:           Sojitz America  $  1.27 %   $  0.98 %  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Weighted average interest rate includes non-interest bearing overdrafts. ##TABLE_END The carrying amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for Notes payable approximate fair value. The Company purchases through Sojitz America certain NIKE Brand products it acquires from non-U.S. suppliers. These purchases are for products sold in certain countries in the Company's Emerging Markets geographic operating segment and Canada, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Accounts payable to Sojitz America are generally due up to 60 days after shipment of goods from the foreign port. The interest rate on such accounts payable is the 60 -day London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as of the beginning of the month of the invoice date, plus 0.75% . As of May 31, 2016 and 2015 , the Company had no amounts outstanding under its $2 billion commercial paper program. On August 28, 2015, the Company entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. Based on the Companys current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.455% . The facility fee is 0.045% of the total commitment. Under this committed credit facility, the Company must maintain certain financial ratios, among other things, with which the Company was in compliance at May 31, 2016 . This facility replaces the prior $1 billion credit facility agreement entered into on November 1, 2011, which would have matured November 1, 2017. No amounts were outstanding under either committed credit facility as of May 31, 2016 or 2015 . ##TABLE_START NOTE 8  Long-Term Debt ##TABLE_ENDLong-term debt , net of unamortized premiums and discounts and swap fair value adjustments, comprises the following : ##TABLE_START         Book Value Outstanding As of May 31, Scheduled Maturity (Dollars and Yen in millions)  Original Principal  Interest Rate  Interest Payments   Corporate Bond Payables: (1)           October 15, 2015 (2)  $  5.15 %  Semi-Annually  $   $ May 1, 2023 (3)  $  2.25 %  Semi-Annually   May 1, 2043 (3)  $  3.63 %  Semi-Annually   November 1, 2045 (4)  $ 1,000  3.88 %  Semi-Annually    Promissory Notes:           April 1, 2017 (5)  $  6.20 %  Monthly   January 1, 2018 (5)  $  6.79 %  Monthly    Japanese Yen Notes:           August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020 (6)   9,000  2.60 %  Quarterly   August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020 (6)   4,000  2.00 %  Quarterly   Total        2,054  1,186 Less current maturities         TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT        $ 2,010  $ 1,079 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) These senior unsecured obligations rank equally with the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby the Company receives fixed interest payments at the same rate as the note and pays variable interest payments based on the six -month LIBOR plus a spread. The swaps have the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding note. On October 15, 2015, the Company repaid the long-term debt which had previously been hedged with these interest rate swaps. Accordingly, as of May 31, 2016 , the Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) The bonds are redeemable at the Company's option prior to February 1, 2023 and November 1, 2042, respectively, at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. Subsequent to February 1, 2023 and November 1, 2042, respectively, the bonds also feature a par call provision, which allows for the bonds to be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) The bonds are redeemable at the Company's option prior to May 1, 2045, at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. Subsequent to May 1, 2045, the bonds also feature a par call provision, which allows for the bonds to be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) The Company assumed a total of $59 million in bonds payable as part of its agreement to purchase certain Corporate properties; this was treated as a non-cash financing transaction. The property serves as collateral for the debt. The purchase of these properties was accounted for as a business combination where the total consideration of $85 million was allocated to the land and buildings acquired; no other tangible or intangible assets or liabilities resulted from the purchase. The bonds mature in 2017 and 2018 and the Company does not have the ability to re-negotiate the terms of the debt agreements and would incur significant financial penalties if the notes were paid-off prior to maturity. During the year ended May 31, 2016 , the notes due January 1, 2018 were legally defeased and an insignificant loss on defeasance was recognized. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6) NIKE Logistics YK assumed a total of 13.0 billion in loans as part of its agreement to purchase a distribution center in Japan, which serves as collateral for the loans. These loans mature in equal quarterly installments during the period August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020 . ##TABLE_END The scheduled maturity of Long-term debt in each of the years ending May 31, 2017 through 2021 are $44 million , $6 million , $6 million , $6 million and $3 million , respectively, at face value. The Company's Long-term debt is recorded at adjusted cost, net of unamortized premiums and discounts and interest rate swap fair value adjustments. The fair value of Long-term debt is estimated based upon quoted prices for similar instruments or quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets (Level 2). The fair value of the Companys Long-term debt , including the current portion, was approximately $2,125 million at May 31, 2016 and $1,160 million at May 31, 2015 . ##TABLE_START NOTE 9  Income Taxes ##TABLE_ENDIncome before income taxes is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Income before income taxes:       United States  $  $ 1,967  $ 3,066 Foreign  3,667  2,238  TOTAL INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  $ 4,623  $ 4,205  $ 3,544 ##TABLE_ENDThe provision for income taxes is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Current:       United States       Federal  $  $  $ State    Foreign    Total   1,045  Deferred:       United States       Federal  (57 )  (66 )  State  (16 )  (11 )  (3 ) Foreign  (7 )  (36 )  (27 ) Total  (80 )  (113 )  (11 ) TOTAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDA reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,     Federal income tax rate  35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % State taxes, net of federal benefit  1.1 %  0.9 %  1.8 % Foreign earnings  -18.6 %  -15.7 %  2.2 % Deferred charge  0.4 %  0.9 %  -14.6 % Other, net  0.8 %  1.1 %  -0.4 % EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE  18.7 %  22.2 %  24.0 % ##TABLE_ENDThe effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2016 was 350 basis points lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside of the United States, which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. The effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2015 was 180 basis points lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2014 primarily due to the favorable resolution of audits in several jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities comprise the following:  ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   Deferred tax assets:     Allowance for doubtful accounts  $  $ Inventories   Sales return reserves   Deferred compensation   Stock-based compensation   Reserves and accrued liabilities   Net operating loss carry-forwards   Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries   Other   Total deferred tax assets  1,128  Valuation allowance  (52 )  (9 ) Total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance  1,076  Deferred tax liabilities:     Property, plant and equipment  (268 )  (220 ) Intangibles  (92 )  (93 ) Other  (4 )  (38 ) Total deferred tax liability  (364 )  (351 ) NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe following is a reconciliation of the changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)    Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of the period  $  $  $ Gross increases related to prior period tax positions (1)    Gross decreases related to prior period tax positions (1)  (20 )  (123 )  (166 ) Gross increases related to current period tax positions    Gross decreases related to current period tax positions    (9 )  (30 ) Settlements (1)  (13 )  (27 )  (676 ) Lapse of statute of limitations  (17 )  (10 )  (4 ) Changes due to currency translation  (12 )  (13 )  (4 ) UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, END OF THE PERIOD  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014, the Company reached a resolution with the IRS on a U.S. Unilateral Advanced Pricing Agreement that covers intercompany transfer pricing for fiscal years 2011 through 2020. As a result, the Company recorded a gross increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior period tax positions, a gross decrease in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior period tax positions and a settlement. The net impact of these items resulted in a decrease to unrecognized tax benefits. ##TABLE_END As of May 31, 2016 , total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were $506 million , $290 million of which would affect the Company's effective tax rate if recognized in future periods. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense . The liability for payment of interest and penalties increased by $45 million during the year ended May 31, 2016 , decreased by $3 million during the year ended May 31, 2015 and increased by $55 million during the year ended May 31, 2014 . As of May 31, 2016 and 2015 , accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $209 million and $164 million , respectively (excluding federal benefit). The Company incurs tax liabilities primarily in the United States, China and the Netherlands, as well as various state and other foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for fiscal years 2013 through 2015 . The Company has closed all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2012, with the exception of the validation of foreign tax credits utilized. During the year ended May 31, 2016, the Company received from the IRS a statutory notice of deficiency for fiscal 2012, proposing an increase in tax of $223 million , subject to interest, related to the foreign tax credit matter. The Company intends to contest this deficiency notice. As previously disclosed, the Company received a statutory notice of deficiency for fiscal 2011, proposing an increase in tax of $31 million , subject to interest, related to the foreign tax credit matter. This notice also reported a decrease in foreign tax credit carryovers for fiscal 2010 and 2011. The Company has contested this deficiency notice by filing a petition with the U.S Tax Court in April 2015. The Company does not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material impact on the financial statements. No payments on the assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved. Based on the information currently available, the Company does not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to its unrecognized tax benefits for this matter within the next 12 months. The Companys major foreign jurisdictions, China and the Netherlands, have concluded substantially all income tax matters through calendar 2005 and fiscal 2010, respectively. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in the aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $92 million within the next 12 months. The Company provides for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At May 31, 2016 , the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes have not been provided were approximately $10.7 billion . If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences of undistributed earnings would be approximately $3.6 billion at May 31, 2016 . A portion of the Company's foreign operations are benefiting from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2021 . This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The impact of this tax holiday decreased foreign taxes by $173 million , $174 million and $138 million for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on diluted earnings per common share was $0.10 , $0.10 and $0.08 for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Deferred tax assets at May 31, 2016 and 2015 were reduced by a valuation allowance relating to tax benefits of certain subsidiaries with operating losses. There was a $43 million net increase in the valuation allowance for the year ended May 31, 2016 , compared to no net change and a net increase of $4 million for the years ended May 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of $143 million at May 31, 2016 . Such losses will expire as follows:  ##TABLE_START   Year Ending May 31, (In millions)      2021-2035  Indefinite  Total Net operating losses  $  $  $  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDDuring the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , income tax benefits attributable to employee stock-based compensation transactions of $281 million , $224 million and $135 million , respectively, were allocated to Total shareholders equity . ##TABLE_START NOTE 10  Redeemable Preferred Stock ##TABLE_ENDSojitz America is the sole owner of the Companys authorized redeemable preferred stock, $1 par value, which is redeemable at the option of Sojitz America or the Company at par value aggregating $0.3 million . A cumulative dividend of $0.10 per share is payable annually on May 31 and no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock of the Company unless dividends on the redeemable preferred stock have been declared and paid in full. There have been no changes in the redeemable preferred stock in the three years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . As the holder of the redeemable preferred stock, Sojitz America does not have general voting rights, but does have the right to vote as a separate class on the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, on merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company or on the sale or assignment of the NIKE trademark for athletic footwear sold in the United States. The redeemable preferred stock has been fully issued to Sojitz America and is not blank check preferred stock. The Company's articles of incorporation do not permit the issuance of additional preferred stock. ##TABLE_START NOTE 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation ##TABLE_ENDThe authorized number of shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value, and Class B Common Stock, no par value, are 400 million and 2,400 million , respectively. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors. There are no differences in the dividend and liquidation preferences or participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shareholders. The NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the \"Stock Incentive Plan\") provides for the issuance of up to 718 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with stock options and other awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. The Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance-based awards. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the Stock Incentive Plan. The committee has the authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards and the other terms and conditions of the awards. Substantially all stock option grants outstanding under the Stock Incentive Plan are granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year, vest ratably over four years and expire ten years from the date of grant. The following table summarizes the Companys total stock-based compensation expense recognized in Operating overhead expense :  ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Stock options (1)  $  $  $ ESPPs    Restricted stock    TOTAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Expense for stock options includes the expense associated with stock appreciation rights. Accelerated stock option expense is recorded for employees eligible for accelerated stock option vesting upon retirement. Accelerated stock option expense for the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $30 million , $19 million and $15 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END As of May 31, 2016 , the Company had $245 million of unrecognized compensation costs from stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, to be recognized in Operating overhead expense over a weighted average period of 2.0 years. The weighted average fair value per share of the options granted during the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , as computed using the Black-Scholes pricing model, was $12.66 , $8.48 and $7.45 , respectively. The weighted average assumptions used to estimate these fair values are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,     Dividend yield  1.0 %  1.2 %  1.3 % Expected volatility  23.6 %  23.6 %  27.9 % Weighted average expected life (in years)  5.8  5.8  5.3 Risk-free interest rate  1.7 %  1.7 %  1.3 % ##TABLE_ENDThe Company estimates the expected volatility based on the implied volatility in market traded options on the Companys common stock with a term greater than 1 year, along with other factors. The weighted average expected life of options is based on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns. The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rate in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the options. The following summarizes the stock option transactions under the plan discussed above:  ##TABLE_START   Shares (1)  Weighted Average Option Price   (In millions)   Options outstanding May 31, 2013  135.3  $ 17.36 Exercised  (22.0 )  14.15 Forfeited  (2.5 )  24.17 Granted  16.3  31.77 Options outstanding May 31, 2014  127.1  19.64 Exercised  (27.2 )  15.39 Forfeited  (2.1 )  29.51 Granted  18.4  38.84 Options outstanding May 31, 2015  116.2  23.50 Exercised  (22.5 )  17.75 Forfeited  (2.3 )  39.96 Granted  20.6  56.41 Options outstanding May 31, 2016  112.0  $ 30.38 Options exercisable at May 31,      74.0  $ 15.71  68.6  18.26  66.5  21.48 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Includes stock appreciation rights transactions. ##TABLE_END The weighted average contractual life remaining for options outstanding and options exercisable at May 31, 2016 was 6.0 years and 4.6 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable at May 31, 2016 was $2,806 million and $2,242 million , respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value was the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of the options. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $946 million , $795 million and $474 million , respectively. In addition to the Stock Incentive Plan, the Company gives employees the right to purchase shares at a discount to the market price under employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs). Employees are eligible to participate through payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation. At the end of each 6 -month offering period, shares are purchased by the participants at 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or the end of the offering period. Employees purchased 2.5 million , 2.7 million and 2.8 million shares during each of the three years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. From time to time, the Company grants restricted stock and restricted stock units to key employees under the Stock Incentive Plan. The number of shares underlying such awards granted to employees during the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were 1 million , 0.5 million and 0.6 million , respectively, with weighted average values per share of $54.87 , $39.69 and $31.94 , respectively. Recipients of restricted stock are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respective shares throughout the period of restriction. Recipients of restricted stock units are entitled to dividend equivalent cash payments upon vesting. The value of all grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units was established by the market price on the date of grant. During the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the aggregate fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested was $49 million , $20 million and $28 million , respectively, determined as of the date of vesting. As of May 31, 2016 , the Company had $62 million of unrecognized compensation costs from restricted stock and restricted stock units to be recognized in Operating overhead expense over a weighted average period of 2.8 years. ##TABLE_START NOTE 12  Earnings Per Share ##TABLE_ENDThe following is a reconciliation from basic earnings per common share to diluted earnings per common share. The computations of diluted earnings per common share excluded options, including shares under employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs), to purchase an additional 0.2 million , 1.7 million and 1.5 million shares of common stock outstanding for the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, because the options were anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions, except per share data)    Determination of shares:       Weighted average common shares outstanding  1,697.9  1,723.5  1,766.7 Assumed conversion of dilutive stock options and awards  44.6  45.3  44.9 DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING  1,742.5  1,768.8  1,811.6        Earnings per common share:       Basic  $ 2.21  $ 1.90  $ 1.52 Diluted  $ 2.16  $ 1.85  $ 1.49 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START NOTE 13  Benefit Plans ##TABLE_ENDThe Company has a qualified 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan, in which all U.S. employees are able to participate. The Company matches a portion of employee contributions to the savings plan. Company contributions to the savings plan were $72 million , $58 million and $51 million and included in Operating overhead expense for the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The terms of the plan also allow for annual discretionary profit sharing contributions, as determined by the Board of Directors, to the accounts of eligible U.S. employees who work at least 1,000 hours in a year. Profit sharing contributions of $64 million , $58 million and $49 million were made to the plan and included in Operating overhead expense for the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The Company also has a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) that was adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by shareholders in September 1997 and later amended in fiscal 2007. The Company recognized $85 million , $68 million and $46 million of Operating overhead expense related to cash awards under the LTIP during the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The Company allows certain highly compensated employees and non-employee directors of the Company to defer compensation under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Deferred compensation plan liabilities were $475 million and $443 million at May 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and primarily classified as long-term in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities . The Company has pension plans in various countries worldwide. The pension plans are only available to local employees and are generally government mandated. The liability related to the unfunded pension liabilities of the plans was $93 million and $98 million at May 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and primarily classified as long-term in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities . ##TABLE_START NOTE 14  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ##TABLE_ENDThe changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income , net of tax, were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In millions)  Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment (1)(2)  Cash Flow Hedges  Net Investment Hedges (1)(2)  Other  Total Balance at May 31, 2015  $ (31 )  $ 1,220  $  $ (58 )  $ 1,246 Other comprehensive gains (losses) before reclassifications (3)  (178 )  (47 )     (219 ) Reclassifications to net income of previously deferred (gains) losses (4)   (710 )    (1 )  (709 ) Other comprehensive income (loss)  (176 )  (757 )     (928 ) Balance at May 31, 2016  $ (207 )  $  $  $ (53 )  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment and net investment hedge gains/losses related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary are reclassified to Net income upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the respective entity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Beginning balances have been updated to reflect the proper classification of $20 million of deferred tax balances between Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment and Net Investment Hedges. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Net of tax benefit (expense) of $ 0 million , $ 28 million , $ 0 million , $ (2) million and $ 26 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Net of tax (benefit) expense of $ 0 million , $ 7 million , $ 0 million , $ 2 million and $ 9 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (In millions)  Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment (1)(2)  Cash Flow Hedges  Net Investment Hedges (1)(2)  Other  Total Balance at May 31, 2014  $ (11 )  $  $  $ (51 )  $ Other comprehensive gains (losses) before reclassifications (3)  (20 )  1,447     1,460 Reclassifications to net income of previously deferred (gains) losses (4)    (259 )    (40 )  (299 ) Other comprehensive income (loss)  (20 )  1,188    (7 )  1,161 Balance at May 31, 2015  $ (31 )  $ 1,220  $  $ (58 )  $ 1,246 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment and net investment hedge gains/losses related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary are reclassified to Net income upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the respective entity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Beginning and ending balances have been updated to reflect the proper classification of $20 million of deferred tax balances between Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment and Net Investment Hedges. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Net of tax benefit (expense) of $ 0 million , $ (33) million , $ 0 million , $ 0 million and $ (33) million , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Net of tax (benefit) expense of $ 0 million , $ 2 million , $ 0 million , $ 0 million and $ 2 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the reclassifications from Accumulated other comprehensive income to the Consolidated Statements of Income: ##TABLE_START   Amount of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income     Year Ended May 31, (In millions)   Gains (losses) on foreign currency translation adjustment  $ (2 )  $  Other (income) expense, net Total before tax  (2 )    Tax (expense) benefit      Gain (loss) net of tax  (2 )    Gains (losses) on cash flow hedges:      Foreign exchange forwards and options  (88 )  (95 ) Revenues Foreign exchange forwards and options   Cost of sales Foreign exchange forwards and options     Total selling and administrative expense Foreign exchange forwards and options   Other (income) expense, net Total before tax    Tax (expense) benefit  (7 )  (2 )  Gain (loss) net of tax    Gains (losses) on other   Other (income) expense, net Total before tax    Tax (expense) benefit  (2 )    Gain (loss) net of tax    Total net gain (loss) reclassified for the period  $  $  ##TABLE_ENDRefer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Company's risk management program and derivatives. ##TABLE_START NOTE 15  Commitments and Contingencies ##TABLE_ENDThe Company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, and office space and other non-real estate assets under operating leases expiring from 1 to 18 years after May 31, 2016 .

These letters of credit were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and guarantees of the Companys performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. In connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the Companys historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of its pending legal matters with certainty, the Company does not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ##TABLE_START NOTE 16  Risk Management and Derivatives ##TABLE_ENDThe Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2016 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs . All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date.

Cash Flow Hedges The purpose of the Company's foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency exposures that the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external and intercompany revenues, selling and administrative expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions. Product cost exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below. NIKE entities primarily purchase products in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities  purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a wholly owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the product to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. The Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the Company's existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, the Companys payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order. Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below. The Companys policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $11.5 billion as of May 31, 2016 . As of May 31, 2016 , the Company had a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a total outstanding notional amount of $1.5 billion . These instruments were designated as cash flow hedges of the variability in the expected cash outflows of interest payments on future debt due to changes in benchmark interest rates. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company terminated certain forward-starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $1 billion in connection with the October 29, 2015 debt issuance (refer to Note 8  Long-Term Debt ). Upon termination of these forward-starting swaps, the Company received a cash payment from the related counterparties of $34 million , which was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income and will be released through Interest expense (income), net as interest payments are made over the term of the issued debt. All changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, excluding any ineffective portion, are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income until Net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. In most cases, amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income will be released to Net income in periods following the maturity of the related derivative, rather than at maturity. Effective hedge results are classified within the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure. The results of hedges of non-functional currency denominated revenues and product cost exposures, excluding embedded derivatives, are recorded in Revenues or Cost of sales when the underlying hedged transaction affects consolidated Net income . Results of hedges of selling and administrative expense are recorded together with those costs when the related expense is recorded. Amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income related to forward-starting interest rate swaps will be released through Interest expense (income), net as interest payments are made over the term of the issued debt. Results of hedges of anticipated purchases and sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities are recorded in  Other (income) expense, net  when the securities are sold. Results of hedges of certain anticipated intercompany transactions are recorded in Other (income) expense, net  when the transaction occurs. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from these designated cash flow hedge derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Premiums paid or received on options are initially recorded as deferred charges or deferred credits, respectively. The Company assesses the effectiveness of options based on the total cash flows method and records total changes in the options fair value to Accumulated other comprehensive income to the degree they are effective. The Company formally assesses, both at a hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Effectiveness for cash flow hedges is assessed based on changes in forward rates . Ineffectiveness was 0 billion for the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when: (1) it determines that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item (including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions); (2) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; (3) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, but is expected to occur within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in Accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified to Net income when the forecasted transaction affects consolidated Net income . However, if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were in Accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in Other (income) expense, net . In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry the derivative at its fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, recognizing future changes in the fair value in Other (income) expense, net . For the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the amounts recorded in Other (income) expense, net as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedging because the forecasted transaction was no longer probable of occurring were immaterial . As of May 31, 2016 , $460 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income . Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2016 , the maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 24 months. Fair Value Hedges The Company is also exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. The cash flows associated with the Companys fair value hedges are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding, which are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 or 2014 . On October 15, 2015, the Company repaid the long-term debt which had previously been hedged with these interest rate swaps. Accordingly, a s of May 31, 2016 , the Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges. Net Investment Hedges The Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign-currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges, except ineffective portions, are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its net investment hedges within the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness based on changes in forward rates. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from net investment hedges for the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 or 2014 . The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2016 . Undesignated Derivative Instruments The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and/or the embedded derivative contracts. These forwards are not designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, these undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net , together with the re-measurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position or embedded derivative contract. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from undesignated instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $7.1 billion as of May 31, 2016 . Embedded Derivatives As part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related purchase order and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net , from the date a purchase order is accepted by a factory through the date the purchase price is no longer subject to foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts. These payment terms expose NIKE to variability in foreign exchange rates and create embedded derivative contracts that must be bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as derivative assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding changes in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net until each payment is settled. At May 31, 2016 , the notional amount of all embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $282 million . Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. However, this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored. The Companys derivative contracts contain credit risk related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Companys bilateral credit related contingent features generally require the owing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of  $50 million  should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than  $50 million . Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also trigger collateral requirements. As of May 31, 2016 , the Company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features and had derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position of $3 million . Accordingly, the Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features. Further, as of May 31, 2016 , the Company had received $105 million of cash collateral from various counterparties to its derivative contracts (refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements ). Given the considerations described above, the Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be  immaterial . ##TABLE_START NOTE 17  Operating Segments and Related Information ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Companys NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company, and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Global Brand Divisions is included within the NIKE Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. Global Brand Divisions primarily represent NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment, and demand creation, operating overhead and product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand. Corporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to the Companys headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses. The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (commonly referred to as EBIT), which represents Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entitys functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses. Accounts receivable, net , Inventories and Property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below. Additions to long-lived assets as presented in the following table represent capital expenditures. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2016 presentation. ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    REVENUES       North America  $ 14,764  $ 13,740  $ 12,299 Western Europe  5,884  5,705  4,979 Central  Eastern Europe  1,431  1,421  1,387 Greater China  3,785  3,067  2,602 Japan    Emerging Markets  3,701  3,898  3,949 Global Brand Divisions    Total NIKE Brand  30,507  28,701  26,112 Converse  1,955  1,982  1,684 Corporate  (86 )  (82 )  TOTAL NIKE CONSOLIDATED REVENUES  $ 32,376  $ 30,601  $ 27,799 EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES       North America  $ 3,763  $ 3,645  $ 3,077 Western Europe  1,434  1,275  Central  Eastern Europe    Greater China  1,372   Japan    Emerging Markets    Global Brand Divisions  (2,596 )  (2,267 )  (1,993 ) Total NIKE Brand  5,328  4,813  4,117 Converse    Corporate  (1,173 )  (1,097 )  (1,036 ) Total NIKE Consolidated Earnings Before Interest and Taxes  4,642  4,233  3,577 Interest expense (income), net    TOTAL NIKE CONSOLIDATED INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  $ 4,623  $ 4,205  $ 3,544 ADDITIONS TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS       North America  $  $  $ Western Europe    Central  Eastern Europe    Greater China    Japan    Emerging Markets    Global Brand Divisions    Total NIKE Brand    Converse    Corporate    TOTAL ADDITIONS TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS  $ 1,191  $ 1,003  $ DEPRECIATION       North America  $  $  $ Western Europe    Central  Eastern Europe    Greater China    Japan    Emerging Markets    Global Brand Divisions    Total NIKE Brand    Converse    Corporate    TOTAL DEPRECIATION  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET     North America  $ 1,689  $ 1,737 Western Europe   Central  Eastern Europe   Greater China   Japan   Emerging Markets   Global Brand Divisions   Total NIKE Brand  2,949  3,090 Converse   Corporate   TOTAL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET  $ 3,241  $ 3,358 INVENTORIES     North America  $ 2,363  $ 2,207 Western Europe   Central  Eastern Europe   Greater China   Japan   Emerging Markets   Global Brand Divisions   Total NIKE Brand  4,536  3,978 Converse   Corporate  (4 )  TOTAL INVENTORIES  $ 4,838  $ 4,337 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET     North America  $  $ Western Europe   Central  Eastern Europe   Greater China   Japan   Emerging Markets   Global Brand Divisions   Total NIKE Brand  2,458  2,176 Converse   Corporate   TOTAL PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET  $ 3,520  $ 3,011 ##TABLE_ENDRevenues by Major Product Lines Revenues to external customers for NIKE Brand products are attributable to sales of footwear, apparel and equipment.

Business ##TABLE_START General ##TABLE_END NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the State of Oregon. As used in this report, the terms we, us, NIKE, and the Company refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise.

Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores, internet websites, and mobile applications (which we refer to collectively as our Direct to Consumer or DTC operations), and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees throughout the world. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment products are produced both in the United States and abroad. ##TABLE_START Products ##TABLE_END We focus our NIKE Brand product offerings in nine key categories: Running, NIKE Basketball, the Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Mens Training, Womens Training, Action Sports, Sportswear (our sports-inspired lifestyle products) and Golf. Men's Training includes our baseball and American football product offerings. We also market products designed for kids, as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as cricket, lacrosse, tennis, volleyball, wrestling, walking and outdoor activities. NIKEs athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products. Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand are currently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales. We also sell sports apparel covering the above-mentioned categories, which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use and exemplifies our commitment to innovation and high-quality construction. Sportswear, Mens Training and Running are currently our top-selling apparel categories and we expect them to continue to lead in apparel sales. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in collections of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos. We sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc., doing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation. Our Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results for Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. One of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Hurley, headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the Hurley trademark. Sales and operating results for Hurley products are included within the NIKE Brand's North America geographic operating segment with sales reported within the Action Sports category. Another of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis. In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our DTC operations, we have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities. ##TABLE_START Sales and Marketing ##TABLE_END Financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in Note 17  Operating Segments and Related Information of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, operating and logistics-related factors. Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors. We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. For fiscal 2017, our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets. In June 2017, we announced a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. As a result of this organizational realignment, beginning in fiscal 2018, the Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand will be: North America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific and Latin America. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are, and will continue to be, managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is, and will continue to be, a reportable segment and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Converse Direct to Consumer operations, including digital commerce, are reported within the Converse operating segment results. ##TABLE_START United States Market ##TABLE_ENDFor fiscal 2017 , NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 46% of total revenues, compared to 47% and 46% for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 , respectively. We sell our NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to thousands of retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit such sales. During fiscal 2017 , our three largest customers accounted for approximately 23% of sales in the United States. Our Direct to Consumer operations sell NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to consumers through our digital commerce website, www.nike.com and through mobile applications. In addition, our Direct to Consumer operations sell through the following number of retail stores in the United States: ##TABLE_START U.S. Retail Stores Number NIKE Brand factory stores NIKE Brand in-line stores (including employee-only stores) Converse stores (including factory stores) Hurley stores (including factory and employee stores) TOTAL ##TABLE_ENDIn the United States, NIKE has six significant distribution centers located in Memphis, Tennessee, two of which are owned and four of which are leased. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our leased Foothill Ranch, California distribution center. Converse and Hurley products are shipped primarily from leased facilities in Ontario, California, as well as from Memphis, Tennessee. Smaller leased distribution facilities are located in various parts of the United States. We also operate a futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price. For fiscal 2017 , orders under the futures program represented 83% of our U.S. wholesale footwear revenues, compared to 84% for fiscal 2016 and 87% for fiscal 2015 . For fiscal 2017 , futures orders represented 66% of our U.S. wholesale apparel revenues, compared to 66% for fiscal 2016 and 67% for fiscal 2015 . ##TABLE_START International Markets ##TABLE_ENDFor fiscal 2017 , non-U.S. NIKE Brand and Converse sales accounted for 54% of total revenues, compared to 53% and 54% for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 , respectively. We sell our products to retail accounts, through our own Direct to Consumer operations and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives around the world. We sell to thousands of retail accounts and ship products from 60 distribution centers outside of the United States. In many countries and regions, including Canada, Asia, Europe and some Latin American countries, we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the United States futures ordering program described above. During fiscal 2017 , NIKEs three largest customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 12% of total non-U.S. sales. In addition to NIKE and Converse owned digital commerce websites in over 45 countries, our Direct to Consumer business operates the following number of retail stores outside the United States: ##TABLE_START Non-U.S. Retail Stores Number NIKE Brand factory stores NIKE Brand in-line stores (including employee-only stores) Converse stores (including factory stores) TOTAL ##TABLE_ENDInternational branch offices and subsidiaries of NIKE are located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Macau, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and Vietnam. ##TABLE_START Significant Customer ##TABLE_ENDNo customer accounted for 10% or more of our worldwide net revenues during fiscal 2017 . ##TABLE_START Orders ##TABLE_ENDFutures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2017 were $14.7 billion compared to $15.0 billion for the same period last year. NIKE Brand futures orders include (1) orders from external wholesale customers and (2) internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations which are reflected at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. The U.S. Dollar futures orders amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the actual currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period and have become less correlated due to our evolving business model. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and orders with shorter lead times, and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. A portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales with short lead times, closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, all sales of NIKE Brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations, and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley. ##TABLE_START Product Research, Design and Development ##TABLE_ENDWe believe our research, design and development efforts are key factors in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort while reducing waste. In addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs, materials, concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process. As we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories. Using market intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumer preferences. The proliferation of NIKE Air, Lunar, Zoom, Free, Flywire, Dri-Fit, Flyknit, Flyweave, ZoomX, React and NIKE+ technologies throughout our Running, NIKE Basketball, the Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Men's Training, Women's Training and Sportswear categories, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products. ##TABLE_START Manufacturing ##TABLE_ENDWe are supplied by approximately 127 footwear factories located in 15 countries. The largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 8% of total fiscal 2017 NIKE Brand footwear production. Virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers who often operate multiple factories. For fiscal 2017 , contract factories in Vietnam, China and Indonesia manufactured approximately 46%, 27% and 21% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. We also have manufacturing agreements with independent contract manufacturers in Argentina, India, Brazil, Mexico and Italy to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. For fiscal 2017 , five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 69% of NIKE Brand footwear production. We are supplied by approximately 363 apparel factories located in 37 countries. The largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 13% of total fiscal 2017 NIKE Brand apparel production. Virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories. For fiscal 2017 , contract factories in China, Vietnam and Thailand produced approximately 26%, 16% and 10% of total NIKE Brand apparel, respectively. For fiscal 2017 , one apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more than 10% of apparel production, and the top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 43% of NIKE Brand apparel production. The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and canvas, as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2017 , Air Manufacturing Innovation, with facilities near Beaverton, Oregon and in St. Charles, Missouri, as well as independent contractors in China and Vietnam, were our suppliers of the Air-Sole cushioning components used in footwear. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads (both virgin and recycled); specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware. NIKEs independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. NIKE's independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products. Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed significant import-export financing services for us. During fiscal 2017 , Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, South Africa, Thailand and Uruguay, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 6% of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates. Our current agreements with Sojitz America expire on May 31, 2018 and contain a provision allowing us to extend the agreements to May 31, 2019. ##TABLE_START International Operations and Trade ##TABLE_ENDOur international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as possible increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future. In recent years, uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional measures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole. We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. Current U.S. policy proposals, including potential tariffs or penalties on imported goods, if enacted, may negatively affect U.S. corporations with production activities outside the U.S., including NIKE. There have also been discussions and commentary regarding potential changes to U.S. trade policies. If any of these reforms are implemented, it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business which may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition , with respect to trade restrictions targeting China, which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us, we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules and (iii) reflects and considers China's domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community. Where trade protection measures are implemented, we believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability. NIKE advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements. ##TABLE_START Competition ##TABLE_ENDThe athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment, including adidas, ASICS, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, Puma, Under Armour and V.F. Corporation, among others. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. Important aspects of competition in this industry are: ##TABLE_START  Product attributes such as quality; performance and reliability; new product innovation and development and consumer price/value. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consumer connection and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing and promotion; social media interaction; customer support and service; identification with prominent and influential athletes, public figures, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and online. ##TABLE_END We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas. ##TABLE_START Trademarks and Patents ##TABLE_ENDWe believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success, and our competitive position. We pursue available protections of these rights and vigorously protect them against third-party theft and infringement. We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have sought and obtained trademark registrations. We have copyright protection in our design, graphics and other original works. In some instances, we also obtain registered copyrights. We own patents and have a patent license, facilitating our use of Air technologies. We file for, own and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility patents, as well as many U.S. and foreign design patents protecting components, technologies, manufacturing techniques, features and industrial design used in various athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, athletic equipment and digital devices. These patents expire at various times. We believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patent and trade secret positions. However, we have followed a policy of filing patent applications for the United States and select foreign countries on inventions, designs and improvements that we deem valuable. We also continue to vigorously protect our trademarks and patents against third-party infringement. ##TABLE_START Employees ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2017 , we had approximately 74,400 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. Management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent. None of our employees are represented by a union, except for certain employees in the Emerging Markets geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into and/or comply with industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements. ##TABLE_START Executive Officers of the Registrant ##TABLE_ENDThe executive officers of NIKE, Inc. as of July 20, 2017 are as follows: Mark G.

", "1A": " ITEM 1A. Risk Factors Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Analyst Reports Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historic information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKEs business plans, objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports, filings with the SEC, press releases, conferences or otherwise, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain the words believe, anticipate, expect, estimate, project, will be, will continue, will likely result or words or phrases of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the SEC, including reports filed on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, and include, among others, the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear, apparel and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products; difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for NIKE products and the various market factors described above; difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining NIKEs increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control; interruptions in data and information technology systems; consumer data security; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance futures orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes in shipment timing, the changing mix of futures and orders with shorter lead times, and discounts, order cancellations and returns; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKEs products; increases in the cost of materials, labor and energy used to manufacture products; new product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; product performance and quality; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors and licensees; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in NIKEs debt ratings; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, including, without limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas, political and economic instability and terrorism; proposed changes to U.S. tax laws or policy, tariff and import/export regulations; changes in government regulations; the impact of, including business and legal developments relating to, climate change and natural disasters; litigation, regulatory proceedings and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the effects of NIKEs decision to invest in or divest of businesses and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKEs business and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks, nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on NIKEs business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKEs policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE. Our products face intense competition. NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products. Our DTC operations, both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores, also compete with multi-brand retailers selling our products. Product offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, customer service, digital commerce platforms and social media presence are areas of intense competition. This, in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. In addition, the competitive nature of retail including shifts in the ways in which consumers are shopping, and the rising trend of digital commerce, constitutes a risk factor implicating our DTC and wholesale operations. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly. Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business. Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, product innovation and product quality. Our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design (including materials) and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity. In addition, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns. Negative posts or comments about us on social networking applications or websites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image. If we do not maintain, extend and expand our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits. Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media, mobile applications and online advertising. If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our products. Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products. Research and development play a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting-edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could harm our business. We establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, as well as other public figures, to develop, evaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with consumers. However, as competition in our industry has increased, the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased. If we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, or other public figures, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the high visibility or on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. As a result, our brands, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be harmed. Furthermore, if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues, or other endorsers, associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues, or endorsers, could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes, or public figures, to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes, public figures, and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings. A majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States. As a result, we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates globally. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdom's impending exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit and current U.S. policy proposals. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities. Global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world, most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies. If global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition: ##TABLE_START  Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts, increased inventories and lower gross margins. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We conduct transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies, including in response to certain policies advocated by the U.S. presidential administration, could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum derivatives) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products. ##TABLE_END Our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events, such as the Olympics or the European Football Championship, among others. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, availability of import quotas, transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues. We utilize a futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price. Our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory, purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. We currently report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports. Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for any future period, and the relationship between reported futures and reported revenues in a given period has become less correlated over time based on our evolving business model. Differences are also due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and orders with shorter lead times and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales with short lead times, closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, all sales of NIKE Brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our Direct to Consumer in-line stores and digital commerce operations, and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley. Our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins, reduced cash flows and harm to our business. We purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer, distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance. We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers. We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products. Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products. The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retailers with many stores. These retailers have in the past increased their market share by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. These situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity or consumer behavior shifts away from traditional retail, it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. In addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues. Our Direct to Consumer operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Our Direct to Consumer stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our Direct to Consumer operations, a decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and-mortar retail, or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs. Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Companys control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud; mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation. In addition, extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business. If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected. Many of our customers shop with us through our digital commerce website and mobile applications. Increasingly, customers are using tablets and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers' brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands. Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business. We periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products. The actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others. We also may be unable to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights. We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, use, importation and/or sale of certain products. We take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights. Such actions include contractual measures such as entering into non-disclosure and non-compete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties, and providing confidential information awareness training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective. For example, confidential information that is related to business strategy, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, a decline in our stock price and/or a negative impact on our market position, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties or injunctions. In addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, including outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. We are subject to the risk that our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands. We currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. If our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships, supplier relationships or credit risks, it could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. We also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees. The misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us. We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results, operations or reputation. In addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information, we collect transactional and personal information about our customers and users of our digital experiences, which include online distribution channels and product engagement and personal fitness applications. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Any breach of our network, or vendor systems, may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data, misappropriation of our consumers, users' or employees personal information or a disruption of our business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, including, unwanted media attention, impairment of our consumer and customer relationships, damage to our reputation and result in lost sales and consumers, fines, or lawsuits. We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to and/or redress problems caused by any breach. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data. Compliance with existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly, and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits. Failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct, local laws and other standards could harm our business. We work with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to manufacture our products, and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property. We require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental, health and safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety. Notwithstanding their contractual obligations, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business. Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products. This includes, for example, the uncertainty surrounding the effect of Brexit, including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union, as well as the current proposals affecting trade policy in the U.S. The U.S. presidential administration has indicated a focus on policy reforms that discourage U.S. corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions, including through potential tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the U.S. If any of these reforms are implemented, it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business which may adversely affect our results of operations. The administration has also targeted the specific practices of certain U.S. multinational corporations in public statements which, if directed at us, could harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business. In addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or additional tax liabilities. We are subject to the tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction, including the United States, subject to significant change. There have been proposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows. We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions. If our capital or financing needs in the United States require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels, our effective income tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted. Portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings that expire in whole or in part from time to time. These tax holidays and rulings may be extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not met. If the tax holidays and rulings are not extended, or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate, our effective income tax rate would increase in the future. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates. Proposed changes to U.S. tax law or policy, tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During, and following, the recent U.S. presidential election, there has been discussion and commentary regarding potential significant changes to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including NAFTA and trade policies and tariffs affecting China. There have also been discussions of a disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products. It is unknown at this time whether and to what extent new legislation will be passed into law, pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted, international trade agreements will be negotiated, or the effect that any such action would have, either positively or negatively, on our industry, or on us. The Company, similar to many other multinational corporations, does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by these changes. If any new legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated, it may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with such changes. Such operational changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. As part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterpartys liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. We rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products. NIKE is supplied by approximately 127 footwear factories located in 15 countries. We do not own or operate any of our own footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell. In fiscal 2017 , five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of fiscal 2017 footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69% of NIKE Brand footwear production in fiscal 2017 . Our ability to meet our customers' needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers. If one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship, we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing. The principal materials used in our apparel products  natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat or repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware  are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. The principal materials used in our footwear products  natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, nylon, canvas and polyurethane films  are also locally available to manufacturers. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate, train, employ and retain adequate personnel. NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured. There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all. Further, our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future, unexpected increases in work wages, whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short- and long-term. Because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers, could adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air freight, which could adversely affect our profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins. Current U.S. trade policy proposals, including potential changes to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could also have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions, and could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, Sojitz America performs significant import-export financing services for the Company. During fiscal 2017, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Canada, India, South Africa and Thailand (collectively the Sojitz Markets), excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the Sojitz Markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. Our success depends on our global distribution facilities. We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, particularly in emerging markets, depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities. We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. We are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party services (Information Technology Systems), across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities. Information Technology Systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems. Over a number of years, we have implemented Information Technology Systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Our work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to invest in these efforts. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions or other causes, or failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade systems, or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. We also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans, or those of our vendors, do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. Furthermore, we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection and use for digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Any interruption in Information Technology Systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss of users. The market for prime real estate is competitive. Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, both domestically and internationally, depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases. In addition, from time to time, we seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition or close some of our real estate locations, which may require modification of an existing lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, customers, distribution centers and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. From time to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses, product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses, such as our digital commerce operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost-effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. However, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business. The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. We are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world, we are involved in various types of claims, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business, our products and the actions of our employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties, or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation. The global nature of our business means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time, which could adversely affect us. In addition, any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business. Our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business. Our future success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. The sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock. As of June 30, 2017, Swoosh, LLC beneficially owned more than 78% of our Class A Common Stock. If, on June 30, 2017, all of these shares were converted into Class B Common Stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 16%. The shares are available for resale, subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H. Knight, our Chairman Emeritus, to hold the majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock. On June 30, 2016, Mr. Knight sold his voting interest in Swoosh, LLC to a trust controlled by his son and NIKE director, Travis Knight. Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options. Our long-term debt is currently rated Investment Grade by Standard  Poors and Moodys Investors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default, and as a result, the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt. If our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results could be adversely affected. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, contingent payments under endorsement contracts, accounting for property, plant and equipment and definite-lived assets, hedge accounting for derivatives, stock-based compensation, income taxes and other contingencies. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock. Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock. There are provisions of our articles of incorporation and Oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, a freeze-out statute, two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company. We may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline. Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts estimates of our future performance. Analysts estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stock price is volatile for any reason, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in reputational damage, substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. ", "2": " ITEM 2. Properties The following is a summary of principal properties owned or leased by NIKE: The NIKE World Campus, owned by NIKE and located near Beaverton, Oregon, USA, is a 400-acre site consisting of over 40 buildings which, together with adjacent leased properties, functions as our world headquarters and is occupied by approximately 10,800 employees engaged in management, research, design, development, marketing, finance and other administrative functions serving nearly all of our divisions. We also lease various office facilities in the surrounding metropolitan area. We lease a similar, but smaller, administrative facility in Hilversum, the Netherlands, which serves as the headquarters for the Western Europe and Central  Eastern Europe geographies and management of certain brand functions for our non-U.S. operations. We also lease an office complex in Shanghai, China, our headquarters for Greater China, occupied by employees focused on implementing our wholesale, DTC and merchandising strategies in the region, among other functions. In the United States, NIKE has six significant distribution centers located in Memphis, Tennessee, two of which are owned and four are leased. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California distribution center, which we lease. Smaller leased distribution facilities are located in various parts of the United States. We also own or lease distribution and customer service facilities outside the United States. The most significant are the distribution facilities located in Laakdal, Belgium; Taicang, China; Tomisato, Japan and Incheon, Korea, all of which we own. Air Manufacturing Innovation manufactures Air-Sole cushioning components at NIKE-owned facilities and one leased facility located near Beaverton, Oregon and in St. Charles, Missouri. Air Manufacturing Innovation also manufactures and sells small amounts of various other plastic products to other manufacturers. Aside from the principal properties described above, we lease many offices worldwide for sales and administrative purposes. We lease approximately 1,141 retail stores worldwide, which consist primarily of factory outlet stores. See United States Market and International Markets in Part I of this Report. Our leases expire at various dates through the year 2033. ", "3": " ITEM 3.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned in-line and factory retail stores and NIKE-owned internet websites and mobile applications (which we refer to collectively as our Direct to Consumer or DTC operations), and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, must have products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail, online and through mobile applications. In June 2017, we announced the Consumer Direct Offense, a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. Leveraging the power of digital, NIKE will drive growth  by accelerating innovation and product creation, moving even closer to the consumer through key cities, and deepening one-to-one connections. In addition to achieving long-term, sustainable revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas: ##TABLE_START  Expanding gross margin by: ##TABLE_END - Delivering innovative, premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a balanced price-to-value equation for consumers; - Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation; - Making our supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation, help reduce waste and have long-term potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market; and - Driving growth in our higher gross margin DTC business, led by digital commerce, as part of an integrated marketplace growth strategy across our DTC and wholesale operations. ##TABLE_START  Optimizing selling and administrative expense by focusing on: ##TABLE_END - Investments in consumer engagement that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit; - Infrastructure investments that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations; and - Investments in key areas of future growth, including our DTC business. ##TABLE_START  Managing working capital efficiency; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Deploying capital effectively. ##TABLE_END Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2020, on average per year, are as follows: ##TABLE_START  High single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Mid-teens earnings per share growth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  High-twenties to low-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Free cash flow growing faster than net income; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sustainable, profitable, long-term growth through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. ##TABLE_END Over the past ten years, we have achieved many of our financial goals. During this time, revenues and diluted earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc., inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, have grown 8% and 13%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. We expanded gross margin by approximately 70 basis points, and our return on invested capital has increased from 21.9% to 34.7%. On November 19, 2015, we announced a two -for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2015. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 24, 2015. All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. Our fiscal 2017 results demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to deliver continued growth and expanding profitability. Despite foreign currency headwinds, we achieved record revenues and earnings per share for fiscal 2017. NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 6% to $34.4 billion, Net income increased 13% and diluted earnings per common share grew 16% to $2.51. We also delivered strong cash returns to shareholders while investing for long-term growth. Earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) increased 7% for fiscal 2017, driven by revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage, partially offset by gross margin contraction. The increase in revenues was driven by growth across all NIKE Brand geographies and Converse, footwear and apparel, and several key categories. This broad-based growth was primarily fueled by: ##TABLE_START  Innovative performance and sportswear products, incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE Air, Free, Zoom, Lunar, Flywire, Dri-Fit and Flyknit; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Deep brand connections with consumers through our category offense, reinforced by investments in endorsements by high-profile athletes, sports teams and leagues, high-impact marketing around global sporting events and digital marketing; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Strong category retail presentation through digital commerce and NIKE-owned and retail partner stores. ##TABLE_END NIKE, Inc. gross margin decreased 160 basis points primarily due to higher product costs and foreign currency exchange rate headwinds, which more than offset higher full-price average selling price (ASP). At current rates, we anticipate foreign currency exchange rate headwinds will continue to negatively impact gross margin and Net income in fiscal 2018. Converse revenues increased 4% and EBIT declined 2%, as growth in direct distribution markets and lower selling and administrative expense were more than offset by lower gross margin, primarily a result of the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs, as well as the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues primarily due to market transitions. For fiscal 2017, the growth in Net income was positively affected by a year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate of 550 basis points primarily due to a one-time benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the United States. Diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate than Net income due to a 3% decrease in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program. While foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no Direct to Consumer operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our Direct to Consumer operations, which are charged at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. Additionally, currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company  s performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. However, references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. ##TABLE_START Results of Operations ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data)  Fiscal 2017  Fiscal 2016  % Change  Fiscal 2015  % Change Revenues  $ 34,350  $ 32,376  %  $ 30,601  % Cost of sales  19,038  17,405  %  16,534  % Gross profit  15,312  14,971  %  14,067  % Gross margin  44.6 %  46.2 %    46.0 %   Demand creation expense  3,341  3,278  %  3,213  % Operating overhead expense  7,222  7,191  %  6,679  % Total selling and administrative expense  10,563  10,469  %  9,892  % % of revenues  30.8 %  32.3 %    32.3 %   Interest expense (income), net        Other (income) expense, net  (196 )  (140 )    (58 )   Income before income taxes  4,886  4,623  %  4,205  % Income tax expense    %   % Effective tax rate  13.2 %  18.7 %    22.2 %   NET INCOME  $ 4,240  $ 3,760  %  $ 3,273  % Diluted earnings per common share  $ 2.51  $ 2.16  %  $ 1.85  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Consolidated Operating Results ##TABLE_ENDRevenues ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 (1) % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes (2) Fiscal 2015 (1) % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes (2) NIKE, Inc.

Revenues grew 8% for fiscal 2017, primarily driven by higher revenues for the NIKE Brand and Converse. All NIKE Brand geographies delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2017 as our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers online and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores, driving demand for NIKE Brand products. Revenue growth was broad-based as Greater China, Western Europe, Emerging Markets and North America each contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. Revenues . On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 8% and 9%, respectively, for fiscal 2017, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 3%. On a category basis, the increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues was driven by strong growth in Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2017 increased 7%, with higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 1 percentage point of footwear revenue growth, primarily driven by higher full-price and off-price ASPs, partially offset by the impact of higher off-price sales. The constant-currency increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2017 was fueled by growth in several key categories, most notably Sportswear, Mens Training and Running. Unit sales of apparel increased 6%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and, to a lesser extent, growth in our higher-priced DTC business. While wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to expand our DTC businesses in each of our geographies. Our NIKE Brand DTC operations include NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores, as well as NIKE-owned digital commerce. For fiscal 2017, DTC revenues represented approximately 28% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 26% for fiscal 2016. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues increased 18% for fiscal 2017, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 30%, the addition of new stores and 7% comparable store sales growth. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. On a reported basis, digital commerce sales through NIKE-owned websites and mobile applications, which are not included in comparable store sales, were $2.2 billion for fiscal 2017 compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2016 and represented approximately 24% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2017 compared to 22% for fiscal 2016. On a wholesale equivalent and currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2017 NIKE Brand Mens revenues increased 6%, driven by significant growth in Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand, while Women's revenues increased 8%, led by growth in Sportswear and Running. Revenues for our Young Athletes' business increased 8%, with growth across multiple categories, most notably the Jordan Brand. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015  On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 12% for fiscal 2016, primarily driven by higher revenues for the NIKE Brand. Every NIKE Brand geography grew revenues for fiscal 2016. North America contributed approximately 4 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. Revenues , while Greater China and Western Europe each contributed approximately 3 percentage points, Emerging Markets contributed approximately 2 percentage points and Central  Eastern Europe contributed approximately 1 percentage point. On a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 15% and 11%, respectively, for fiscal 2016, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 2%. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2016 was driven by growth in nearly every key category, including strong growth in Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2016 increased 9%, with higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 6 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was driven by higher full-price ASP, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business. The constant-currency increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2016 was attributable to growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Mens Training, Running, Womens Training and Football (Soccer). Apparel unit sales for fiscal 2016 increased 7%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and growth in our higher-priced DTC business. For fiscal 2016, DTC revenues represented approximately 26% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 23% in fiscal 2015. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues increased 25% for fiscal 2016, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 10%. Digital commerce sales through NIKE-owned websites, which are not included in comparable store sales, grew 51% in fiscal 2016. Digital commerce sales grew 59% in fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, digital commerce sales represented approximately 22% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues compared to 18% for fiscal 2015. On a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, fiscal 2016 NIKE Brand Mens revenues increased 11%, driven by growth in Sportswear and the Jordan Brand, while Womens revenues increased 17%, led by Sportswear, Running and Womens Training. Revenues for our Young Athletes business increased 11%, with growth across multiple categories, most notably the Jordan Brand. Futures Orders Futures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2017 totaled $ 14.7 billion , 2% lower than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. NIKE Brand futures orders include (1) orders from external wholesale customers and (2) internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations, which are reflected at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. The U.S. Dollar futures orders amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. By geography, futures orders were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Reported Futures Orders  Excluding Currency Changes (1) North America  %  % Western Europe  %  % Central  Eastern Europe  %  % Greater China  %  % Japan  %  % Emerging Markets  %  % TOTAL NIKE BRAND FUTURES ORDERS  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Futures orders have been calculated using prior year exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. ##TABLE_END Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period and have become less correlated due to our evolving business model. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and orders with shorter lead times, and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. A portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales with short lead times, closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, all sales of NIKE Brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations, and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley.

These increases were partially offset by lower retail brand presentation costs. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced Demand creation expense by approximately 1 percentage point. Operating overhead expense was flat compared to fiscal 2016 as continued investments in our growing DTC business were offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced Operating overhead expense by approximately 1 percentage point for fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015  Demand creation expense increased 2% for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to investments in digital brand marketing, including for our DTC business, as well as support for key brand events and initiatives, and sports marketing investments, partially offset by lower advertising expense. For fiscal 2016, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in Demand creation expense by approximately 6 percentage points. Operating overhead expense increased 8% compared to fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of continued investments in our DTC business, including new store openings and higher variable expenses, as well as higher wage-related expenses and investments in consumer-focused digital capabilities, partially offset by lower variable compensation. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in Operating overhead expense by approximately 4 percentage points for fiscal 2016.

Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016  Other (income) expense, net increased from $140 million of other income, net for fiscal 2016 to $196 million of other income, net for fiscal 2017, primarily due to a $56 million net beneficial change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $59 million for fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015  Other (income) expense, net increased from $58 million of other income, net for fiscal 2015 to $140 million of other income, net for fiscal 2016, driven by a $26 million net change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, a favorable settlement of a legal judgment related to a bankruptcy case in Western Europe and net gains from other non-operating items. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $423 million for fiscal 2016.

Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015  The 350 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside the United States, which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. ##TABLE_START Operating Segments ##TABLE_ENDOur operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Companys NIKE Brand DTC operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.

DTC revenues increased 9% for fiscal 2017 due to digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 3%. The broader retail marketplace in North America is being impacted by several significant trends, including shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels, retail consolidation and a promotional environment. Footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2017 was attributable to higher revenues in our Sportswear and Jordan Brand categories, partially offset by declines in other categories. Unit sales of footwear increased 4%, while ASP per pair was flat as higher off-price ASP was offset by unfavorable off-price mix. The increase in apparel revenues for fiscal 2017 was due to growth concentrated in Sportswear, partially offset by declines in several other categories. Unit sales of apparel grew 2% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP. EBIT grew 3% for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin increased 10 basis points as higher full-price ASP and favorable off-price margin more than offset higher product costs and increased off-price mix as a result of clearing excess inventories through off-price channels, including through our DTC business. Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher operating overhead as continued investments in our growing DTC business were partially offset by lower bad debt expense. Demand creation was flat as higher sports marketing and retail brand presentation costs offset lower marketing and advertising costs. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015  On a constant-currency basis, North America revenues increased 8% primarily due to growth in our Sportswear, Jordan Brand and Running categories. DTC revenues grew 17% for fiscal 2016, fueled by strong digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 6%. Currency-neutral footwear revenue growth was attributable to higher revenues in most key categories, led by the Jordan Brand, Sportswear, Running and Women's Training, partially offset by a slight decline in NIKE Basketball. Fiscal 2016 unit sales of footwear increased 8%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business, partially offset by higher off-price mix. Apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by our Sportswear and Men's Training categories. For fiscal 2016, unit sales of apparel grew 7%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth, primarily attributable to higher full-price ASP. EBIT increased 3% for fiscal 2016 as higher revenues were largely offset by lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin declined 80 basis points as higher off-price mix, higher warehousing and inventory obsolescence costs, as well as higher product input costs more than offset higher full-price ASP. Selling and administrative expense increased as a percent of revenues as higher operating overhead to support our growing DTC operations and bad debt expense related to customer bankruptcies was partially offset by lower variable compensation. Demand creation also grew at a faster rate than revenues due to higher spending for sports marketing, DTC marketing and key brand events and initiatives, partially offset by lower advertising expense.

Revenue growth was broad-based across all territories, led by Western Europes largest territory, the UK  Ireland, which grew 11%. On a category basis, revenues increased for nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand. DTC revenues grew 28% for fiscal 2017 due to strong digital commerce sales growth, comparable store sales growth of 16% and the addition of new stores. The constant-currency increase in footwear revenues was led by Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand, partially offset by declines concentrated in Football (Soccer). For fiscal 2017, unit sales of footwear increased 5% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our DTC business. Currency-neutral apparel revenue growth was due to higher revenues for nearly every key category, most notably Sportswear and, to a lesser extent, Football (Soccer). Unit sales of apparel for fiscal 2017 increased 16%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in ASP per unit was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of growth in our DTC business and higher full-price ASP. Reported EBIT decreased 16% for fiscal 2017, in part reflecting the negative impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates. Higher revenues and selling and administrative expense leverage were more than offset by significant gross margin contraction. Gross margin declined 550 basis points primarily driven by the effects of significant unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation expense, as increased sports marketing and advertising expenses more than offset lower marketing costs. Operating overhead also increased due to continued investments in our growing DTC business, partially offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation costs. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015  On a constant-currency basis, Western Europe revenues for fiscal 2016 increased 14% with double-digit growth in every territory. Growth was led by our largest territories, the UK  Ireland and AGS (Austria, Germany and Switzerland), which grew 12% and 16%, respectively. On a category basis, revenues grew for every key category, most notably Sportswear, Football (Soccer) and the Jordan Brand. DTC revenues grew 28% for fiscal 2016, due to strong digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 13%. Currency-neutral footwear revenue growth was fueled by increases in most key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. For fiscal 2016, unit sales of footwear increased 10%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 4 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business, partially offset by higher off-price mix. The constant-currency apparel revenue growth was attributable to increases in every key category, most notably Sportswear, with Football (Soccer) also providing strong growth. Unit sales of apparel for fiscal 2016 increased 11%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily driven by the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business and higher full-price ASP. On a reported basis, EBIT grew 12% for fiscal 2016, despite the negative translation impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the Euro. EBIT grew at a higher rate than revenue as selling and administrative expense leverage and the favorable settlement of a legal judgment related to a bankruptcy case reflected in Other (income) expense, net , were only partially offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin declined 10 basis points as unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher off-price mix were mostly offset by higher full-price ASP, shifts in mix to lower-cost products and growth in our higher-margin DTC business. Selling and administrative expense was lower as a percent of revenues despite higher operating overhead, primarily to support DTC expansion. Demand creation increased slightly as higher spending for DTC and other demand creation costs more than offset lower sports marketing costs.

On a category basis, revenue growth was fueled by higher revenues, primarily in Sportswear, which more than offset declines in several other categories. DTC revenues increased 19%, driven by comparable store sales growth of 9%, the addition of new stores and digital commerce sales growth. The constant-currency footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to higher Sportswear revenues, partially offset by declines in most other categories. Unit sales of footwear increased 7%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher off-price and DTC ASPs. Currency-neutral apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to growth in Sportswear.

The currency-neutral apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2017 was due to higher revenues in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear and Running. Unit sales of apparel increased 15% and higher ASP per unit increased apparel revenue growth by approximately 3 percentage points. The increase in ASP per unit was attributable to higher full-price ASP, partially offset by lower ASP in our DTC business and unfavorable off-price mix. Despite the negative impact of translation, reported EBIT increased 10% for fiscal 2017 driven by higher revenues and selling and administrative expense leverage, partially offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin contracted 240 basis points primarily due to unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead to support DTC growth. Demand creation expense also increased as higher marketing costs more than offset lower retail brand presentation and sports marketing expenses. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015  On a currency-neutral basis, Greater China revenues for fiscal 2016 increased 27%, driven by higher revenues in nearly every key category, led by Sportswear, Running, NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand. DTC revenues increased 44%, driven by significant digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 19%. The constant-currency increase in footwear revenue for fiscal 2016 was driven by growth in nearly every key category, most notably Sportswear, Running, NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand. For fiscal 2016, unit sales of footwear increased 27%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 6 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business. Constant-currency apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2016 was attributable to higher revenues in nearly every key category, led by Running and Sportswear. Unit sales of apparel increased 17% for fiscal 2016 while ASP per unit was flat. On a reported basis, EBIT increased 38% for fiscal 2016 due to strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 80 basis points due to higher full-price ASP and an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-margin DTC business, partially offset by shifts in mix to higher-cost products and unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense decreased as a percent of revenues despite higher operating overhead and demand creation expense. Operating overhead increased largely due to support for our growing DTC operations, while demand creation was also higher, primarily due to retail brand presentation costs to re-profile category and consumer-focused retail stores as well as spending for key brand events.

Most key categories grew, led by Sportswear and Running, partially offset by declines in Golf. DTC revenue growth of 12% was driven by comparable store sales growth of 10%, digital commerce sales growth and the addition of new stores.  On a reported basis, EBIT increased 29%, in part reflecting the impact of the stronger Yen. Reported revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage were only partially offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin declined 150 basis points as lower product costs were more than offset by the impact of unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, unfavorable off-price margin and lower DTC margin. Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense. Operating overhead increased as lower wage-related, administrative and variable compensation costs were more than offset by increased investments in our growing DTC business and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Demand creation expense increased as the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates more than offset lower sports marketing, advertising and marketing costs. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015  On a currency-neutral basis, revenues for Japan increased 22% for fiscal 2016, driven by growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand. DTC revenues were 37% higher, due to strong digital commerce sales growth, comparable store sales growth of 17% and the addition of new stores.  Reported EBIT increased 74%, despite the weaker Yen. EBIT growth was driven by higher reported revenues, gross margin expansion and significant selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin expanded 270 basis points due to higher full-price ASP, in part due to lower discounts, as well as growth in our higher-margin DTC business, lower product input costs and warehousing efficiencies, which more than offset unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense decreased as a percent of revenues despite investments in operating overhead to support our growing DTC business. Demand creation spending for DTC marketing and brand events was largely offset by lower spending for retail brand presentation and advertising costs.

Revenues for three of Emerging Markets largest territories, SOCO (which includes Argentina, Uruguay and Chile), Korea and Mexico, grew 34%, 14% and 18%, respectively. Additionally, revenues increased in most key categories, led by Sportswear and Running. DTC revenues increased 26%, fueled by the addition of new stores, comparable store sales growth of 11% and higher digital commerce sales. The increase in constant-currency footwear revenue for fiscal 2017 was attributable to growth in most key categories, most notably Sportswear and Running. Unit sales of footwear increased 7%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 10 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily attributable to higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories. Currency-neutral growth in apparel revenue was fueled by increases in most key categories, led by Sportswear and Running. For fiscal 2017, unit sales of apparel were flat while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 8 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in ASP per unit was primarily driven by higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories. Reported EBIT decreased 9%, in part reflecting the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Argentine Peso and Mexican Peso. Reported revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage were more than offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin decreased 430 basis points as higher full-price ASP was more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs primarily resulting from ongoing investments in our growing DTC business, partially offset by administrative cost efficiencies. Demand creation expense also increased as lower advertising costs were more than offset by increased marketing support for the Rio Olympics in the first quarter, as well as higher sports marketing costs. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015  On a currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2016 revenues for Emerging Markets increased 13%. Growth was attributable to higher revenues in 7 of 9 territories, led by one of our largest territories, SOCO (which includes Argentina, Uruguay and Chile), which grew 32%, and by Mexico and Pacific (which includes Australia and New Zealand), which grew 31% and 27%, respectively. Revenues declined 5% in Brazil, primarily reflecting on-going macroeconomic challenges. On a category basis, revenues grew in nearly every key category, led by Sportswear and Running. DTC revenues increased 23%, driven by the addition of new stores, comparable store sales growth of 7% and digital commerce sales growth. The constant-currency growth in footwear revenue for fiscal 2016 was driven by higher revenues in nearly every key category, most notably Sportswear and Running. For fiscal 2016, unit sales of footwear increased 1%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 13 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP was attributable to higher full-price ASP, primarily reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business. The constant-currency growth in apparel revenue was due to increases in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running and Women's Training. Fiscal 2016 unit sales of apparel decreased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 13 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP was due to higher full-price ASP, primarily reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business. On a reported basis, EBIT increased 9%, despite the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Argentine Peso, Mexican Peso and Korean Won, as gross margin expansion more than offset lower reported revenues and higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin expanded 350 basis points due to higher full-price ASP, lower warehousing and obsolescence costs, and growth in our higher-margin DTC business, partially offset by shifts in mix to higher-cost products and unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense declined on a reported basis, but was higher as a percent of revenues as higher operating overhead due to additional investments in our DTC business and higher wage-related and variable compensation expenses were more than offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Demand creation expense also increased driven by sports marketing and digital brand marketing costs, offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.

Revenues for Global Brand Divisions are primarily attributable to NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016  Global Brand Divisions loss before interest and taxes increased 3% for fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher demand creation expense, which was only partially offset by a decline in operating overhead expense. The increase in demand creation expense was due to higher marketing and advertising expenses for key brand and sporting events, including the Rio Olympics and the European Football Championship in the first quarter. Operating overhead expense decreased as higher wage-related expenses were more than offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015  Global Brand Divisions loss before interest and taxes increased 15% for fiscal 2016 due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense, and to a lesser extent, lower revenues, largely resulting from the expiration of certain football club endorsement agreements. Operating overhead increased due to higher wage-related expenses and consumer-focused digital capabilities, partially offset by lower variable compensation expenses. Demand creation expense increased due to higher advertising and digital brand marketing expenses.

The largest direct distribution markets are the United States, the United Kingdom and China. We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan. Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalty revenues to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 On a currency-neutral basis, revenues for Converse increased 6% for fiscal 2017. Comparable direct distribution markets (i.e. markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years) grew 4%, contributing approximately 4 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2017. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenue growth. On a territory basis, the increase in comparable direct distribution market revenues was primarily attributable to growth in the United States, partially offset by lower revenues in Europe. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution increased total Converse revenues by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2017, primarily driven by the market transition in Italy. Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 5%, having an insignificant impact to total Converse revenue. The decrease in comparable licensed markets revenues is primarily due to lower revenues in Latin America. Reported EBIT declined 2% for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and lower selling and administrative expense were more than offset by gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased 300 basis points as higher full-price ASP was more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs primarily due to a shift in mix to lower margin products. Gross margin also contracted due to the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues, primarily due to market transitions. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation expense, primarily as a result of lower retail brand presentation costs, partially offset by higher advertising expense. Operating overhead increased as higher wage-related expenses were only partially offset by lower administrative costs. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015  Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, Converse revenues increased 2% for fiscal 2016. Comparable direct distribution markets grew 4%, contributing approximately 3 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2016. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales decreased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of direct distribution market revenue growth. On a territory basis, growth in the United States and Asia Pacific was partially offset by declines in Europe, primarily the United Kingdom. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution markets had an insignificant impact on total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2016. Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 15% for fiscal 2016, reducing total Converse revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point. The decrease in comparable licensed markets revenues was primarily due to poor macroeconomic conditions in Latin America. Reported EBIT for Converse decreased 6% for fiscal 2016 as a decrease in reported revenues and lower gross margin more than offset selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin declined 220 basis points as unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, shifts in mix to higher-cost products and higher off-price mix more than offset higher full-price ASP. Selling and administrative expense declined faster than reported revenues primarily due to lower demand creation, which more than offset slightly higher operating overhead due to higher wage-related expenses.

The Corporate loss before interest and taxes consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses. In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016  For fiscal 2017, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes decreased $449 million primarily due to the following: ##TABLE_START  a beneficial change of $280 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses; these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a beneficial change of $115 million, primarily driven by lower variable compensation and administrative costs in operating overhead expense; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  an increase in net foreign currency gains of $54 million related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other (income) expense, net. ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015  For fiscal 2016, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased $76 million primarily due to the following: ##TABLE_START  an increase of $179 million, primarily driven by higher operating overhead expense to support corporate growth initiatives; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a beneficial change of $76 million from net foreign currency losses to net foreign currency gains related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains; these gains are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a beneficial change of $27 million in net foreign currency gains related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other (income) expense, net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices ##TABLE_ENDOverview As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (NTC) and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Transactional Exposures We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: ##TABLE_START  Product Costs  NIKEs product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. ##TABLE_END In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost. ##TABLE_START 2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. ##TABLE_END For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net . Refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthe ning U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKEs U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost. ##TABLE_START  Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales  A portion of our Western Europe and Central  Eastern Europe geography revenues, as well as a portion of our Converse European operations revenues, are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Costs  Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has also entered into other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to foreign currencies and create embedded derivative contracts that are recorded at fair value through  Other (income) expense, net . Refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities  Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations. ##TABLE_END Managing Transactional Exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements as discussed above. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements and Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded, as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end. Translational Exposures Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $542 million and $1,985 million for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $115 million and $449 million for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Managing Translational Exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements and Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end. We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $59 million and $423 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2017 and 2016. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016. ##TABLE_START Liquidity and Capital Resources ##TABLE_ENDCash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $3,640 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $3,096 million for fiscal 2016 . Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $4,781 million of operating cash flow in fiscal 2017 compared to $4,676 million for fiscal 2016 . Our fiscal 2017 change in working capital was a cash outflow of $1,141 million compared to an outflow of $1,580 million for fiscal 2016 . The change in working capital was primarily due to the net change in cash collateral with derivative counterparties as a result of hedging activities. For fiscal 2017, cash collateral received from counterparties, which is recorded in Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, decreased $105 million compared to a decrease of $863 million during fiscal 2016. Refer to the Credit Risk section of Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. This decrease in cash collateral was partially offset by a $486 million increase in Accounts Receivable, net driven by higher revenues. Cash used by investing activities was $1,008 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $1,034 million for fiscal 2016 , driven primarily by the net change in short-term investments and reverse repurchase agreements, as well as additions of property, plant and equipment. During fiscal 2017 , the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash inflow of $118 million compared to an outflow of $57 million in fiscal 2016 . This change was partially offset by the maturity of reverse repurchase agreements of $150 million in fiscal 2016 which did not recur in fiscal 2017 . Additions of property, plant and equipment were $1,105 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $1,143 million in fiscal 2016 . In fiscal 2018, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, including corporate facilities, new DTC stores, and expanding our digital capabilities. We continue to expect such investments will be approximately 4% of revenues, on average. Cash used by financing activities was $1,942 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $2,671 million for fiscal 2016 . The decrease in Cash used by financing activities was primarily driven by increased proceeds from the issuance of debt and commercial paper in fiscal 2017, partially offset by higher dividends and lower excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. In fiscal 2017 , we purchased 59.7 million shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock for $3,249 million (an average price of $ 54.43 per share) under the four-year, $12 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in November 2015. As of May 31, 2017, we had repurchased 79.8 million shares at a cost of approximately $4,437 million (an average price of $55.63 per share) under this program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceeds from debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Capital Resources On October 21, 2016, we issued $1.5 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2026 and 2046. The 2026 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion at a 2.375% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on November 1, 2026. The 2046 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.375% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on November 1, 2046. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted in proceeds before expenses of $1,493 million. Refer to Note 8  Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on Long-term debt . On August 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. As of and for the periods ended May 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility. We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2017 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our $2 billion commercial paper program. During the year ended May 31, 2017 , the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was $919 million. As of May 31, 2017 , there were $325 million of outstanding borrowings under this program. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2018 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. As of May 31, 2017 , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $6.2 billion , of which $5.8 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash equivalents and Short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2017 , the average duration of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 65 days. To date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the United States through debt, we would incur additional interest expense. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2017 and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows: ##TABLE_START Description of Commitment  Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, (In millions)       Thereafter  Total Operating Leases  $  $  $  $  $  $ 1,672  $ 3,905 Capital Leases and Other Financing Obligations (1)        Long-Term Debt (2)       5,322  5,888 Endorsement Contracts (3)  1,323  1,214  1,054   1,032  4,338  9,850 Product Purchase Obligations (4)  4,521            4,521 Other Purchase Obligations (5)  1,000       1,915 TOTAL  $ 7,530  $ 2,243  $ 1,817  $ 1,531  $ 1,592  $ 11,736  $ 26,449 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Capital leases and other financing obligations include payments related to build-to-suit lease arrangements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) The cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2017 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. ##TABLE_END In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. ##TABLE_START (4) We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) Other purchase obligations primarily include construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. ##TABLE_ENDIn addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes and Note 13  Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2017 . Refer to Note 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. ##TABLE_START  Outstanding as of May 31, 2017 (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand $ Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2017 , the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling $152 million . These letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Companys performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. ##TABLE_START New Accounting Pronouncements ##TABLE_ENDRefer to Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards. ##TABLE_START Critical Accounting Policies ##TABLE_ENDOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and digital commerce revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the United States, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. We base our estimates on (1) historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims are significantly greater or lower than established reserves, we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales . If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to Cost of sales . Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are recorded in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance, increased or decreased Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract term. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Other comprehensive income , rather than Net income , until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income . In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Other comprehensive income into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Other comprehensive income to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Income Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, thus reducing our overall Income tax expense . The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional Income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our Income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense . The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense . Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2017 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities. ##TABLE_START Market Risk Measurement ##TABLE_ENDWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (VaR). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $97 million and $109 million at May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The VAR decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2017. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $161 million and $209 million during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows. Details of third-party debt are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. ##TABLE_START   Expected Maturity Date Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions)       Thereafter  Total  Fair Value Foreign Exchange Risk                 Japanese Yen Functional Currency                 Long-term Japanese Yen debt  Fixed rate                 Principal payments  $  $  $  $  $   $   $  $ Average interest rate  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  2.4 %   Interest Rate Risk                 Japanese Yen Functional Currency                 Long-term Japanese Yen debt  Fixed rate                 Principal payments  $  $  $  $  $   $   $  $ Average interest rate  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  2.4 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  2.4 %   U.S. Dollar Functional Currency                 Long-term U.S. Dollar debt  Fixed rate                 Principal payments  $   $   $   $   $   $ 3,500  $ 3,500  $ 3,379 Average interest rate  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  0.0 %  3.1 %  3.1 %   ##TABLE_ENDThe fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries.

The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and include certain amounts based on our best estimates and judgments. Other financial information in this report is consistent with these financial statements. Our accounting systems include controls designed to reasonably assure assets are safeguarded from unauthorized use or disposition and provide for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These systems are supplemented by the selection and training of qualified financial personnel and an organizational structure providing for appropriate segregation of duties. An internal Corporate Audit department reviews the results of its work with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, presently comprised of four outside, independent directors. The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews, with the independent registered public accounting firm, management and the internal audit staff, the scope and the results of the annual audit, the effectiveness of the accounting control system and other matters relating to the financial affairs of NIKE as the Audit Committee deems appropriate. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have full access to the Audit Committee, with and without the presence of management, to discuss any appropriate matters. ##TABLE_START Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting ##TABLE_ENDManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(f) and Rule 15(d) - 15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect on the financial statements. While reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, it does not mean absolute assurance. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatement and instance of fraud. Controls are susceptible to manipulation, especially in instances of fraud caused by the collusion of two or more people, including our senior management. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2017 . PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited (1) the Consolidated Financial Statements and (2) the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2017 , as stated in their report herein. ##TABLE_START Mark G.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /S/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP Portland, Oregon July 20, 2017   ##TABLE_START NIKE, Inc.

NIKE, Inc. portfolio brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse. The NIKE Brand is focused on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services across a wide range of sport categories, amplified with sport-inspired sportswear products carrying the Swoosh trademark as well as other NIKE Brand trademarks. The Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. The Hurley brand is focused on surf and action sports and youth lifestyle footwear, apparel and accessories, using the Hurley trademark. Sales and operating results of Hurley brand products are reported within the NIKE Brands North America geographic operating segment. Converse designs, distributes, markets and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis. Basis of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. On November 19, 2015, the Company announced a two -for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2015. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 24, 2015. All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2017 presentation. Revenue Recognition Wholesale revenues are recognized when title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. This occurs upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and online store revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims from customers are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale. Post-invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. Estimates of discretionary discounts, returns and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and (3) estimated discounts, returns and claims expected, but not yet finalized with customers. As of May 31, 2017 and 2016 , the Companys reserve balances for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims were $643 million and $789 million , respectively. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and research, design and development costs. Outbound shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales . Demand Creation Expense Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, television, digital and print advertising, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run. Advertising communication costs are expensed when the advertisement appears. Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is completed and delivered. A significant amount of the Companys promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. Accounting for endorsement payments is based upon specific contract provisions. Generally, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract after giving recognition to periodic performance compliance provisions of the contracts. Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). The Company records demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When the Company determines payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the Companys best estimate of the endorsers performance. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from the Companys estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance, increased or decreased demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. The Company expenses these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, the Company offers minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which the Company estimates it will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, the Company records the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract period. Through cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses customers for certain costs of advertising the Companys products. The Company records these costs in Demand creation expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs. This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run. Total advertising and promotion expenses were $3,341 million , $3,278 million and $3,213 million for the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses totaled $558 million and $540 million at May 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, of which $311 million and $272 million , respectively, was recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets , and $247 million  and  $268 million , respectively, was recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets, depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Operating Overhead Expense Operating overhead expense consists primarily of wage and benefit-related expenses as well as other administrative costs, such as rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services and meetings and travel. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, money market funds, time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. Short-Term Investments Short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, time deposits and corporate debt securities, with maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase. Debt securities that the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At May 31, 2017 and 2016 , the Company did not hold any short-term investments that were classified as trading or held-to-maturity. At May 31, 2017 and 2016 , Short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive income , unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at the date of purchase as current assets within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Companys short-term investments. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, net consist primarily of amounts receivable from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets . The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $19 million and $43 million at May 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and valued on either an average or specific identification cost basis. For inventories in transit that represent direct shipments to customers, the related inventory and cost of sales are recognized on a specific identification basis. Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Company's suppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance and logistics and other handling fees. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for land improvements, buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years. Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales . Depreciation and amortization of all other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense . Software Development Costs Internal Use Software : Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 12 year period on a straight-line basis. The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed : Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test first requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the Company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, the Company measures and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the C ompany determines that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, the Company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Operating Leases The Company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space and other non-real estate assets under operating leases. Operating lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. Rent expense for non-cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, beginning with the effective lease commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Certain leases also provide for contingent rent, which is generally determined as a percent of sales in excess of specified levels. A contingent rent liability is recognized together with the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable. Fair Value Measurements The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives and available-for-sale securities. Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach). The levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: ##TABLE_START  Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. ##TABLE_END The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Pricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and that of its counterparties. Level 1 investments include U.S. Treasury securities. Assets and liabilities included within Level 2 include commercial paper, U.S. Agency securities, money market funds, time deposits, corporate debt securities and derivative contracts. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs and are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. The Companys fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for additional information. Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactions Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in Total shareholders equity . The Companys global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, the impact of which is recorded in Other (income) expense, net , within the Consolidated Statements of Income. Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (a component of Total shareholders equity ), Long-term debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For designated net investment hedges, this is within the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the Companys fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives. Stock-Based Compensation The Company estimates the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted under the NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan and employees purchase rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes this fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as Operating overhead expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the vesting period using the straight-line method. Refer to Note 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for more information on the Companys stock-based compensation programs. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. United States income taxes are provided currently on financial statement earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are expected to be repatriated. The Company determines annually the amount of undistributed non-U.S. earnings to invest indefinitely in its non-U.S. operations. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense . Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes for further discussion. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards. Refer to Note 12  Earnings Per Share for further discussion. Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03, Interest  Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The updated guidance requires debt issuance costs to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding debt liability on the balance sheet. The Company adopted the standard on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The adoption of this standard reduced both Deferred income taxes and other assets and Long-term debt by  $17 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2016 . Recently Issued Accounting Standards In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory . The updated guidance requires companies to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of inventory will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The ASU is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach, with the cumulative effect recognized through retained earnings at the date of adoption. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which interim or annual financial statements have not been issued. The Company is evaluating the impact this update will have on its existing accounting policies and the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company anticipates the updated guidance could have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements at adoption through the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of previously deferred charges. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees. The updated guidance requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies from share-based payment awards to be recorded in income tax expense in the income statement. Currently, excess tax benefits and deficiencies are recognized in shareholders equity on the balance sheet. This change is required to be applied prospectively. In addition, the updated guidance also changes the accounting for statutory tax withholding requirements, classification in the statement of cash flows and provides an option to continue to estimate forfeitures or account for forfeitures as they occur. The Company will adopt the standard on June 1, 2017 and will elect to continue to estimate forfeitures. The ASU is expected to result in increased volatility to the Companys income tax expense in future periods dependent upon, among other variables, the price of its common stock and the timing and volume of share-based payment award activity, such as employee exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock awards. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , that replaces existing lease accounting guidance. The new standard is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance will require the Company to continue to classify leases as either operating or financing, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The Company will adopt the standard on June 1, 2019. The ASU is required to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest period presented, with optional practical expedients. The Company is in the process of evaluating the effect the guidance will have on its existing accounting policies and the Consolidated Financial Statements, but expects there will be an increase in assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at adoption due to the recording of right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities, which may be material. Refer to Note 15  Commitments and Contingencies for information about the Companys lease obligations. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments  Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . The updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The update to the standard is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ,  that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. The updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company will adopt the standard on June 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effective of initially applying the new standard recognized in retained earnings at the date of initial application. The Company is in the process of evaluating the new standard against its existing accounting policies, including the timing of revenue recognition, and its contracts with customers, to determine the effect the guidance will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_START NOTE 2  Inventories ##TABLE_ENDInventory balances of $5,055 million and $4,838 million at May 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, were substantially all finished goods. ##TABLE_START NOTE 3  Property, Plant and Equipment ##TABLE_ENDProperty, plant and equipment, net included the following: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   Land and improvements  $  $ Buildings  1,564  1,467 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software  3,867  3,510 Leasehold improvements  1,484  1,338 Construction in process   Total property, plant and equipment, gross  7,958  7,038 Less accumulated depreciation  3,969  3,518 TOTAL PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET  $ 3,989  $ 3,520 ##TABLE_ENDCapitalized interest was not material for the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . ##TABLE_START NOTE 4  Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill ##TABLE_ENDIdentifiable intangible assets, net consist of indefinite-lived trademarks, which are not subject to amortization, and acquired trademarks and other intangible assets, which are subject to amortization.

The Companys derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements that allow for the offset of assets and liabilities in the event of default or early termination of the contract. Any amounts of cash collateral received related to these instruments associated with the Company's credit-related contingent features are recorded in Cash and equivalents and Accrued liabilities , the latter of which would further offset against the Companys derivative asset balance (refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives ). Any amounts of cash collateral posted related to these instruments associated with the Company's credit-related contingent features are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets , which would further offset against the Company's derivative liability balance (refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives ). Cash collateral received or posted related to the Company's credit related contingent features is presented in the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Any amounts of non-cash collateral received, such as securities, are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets pursuant to U.S. GAAP. The following tables present information about the Companys derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of May 31, 2017 and 2016 , and indicate the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the Company classifies the fair value measurement. ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, 2017   Derivative Assets  Derivative Liabilities (In millions)  Assets at Fair Value  Other Current Assets  Other Long-term Assets  Liabilities at Fair Value  Accrued Liabilities  Other Long-term Liabilities Level 2:             Foreign exchange forwards and options (1)  $  $  $  $  $  $ Embedded derivatives       Interest rate swaps             TOTAL  $  $  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) If the foreign exchange derivative instruments had been netted in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the asset and liability positions each would have been reduced by $187 million as of May 31, 2017 .

These securities are valued using market prices on both active markets (Level 1) and less active markets (Level 2). As of May 31, 2017 , the Company held $2,125 million of available-for-sale securities with maturity dates within one year and $246 million with maturity dates over one year and less than five years within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The gross realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities were immaterial for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016 . Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities included in Accumulated other comprehensive income were immaterial as of May 31, 2017 and 2016 . The Company regularly reviews its available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment. For the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016 , the Company did not consider its securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired and accordingly, did not recognize any impairment losses. Included in Interest expense (income), net was interest income related to the Company's available-for-sale securities of $27 million , $12 million and $6 million for the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The Companys Level 3 assets comprise investments in certain non-marketable preferred stock. These Level 3 investments are an immaterial portion of the Company's portfolio. Changes in Level 3 investment assets were immaterial during the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016 .

The Company purchases through Sojitz America certain NIKE Brand products it acquires from non-U.S. suppliers. These purchases are for products sold in certain countries in the Company's Emerging Markets geographic operating segment and Canada, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Accounts payable to Sojitz America are generally due up to 60 days after shipment of goods from the foreign port. The interest rate on such accounts payable is the 60 -day London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as of the beginning of the month of the invoice date, plus 0.75% . As of May 31, 2017 , the Company had $325 million outstanding under its $2 billion commercial paper program at a weighted average interest rate of 0.86% . No borrowings were outstanding at May 31, 2016 . On August 28, 2015, the Company entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. Based on the Companys current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.455% . The facility fee is 0.045% of the total commitment. Under this committed credit facility, the Company must maintain certain financial ratios, among other things, with which the Company was in compliance at May 31, 2017 . No amounts were outstanding under the committed credit facility as of May 31, 2017 or 2016 . ##TABLE_START NOTE 8  Long-Term Debt ##TABLE_ENDLong-term debt , net of unamortized premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs, comprises the following : ##TABLE_START         Book Value Outstanding as of May 31, Scheduled Maturity (Dollars and Yen in millions)  Original Principal  Interest Rate  Interest Payments   Corporate Bond Payables: (1)(2)           May 1, 2023  $  2.25 %  Semi-Annually   November 1, 2026  $ 1,000  2.38 %  Semi-Annually    May 1, 2043  $  3.63 %  Semi-Annually   November 1, 2045  $ 1,000  3.88 %  Semi-Annually   November 1, 2046  $  3.38 %  Semi-Annually    Promissory Notes:           April 1, 2017  $  6.20 %  Monthly    Japanese Yen Notes: (3)           August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020   9,000  2.60 %  Quarterly   August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020   4,000  2.00 %  Quarterly   Total        3,477  2,037 Less current maturities         TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT        $ 3,471  $ 1,993 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) These senior unsecured obligations rank equally with the Companys other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) The bonds are redeemable at the Companys option up to three months prior to the scheduled maturity date for the bonds maturing in 2023 and 2026, and up to six months prior to the scheduled maturity date for the bonds maturing in 2043, 2045 and 2046, at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. Within three and six months to scheduled maturity, respectively, the bonds also feature a par call provision, which allows for the bonds to be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) NIKE Logistics YK assumed a total of 13.0 billion in loans as part of its agreement to purchase a distribution center in Japan, which serves as collateral for the loans. These loans mature in equal quarterly installments during the period August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020. ##TABLE_END The scheduled maturity of Long-term debt in each of the years ending May 31, 2018 through 2022 are $6 million , $6 million , $6 million , $3 million and $0 million , respectively, at face value. The Company's Long-term debt is recorded at adjusted cost, net of unamortized premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs. The fair value of Long-term debt is estimated based upon quoted prices for similar instruments or quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets (Level 2). The fair value of the Companys Long-term debt , including the current portion, was approximately $3,401 million at May 31, 2017 and $2,125 million at May 31, 2016 . ##TABLE_START NOTE 9  Income Taxes ##TABLE_ENDIncome before income taxes is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Income before income taxes:       United States  $ 1,240  $  $ 1,967 Foreign  3,646  3,667  2,238 TOTAL INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  $ 4,886  $ 4,623  $ 4,205 ##TABLE_ENDThe provision for income taxes is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Current:       United States       Federal  $  $  $ State    Foreign    Total    1,045 Deferred:       United States       Federal  (279 )  (57 )  (66 ) State  (9 )  (16 )  (11 ) Foreign   (7 )  (36 ) Total  (273 )  (80 )  (113 ) TOTAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDA reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,     Federal income tax rate  35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % State taxes, net of federal benefit  1.1 %  1.1 %  0.9 % Foreign earnings  -20.7 %  -18.2 %  -14.8 % Resolution of a U.S. tax matter  -3.2 %   %   % Other, net  1.0 %  0.8 %  1.1 % EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE  13.2 %  18.7 %  22.2 % ##TABLE_ENDThe effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2017 was 550 basis points lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2016 primarily due to a one-time benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the United States. The effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2016 was 350 basis points lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside of the United States, which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities comprise the following:  ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   Deferred tax assets:     Allowance for doubtful accounts  $  $ Inventories   Sales return reserves   Deferred compensation   Stock-based compensation   Reserves and accrued liabilities   Net operating loss carry-forwards   Foreign tax credit carry-forwards    Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries   Other   Total deferred tax assets  1,452  1,128 Valuation allowance  (82 )  (52 ) Total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance  1,370  1,076 Deferred tax liabilities:     Property, plant and equipment  (254 )  (268 ) Intangibles  (90 )  (92 ) Other  (2 )  (4 ) Total deferred tax liability  (346 )  (364 ) NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET  $ 1,024  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe following is a reconciliation of the changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)    Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of the period  $  $  $ Gross increases related to prior period tax positions    Gross decreases related to prior period tax positions  (163 )  (20 )  (123 ) Gross increases related to current period tax positions    Gross decreases related to current period tax positions      (9 ) Settlements  (12 )  (13 )  (27 ) Lapse of statute of limitations  (21 )  (17 )  (10 ) Changes due to currency translation   (12 )  (13 ) UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, END OF THE PERIOD  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2017 , total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were $461 million , $230 million of which would affect the Company's effective tax rate if recognized in future periods. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense . The liability for payment of interest and penalties decreased by $38 million during the year ended May 31, 2017 , increased by $45 million during the year ended May 31, 2016 and decreased by $3 million during the year ended May 31, 2015 . As of May 31, 2017 and 2016 , accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $171 million and $209 million , respectively (excluding federal benefit). The Company is subject to taxation in the United States as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. As previously disclosed, the Company received statutory notices of deficiency from the IRS for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 proposing a total increase in tax of $254 million , subject to interest, related to a foreign tax credit matter. The Company contested these deficiencies by filing petitions with the U.S Tax Court. During the three months ended August 31, 2016, the Company reached a resolution with the IRS on this matter. Decisions were subsequently filed in U.S. District Tax Court stating there is no deficiency in income tax due from the Company. In the current period, the Company closed all U.S. federal income tax matters for fiscal years 2013 and 2014, with the exception of certain transfer pricing adjustments. The Company is currently under audit by the IRS for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 . The Companys major foreign jurisdictions, China and the Netherlands, have concluded substantially all income tax matters through calendar 2006 and fiscal 2010, respectively. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in the aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $69 million within the next 12 months. The Company provides for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At May 31, 2017 , the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes have not been provided were approximately $12.2 billion . If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences of undistributed earnings would be approximately $4.1 billion at May 31, 2017 . A portion of the Company's foreign operations are benefiting from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2021 . This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The tax benefit attributable to this tax holiday was $187 million , $173 million and $174 million for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on diluted earnings per common share was $0.11 , $0.10 and $0.10 for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Deferred tax assets at May 31, 2017 and 2016 were reduced by a valuation allowance primarily relating to tax benefits of certain entities with operating losses. There was a $30 million net increase in the valuation allowance for the year ended May 31, 2017 , compared to a net increase of $43 million for the year ended May 31, 2016 and no net change for the year ended May 31, 2015 . The Company has recorded deferred tax assets of $208 million at May 31, 2017 for foreign tax credit carry-forwards which expire in 2027. The Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of $266 million at May 31, 2017 . Such losses will expire as follows:  ##TABLE_START   Year Ending May 31, (In millions)      2022-2035  Indefinite  Total Net operating losses  $  $  $  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDDuring the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , income tax benefits attributable to employee stock-based compensation transactions of $177 million , $281 million and $224 million , respectively, were allocated to Total shareholders equity . ##TABLE_START NOTE 10  Redeemable Preferred Stock ##TABLE_ENDSojitz America is the sole owner of the Companys authorized redeemable preferred stock, $1 par value, which is redeemable at the option of Sojitz America or the Company at par value aggregating $0.3 million . A cumulative dividend of $0.10 per share is payable annually on May 31 and no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock of the Company unless dividends on the redeemable preferred stock have been declared and paid in full. There have been no changes in the redeemable preferred stock in the three years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . As the holder of the redeemable preferred stock, Sojitz America does not have general voting rights, but does have the right to vote as a separate class on the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, on merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company or on the sale or assignment of the NIKE trademark for athletic footwear sold in the United States. The redeemable preferred stock has been fully issued to Sojitz America and is not blank check preferred stock. The Company's articles of incorporation do not permit the issuance of additional preferred stock. ##TABLE_START NOTE 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation ##TABLE_ENDThe authorized number of shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value, and Class B Common Stock, no par value, are 400 million and 2,400 million , respectively. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors. There are no differences in the dividend and liquidation preferences or participation rights of the holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock. The NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the Stock Incentive Plan) provides for the issuance of up to 718 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with stock options and other awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. The Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance-based awards. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the Stock Incentive Plan. The committee has the authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards and the other terms and conditions of the awards. Substantially all stock option grants outstanding under the Stock Incentive Plan are granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year, vest ratably over four years and expire ten years from the date of grant. The following table summarizes the Companys total stock-based compensation expense recognized in Operating overhead expense :  ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Stock options (1)  $  $  $ ESPPs    Restricted stock    TOTAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Expense for stock options includes the expense associated with stock appreciation rights. Accelerated stock option expense is recorded for employees eligible for accelerated stock option vesting upon retirement. Accelerated stock option expense was $14 million , $30 million and $19 million for the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. ##TABLE_END As of May 31, 2017 , the Company had $201 million of unrecognized compensation costs from stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, to be recognized in Operating overhead expense over a weighted average remaining period of 1.9 years. The weighted average fair value per share of the options granted during the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , computed as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model, was $9.38 , $12.66 and $8.48 , respectively. The weighted average assumptions used to estimate these fair values are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,     Dividend yield  1.1 %  1.0 %  1.2 % Expected volatility  17.4 %  23.6 %  23.6 % Weighted average expected life (in years)  6.0  5.8  5.8 Risk-free interest rate  1.3 %  1.7 %  1.7 % ##TABLE_ENDThe Company estimates the expected volatility based on the implied volatility in market traded options on the Companys common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. The weighted average expected life of options is based on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns. The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rate in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the options. The following summarizes the stock option transactions under the plan discussed above:  ##TABLE_START   Shares (1)  Weighted Average Option Price   (In millions)   Options outstanding May 31, 2014  127.1  $ 19.64 Exercised  (27.2 )  15.39 Forfeited  (2.1 )  29.51 Granted  18.4  38.84 Options outstanding May 31, 2015  116.2  23.50 Exercised  (22.5 )  17.75 Forfeited  (2.3 )  39.96 Granted  20.6  56.41 Options outstanding May 31, 2016  112.0  30.38 Exercised  (17.1 )  20.42 Forfeited  (2.3 )  49.47 Granted  12.2  57.81 Options outstanding May 31, 2017  104.8  $ 34.79 Options exercisable at May 31,      68.6  $ 18.26  66.5  21.48  67.9  26.03 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Includes stock appreciation rights transactions. ##TABLE_END The weighted average contractual life remaining for options outstanding and options exercisable at May 31, 2017 was 5.7 years and 4.5 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable at May 31, 2017 was $2,027 million and $1,846 million , respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value was the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of the options. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $594 million , $946 million and $795 million , respectively. In addition to the Stock Incentive Plan, the Company gives employees the right to purchase shares at a discount to the market price under employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs). Subject to the annual statutory limit, employees are eligible to participate through payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation. At the end of each six -month offering period, shares are purchased by the participants at 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or the end of the offering period. Employees purchased 3.1 million , 2.5 million and 2.7 million shares during each of the three years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. From time to time, the Company grants restricted stock and restricted stock units to key employees under the Stock Incentive Plan. The number of shares underlying such awards granted to employees during the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were 0.4 million , 1.0 million and 0.5 million , respectively, with weighted average values per share of $57.59 , $54.87 and $39.69 , respectively. Recipients of restricted stock are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respective shares throughout the period of restriction. Recipients of restricted stock units are entitled to dividend equivalent cash payments upon vesting. The value of all grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units was established by the market price on the date of grant. During the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the aggregate fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested was $60 million , $49 million and $20 million , respectively, determined as of the date of vesting. As of May 31, 2017 , the Company had $43 million of unrecognized compensation costs from restricted stock and restricted stock units to be recognized in Operating overhead expense over a weighted average period of 2.4 years. ##TABLE_START NOTE 12  Earnings Per Share ##TABLE_ENDThe following is a reconciliation from basic earnings per common share to diluted earnings per common share. The computations of diluted earnings per common share excluded options, including shares under employee stock purchase plans, to purchase an additional 30.5 million , 0.2 million and 1.7 million shares of common stock outstanding for the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, because the options were anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions, except per share data)    Determination of shares:       Weighted average common shares outstanding  1,657.8  1,697.9  1,723.5 Assumed conversion of dilutive stock options and awards  34.2  44.6  45.3 DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING  1,692.0  1,742.5  1,768.8        Earnings per common share:       Basic  $ 2.56  $ 2.21  $ 1.90 Diluted  $ 2.51  $ 2.16  $ 1.85 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START NOTE 13  Benefit Plans ##TABLE_ENDThe Company has a qualified 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan, in which all U.S. employees are able to participate. The Company matches a portion of employee contributions to the savings plan. Company contributions to the savings plan were $75 million , $72 million and $58 million and included in Operating overhead expense for the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The terms of the plan also allow for annual discretionary profit sharing contributions, as determined by the Board of Directors, to the accounts of eligible U.S. employees who work at least 1,000 hours in a year. Profit sharing contributions of $68 million , $64 million and $58 million were made to the plan and included in Operating overhead expense for the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The Company also has a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) that was adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by shareholders in September 1997 and later amended and approved in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2012. The Company recognized $21 million , $85 million and $68 million of Operating overhead expense related to cash awards under the LTIP during the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The Company allows certain highly compensated employees and non-employee directors of the Company to defer compensation under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Deferred compensation plan liabilities were $569 million and $475 million at May 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and primarily classified as long-term in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities . The Company has pension plans in various countries worldwide. The pension plans are only available to local employees and are generally government mandated. The liability related to the unfunded pension liabilities of the plans was $107 million and $93 million at May 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and primarily classified as long-term in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities . ##TABLE_START NOTE 14  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ##TABLE_ENDThe changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income , net of tax, were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In millions)  Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment (1)  Cash Flow Hedges  Net Investment Hedges (1)  Other  Total Balance at May 31, 2016  $ (207 )  $  $  $ (53 )  $ Other comprehensive gains (losses) before reclassifications (2)      (14 )  Reclassifications to net income of previously deferred (gains) losses (3)   (633 )    (18 )  (650 ) Other comprehensive income (loss)   (515 )    (32 )  (531 ) Balance at May 31, 2017  $ (191 )  $ (52 )  $  $ (85 )  $ (213 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment and net investment hedge gains/losses related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary are reclassified to Net income upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the respective entity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Net of tax benefit (expense) of $ 0 million , $ 24 million , $ 0 million , $ 3 million and $ 27 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Net of tax (benefit) expense of $ 0 million , $ (3) million , $ 0 million , $ (3) million and $ (6) million , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (In millions)  Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment (1)  Cash Flow Hedges  Net Investment Hedges (1)  Other  Total Balance at May 31, 2015  $ (31 )  $ 1,220  $  $ (58 )  $ 1,246 Other comprehensive gains (losses) before reclassifications (2)  (178 )  (47 )     (219 ) Reclassifications to net income of previously deferred (gains) losses (3)   (710 )    (1 )  (709 ) Other comprehensive income (loss)  (176 )  (757 )     (928 ) Balance at May 31, 2016  $ (207 )  $  $  $ (53 )  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment and net investment hedge gains/losses related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary are reclassified to Net income upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the respective entity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Net of tax benefit (expense) of $ 0 million , $ 28 million , $ 0 million , $ (2) million and $ 26 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Net of tax (benefit) expense of $ 0 million , $ 7 million , $ 0 million , $ 2 million and $ 9 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the reclassifications from Accumulated other comprehensive income to the Consolidated Statements of Income: ##TABLE_START   Amount of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income     Year Ended May 31, (In millions)   Gains (losses) on foreign currency translation adjustment  (1 )  (2 ) Other (income) expense, net Total before tax  (1 )  (2 )  Tax (expense) benefit      Gain (loss) net of tax  (1 )  (2 )  Gains (losses) on cash flow hedges:      Foreign exchange forwards and options   (88 ) Revenues Foreign exchange forwards and options   Cost of sales Foreign exchange forwards and options     Total selling and administrative expense Foreign exchange forwards and options   Other (income) expense, net Interest rate swaps  (4 )   Interest expense (income), net Total before tax    Tax (expense) benefit   (7 )  Gain (loss) net of tax    Gains (losses) on other   Other (income) expense, net Total before tax    Tax (expense) benefit   (2 )  Gain (loss) net of tax    Total net gain (loss) reclassified for the period  $  $  ##TABLE_ENDRefer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Company's risk management program and derivatives. ##TABLE_START NOTE 15  Commitments and Contingencies ##TABLE_ENDThe Company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, and office space and other non-real estate assets under operating leases expiring from 1 to 17 years after May 31, 2017 .

These letters of credit were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and guarantees of the Companys performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. In connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the Companys historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of its pending legal matters with certainty, the Company does not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ##TABLE_START NOTE 16  Risk Management and Derivatives ##TABLE_ENDThe Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2017 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs . All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date.

Cash Flow Hedges The purpose of the Company's foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency exposures that the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external and intercompany revenues, selling and administrative expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions. Product cost exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below. NIKE entities primarily purchase products in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities  purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a wholly owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the product to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. The Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the Company's existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, the Companys payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order. Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below. The Companys policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $11.1 billion as of May 31, 2017 . During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company terminated all forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $1.5 billion in connection with the October 21, 2016 debt issuance (refer to Note 8 - Long-Term Debt). Upon termination of these forward-starting swaps, the Company made cash payments to the related counterparties of $92 million , which was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income and will be released through Interest expense (income), net as interest expense is incurred over the term of the issued debt. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company terminated certain forward-starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $1 billion in connection with the October 29, 2015 debt issuance (refer to Note 8  Long-Term Debt ). Upon termination of these forward-starting swaps, the Company received cash payments from the related counterparties of $34 million , which was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income and will be released through Interest expense (income), net as interest expense is incurred over the term of the issued debt. All changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, excluding any ineffective portion, are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income until Net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. In most cases, amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income will be released to Net income in periods following the maturity of the related derivative, rather than at maturity. Effective hedge results are classified within the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure. The results of hedges of non-functional currency denominated revenues and product cost exposures, excluding embedded derivatives, are recorded in Revenues or Cost of sales when the underlying hedged transaction affects consolidated Net income . Results of hedges of selling and administrative expense are recorded together with those costs when the related expense is recorded. Amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income related to forward-starting interest rate swaps will be released through Interest expense (income), net as interest expense is incurred over the term of the issued debt. Results of hedges of anticipated purchases and sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities are recorded in  Other (income) expense, net  when the securities are sold. Results of hedges of certain anticipated intercompany transactions are recorded in Other (income) expense, net  when the transaction occurs. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from these designated cash flow hedge derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Premiums paid or received on options are initially recorded as deferred charges or deferred credits, respectively. The Company assesses the effectiveness of options based on the total cash flows method and records total changes in the options fair value to Accumulated other comprehensive income to the degree they are effective. The Company formally assesses, both at a hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Effectiveness for cash flow hedges is assessed based on changes in forward rates . Ineffectiveness was immaterial for the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when: (1) it determines that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item (including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions); (2) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; (3) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, but is expected to occur within an additional two -month period of time thereafter, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in Accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified to Net income when the forecasted transaction affects consolidated Net income . However, if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were in Accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in Other (income) expense, net . In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry the derivative at its fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, recognizing future changes in the fair value in Other (income) expense, net . For the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the amounts recorded in Other (income) expense, net as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedging because the forecasted transaction was no longer probable of occurring were immaterial . As of May 31, 2017 , $100 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income . Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2017 , the maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 24 months. Fair Value Hedges The Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method requirements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. The cash flows associated with the Companys fair value hedges are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding, which are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 or 2015 . On October 15, 2015, the Company repaid the long-term debt which had previously been hedged with these interest rate swaps. Accordingly, a s of May 31, 2017 , the Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges. Net Investment Hedges The Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign-currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges, except ineffective portions, are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its net investment hedges within the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness based on changes in forward rates. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from net investment hedges for the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 or 2015 . The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2017 . Undesignated Derivative Instruments The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/or the embedded derivative contracts. These forwards are not designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, these undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net , together with the re-measurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position or embedded derivative contract. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from undesignated instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $10.5 billion as of May 31, 2017 . Embedded Derivatives As part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related purchase order and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net , from the date a purchase order is accepted by a factory through the date the purchase price is no longer subject to foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts. These payment terms expose NIKE to variability in foreign exchange rates and create embedded derivative contracts that must be bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as derivative assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding changes in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net until each payment is settled. At May 31, 2017 , the total notional amount of all embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $265 million . Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. However, this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored. The Companys derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Companys bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require the owing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of  $50 million  should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than  $50 million . Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also trigger collateral requirements. As of May 31, 2017 , the Company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features and had derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position of $59 million . However, no derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position were greater than $50 million by counterparty. Accordingly, the Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features. Further, as of May 31, 2017 , the Company had received no cash collateral from various counterparties to its derivative contracts (refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements ). Given the considerations described above, the Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be  immaterial . ##TABLE_START NOTE 17  Operating Segments and Related Information ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. In June 2017, NIKE, Inc. announced a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. As a result of this organizational realignment, beginning in fiscal 2018, the Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand will be: North America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific and Latin America. The Companys NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer (DTC) operations are, and will continue to be, managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company, and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Global Brand Divisions is included within the NIKE Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. Global Brand Divisions primarily represents NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment, and demand creation, operating overhead and product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand. Corporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to the Companys headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses. The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (commonly referred to as EBIT), which represents Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entitys functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses. Accounts receivable, net , Inventories and Property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below. Additions to long-lived assets as presented in the following table represent capital expenditures. ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    REVENUES       North America  $ 15,216  $ 14,764  $ 13,740 Western Europe  6,211  5,884  5,705 Central  Eastern Europe  1,487  1,431  1,421 Greater China  4,237  3,785  3,067 Japan  1,014   Emerging Markets  3,995  3,701  3,898 Global Brand Divisions    Total NIKE Brand  32,233  30,507  28,701 Converse  2,042  1,955  1,982 Corporate   (86 )  (82 ) TOTAL NIKE, INC.

Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our NIKE Direct operations), to retail accounts and a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment products are produced both in the United States and abroad. ##TABLE_START Products ##TABLE_END We focus our NIKE Brand product offerings in six key categories: Running, NIKE Basketball, the Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Training and Sportswear (our sports-inspired lifestyle products). We also market products designed for kids, as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as American football, baseball, cricket, lacrosse, skateboarding, tennis, volleyball, wrestling, walking and outdoor activities. NIKEs athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products. Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand are currently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales. We also sell sports apparel covering the above-mentioned categories, which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use and exemplifies our commitment to innovation and high-quality construction. Sportswear, Training and Running are currently our top-selling apparel categories and we expect them to continue to lead in apparel sales. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in collections of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos. We sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc., doing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation. Our Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results for Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. One of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis. Another of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Hurley, headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the Hurley trademark. Sales and operating results for Hurley products are included within the NIKE Brands North America geographic operating segment. In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our NIKE Direct operations, we have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities. ##TABLE_START Sales and Marketing ##TABLE_END Financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in Note 17  Operating Segments and Related Information of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, operating and logistics-related factors. Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors. We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. In June 2017, we announced a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. As a result of this organizational realignment, the Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East  Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific  Latin America (APLA), and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. Sales through our NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Converse direct to consumer operations, including digital commerce, are reported within the Converse operating segment results. ##TABLE_START United States Market ##TABLE_ENDFor fiscal 2018 , NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 42% of total revenues, compared to 46% and 47% for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 , respectively. We sell our NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to thousands of retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit such sales. During fiscal 2018 , our three largest customers accounted for approximately 21% of sales in the United States. Our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to consumers through various digital platforms. In addition, our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell through the following number of retail stores in the United States: ##TABLE_START U.S. Retail Stores Number NIKE Brand factory stores NIKE Brand in-line stores (including employee-only stores) Converse stores (including factory stores) Hurley stores (including factory and employee stores) TOTAL ##TABLE_ENDIn the United States, NIKE has seven significant distribution centers. Five are located in Memphis, Tennessee, two of which are owned and three of which are leased. Two other distribution centers, one located in Indianapolis, Indiana, and one located in Dayton, Tennessee, are leased and operated by third-party logistics providers. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California distribution center, which we lease. Smaller leased, and third-party leased and operated, distribution facilities are located in various parts of the United States. ##TABLE_START International Markets ##TABLE_ENDFor fiscal 2018 , non-U.S. NIKE Brand and Converse sales accounted for approximately 58% of total revenues, compared to 54% and 53% for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 , respectively. We sell our products to retail accounts, through our own NIKE Direct operations and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives around the world. We sell to thousands of retail accounts and ship products from 62 distribution centers outside of the United States. During fiscal 2018 , NIKEs three largest customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 13% of total non-U.S. sales. In addition to NIKE and Converse owned digital commerce platforms in over 45 countries, our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer businesses operate the following number of retail stores outside the United States: ##TABLE_START Non-U.S. Retail Stores Number NIKE Brand factory stores NIKE Brand in-line stores (including employee-only stores) Converse stores (including factory stores) TOTAL ##TABLE_ENDInternational branch offices and subsidiaries of NIKE are located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Macau, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and Vietnam. ##TABLE_START Significant Customer ##TABLE_ENDNo customer accounted for 10% or more of our worldwide net revenues during fiscal 2018 . ##TABLE_START Product Research, Design and Development ##TABLE_ENDWe believe our research, design and development efforts are key factors in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, while reducing waste. In addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs, materials, concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process. As we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories. Using market intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumer preferences. The proliferation of NIKE Air, Lunar, Zoom, Free, Flywire, Dri-Fit, Flyknit, Flyweave, ZoomX, React and NIKE+ technologies throughout our Running, NIKE Basketball, Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Training and Sportswear categories, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products. ##TABLE_START Manufacturing ##TABLE_ENDWe are supplied by 124 footwear factories located in 13 countries. The largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 9% of total fiscal 2018 NIKE Brand footwear production. Virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories. For fiscal 2018 , contract factories in Vietnam, China and Indonesia manufactured approximately 47%, 26% and 21% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. We also have manufacturing agreements with independent contract manufacturers in Argentina, India, Brazil, Mexico and Italy to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. For fiscal 2018 , five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 69% of NIKE Brand footwear production. We are supplied by 328 apparel factories located in 37 countries. The largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 13% of total fiscal 2018 NIKE Brand apparel production. Virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories. For fiscal 2018 , contract factories in China, Vietnam and Thailand produced approximately 26%, 18% and 10% of total NIKE Brand apparel, respectively. For fiscal 2018 , one apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more than 10% of apparel production, and the top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 47% of NIKE Brand apparel production. The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and canvas, as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2018 , Air Manufacturing Innovation, with facilities near Beaverton, Oregon and in St. Charles, Missouri, as well as independent contractors in China and Vietnam, were our suppliers of the Air-Sole cushioning components used in footwear. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads (both virgin and recycled); specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware. NIKEs independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. NIKEs independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products. Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed significant import-export financing services for us. During fiscal 2018 , Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, South Africa and Uruguay, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 6% of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates. Our current agreements with Sojitz America expire on May 31, 2019. ##TABLE_START International Operations and Trade ##TABLE_ENDOur international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as the implementation of, or potential changes in, foreign and domestic trade policies, increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future. In recent years, uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional measures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE, as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole. We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. Changes in U.S. trade policies, including new and potential tariffs or penalties on imported goods, may negatively affect U.S. corporations with production activities outside the U.S., including NIKE. There have also been discussions and commentary regarding retaliatory actions by countries affected by the new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods, which could negatively affect U.S. corporations with business operations and/or consumer markets in those countries. Depending on the extent that certain new or proposed reforms are implemented by the U.S. government and the manner in which foreign governments respond to such reforms, it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business, which may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition , with respect to proposed trade restrictions targeting China, which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us, we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules and (iii) reflects and considers China  s domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community. Where trade protection measures are implemented, we believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability. NIKE advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements. Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. We source a significant portion of our products from, and have important consumer markets, outside of the United States, and we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the FCPA and similar laws by us, our employees, agents, suppliers and other partners. ##TABLE_START Competition ##TABLE_ENDThe athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment, including adidas, Anta, ASICS, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, Puma, Under Armour and V.F. Corporation, among others. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. Important aspects of competition in this industry are: ##TABLE_START  Product attributes such as quality; performance and reliability; new product innovation and development and consumer price/value. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consumer connection and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing and promotion; social media interaction; customer support and service; identification with prominent and influential athletes, public figures, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and online. ##TABLE_END We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas. ##TABLE_START Trademarks and Patents ##TABLE_ENDWe believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success and our competitive position. We pursue available protections of these rights and vigorously protect them against third-party theft and infringement. We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have sought and obtained trademark registrations. We have copyright protection in our design, graphics and other original works. In some instances, we also obtain registered copyrights. We own patents and have a license under other patents, which facilitate our use of Air technologies. We file for, own and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility patents, as well as many U.S. and foreign design patents protecting components, technologies, materials, manufacturing techniques, features, functionality, and industrial and aesthetic designs used in and for the manufacture of various athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, athletic equipment and digital devices and related software applications. These patents expire at various times. We believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patent and trade secret positions. However, we have followed a policy of filing patent applications in the United States and select foreign countries on inventions, designs and improvements that we deem valuable. We also continue to vigorously protect our trademarks and patents against third-party infringement. ##TABLE_START Employees ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2018 , we had approximately 73,100 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. Management is committed to maintaining an environment where all NIKE employees have the opportunity to reach their full potential. None of our employees are represented by a union, except for certain employees in the Asia Pacific  Latin America geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into and/or comply with industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements. ##TABLE_START Executive Officers of the Registrant ##TABLE_ENDThe executive officers of NIKE, Inc. as of July 24, 2018 are as follows: Mark G.

Risk Factors Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Analyst Reports Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historic information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKEs business plans, objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports, filings with the SEC, press releases, conferences or otherwise, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain the words believe, anticipate, expect, estimate, project, will be, will continue, will likely result or words or phrases of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the SEC, including reports filed on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, and include, among others, the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear, apparel and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products; difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for NIKE products and the various market factors described above; difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining NIKEs increasingly complex information technology systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control; interruptions in data and information technology systems; consumer data security; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes in shipment timing, the changing mix of orders with shorter lead times, and discounts, order cancellations and returns; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKEs products; increases in the cost of materials, labor and energy used to manufacture products; new product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; product performance and quality; customer service; adverse publicity, including without limitation, through social media or in connection with brand damaging events; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors and licensees; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in NIKEs debt ratings; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, including, without limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, inflation, import duties, tariffs, quotas, political and economic instability and terrorism; the impact of recent U.S. tax reform legislation on our results of operations; the potential impact of new laws, regulations or policy, including, without limitation, tariffs, import/export, trade and immigration regulations or policies; changes in government regulations; the impact of, including business and legal developments relating to, climate change and natural disasters; litigation, regulatory proceedings and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and any negative public perception with respect to key personnel; the effects of NIKEs decision to invest in or divest of businesses and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKEs business and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks, nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on NIKEs business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKEs policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE. Our products face intense competition. NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products. Our NIKE Direct operations, both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores, also compete with multi-brand retailers selling our products. Product offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, customer service, digital commerce platforms and social media presence are areas of intense competition. This, in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. In addition, the competitive nature of retail including shifts in the ways in which consumers are shopping, and the rising trend of digital commerce, constitutes a risk factor implicating our NIKE Direct and wholesale operations. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly. Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business. Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, product innovation and product quality. Our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design (including materials) and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives. Our brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity and brand culture. Negative claims or publicity involving us, our products or any of our key employees, endorsers, sponsors or suppliers could seriously damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. Social media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could also damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. If the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits. Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media, mobile applications and online advertising. If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our products. Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products. Research and development play a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting-edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could harm our business. We establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, as well as other public figures, to develop, evaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with consumers. However, as competition in our industry has increased, the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased. If we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, or other public figures, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the high visibility or on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. As a result, our brands, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be harmed. Furthermore, if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues, or other endorsers, associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues, or endorsers, could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes, or public figures, to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes, public figures, and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability. General economic factors beyond our control, and changes in the global economic environment, including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates, could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings. A majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States, and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to the volatility of global economic conditions, including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdoms impending exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit and new or proposed U.S. policy changes. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities. Global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world, most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies. If global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition: ##TABLE_START  Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts, increased inventories and lower gross margins. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We conduct transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies, including in response to certain policies advocated or implemented by the U.S. presidential administration, could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum derivatives) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products. ##TABLE_END Our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events, such as the NBA Finals, Olympics or the World Cup, among others. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, availability of import quotas, transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers. We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products. Failure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins, reduced cash flows and harm to our business. To meet anticipated demand for our products, we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer, distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance. Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products. The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retailers with many stores. These retailers have in the past increased their market share by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. These situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity or consumer behavior shifts away from traditional retail, it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. In addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues. Our NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Our NIKE Direct stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our NIKE Direct operations, a decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and-mortar retail, or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs. Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Companys control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud; mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation. In addition, extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business. If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected. Many of our customers shop with us through our digital platforms. Increasingly, customers are using mobile-based devices and applications to shop online with us and with our competitors, and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands. Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business. We periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products. The actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others. We also may be unable to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights. We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe on their intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, use, importation and/or sale of certain products. We take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights. These actions include contractual measures such as entering into non-disclosure and non-compete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential information awareness training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective. For example, confidential information related to business strategy, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, a decline in our stock price and/or a negative impact on our market position, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties or injunctions. In addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, including outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. We are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands. We currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. If our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships, supplier relationships or credit risks, it could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. We also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees. The misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us. We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results, operations or reputation. In addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information, we collect transactional and personal information about our customers and users of our digital experiences, which include online distribution channels and product engagement and personal fitness applications. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Any breach of our or our service providers network, or other vendor systems, may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data, misappropriation of our consumers, users or employees personal information or a disruption of our business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, including unwanted media attention, impairment of our consumer and customer relationships, damage to our reputation; resulting in lost sales and consumers, fines, lawsuits, or significant legal and remediation expenses. We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to and/or redress problems caused by any breach. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR imposes additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. Compliance with existing, proposed and recently enacted laws (including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements called for under GDPR) and regulations can be costly; any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits. Failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct, local laws and other standards could harm our business. We work with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to manufacture our products, and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property. We require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental, health and safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety. Notwithstanding their contractual obligations, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licenses. Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business. Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products. This includes, for example, the uncertainty surrounding the effect of Brexit, including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union, as well as new and proposed changes affecting tax laws and trade policy in the U.S. and elsewhere as further described below under  We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws, additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate  and  Changes to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations .  The U.S. presidential administration has indicated a focus on policy reforms that discourage U.S. corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions, including through tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the U.S., which may require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations. The administration has also targeted the specific practices of certain U.S. multinational corporations in public statements which, if directed at us, could harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business. In addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws, additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate. We are subject to the tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), which includes a number of significant changes to previous U.S. tax laws that impact us, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, among other changes. The Tax Act also transitions U.S. international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings, which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. taxation. Implementation of the Tax Act required us to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018, which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018. Adjustments to the incremental provisional tax expense may be made in future periods as actual amounts may differ due to, among other factors, a change in interpretation of the applicable revisions to the U.S. tax code and related tax accounting guidance, changes in assumptions made in developing these estimates, regulatory guidance that may be issued with respect to the applicable revisions to the U.S. tax code, and state tax implications. As we complete our analysis of the Tax Act, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts we have recorded, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations or financial condition. Changes or challenges to or the repeal of the Tax Act cannot be predicted with certainty and could have a material impact on our future tax expense. We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions. There have been proposals to reform foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows. Portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings that expire in whole or in part from time to time. These tax holidays and rulings may be extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not met. If the tax holidays and rulings are not extended, or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate, our effective income tax rate would increase in the future. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals, particularly in light of the enactment of the Tax Act. The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates. Changes to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the U.S. as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. The U.S. presidential administration has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes. As a result of recent policy changes of the U.S. presidential administration and recent U.S. government proposals, there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. The new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods. The Company, similar to many other multinational corporations, does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the U.S. and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements, or economic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. As part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default, or our assets deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty, may be limited by the counterpartys liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. We rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products. NIKE is supplied by 124 footwear factories located in 13 countries. We do not own or operate any of the footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell. In fiscal 2018 , five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of fiscal 2018 footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69% of NIKE Brand footwear production in fiscal 2018 . Our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers. If one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship, including due to changes in applicable trade policies, we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing. The principal materials used in our apparel products  natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat or repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware  are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. The principal materials used in our footwear products  natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, nylon, canvas and polyurethane films  are also locally available to manufacturers. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate, train, employ and retain adequate personnel. NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured. There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all. Further, our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future, unexpected increases in work wages, whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short- and long-term. Because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers, could adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air freight, which could adversely affect our profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins. Changes in U.S. trade policies, including new and potential changes to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could also have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions, and could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, Sojitz America performs significant import-export financing services for the Company. During fiscal 2018, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, South Africa and Uruguay (collectively the Sojitz Markets), excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the Sojitz Markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. Our success depends on our global distribution facilities. We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, particularly in emerging markets, depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities. We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. We are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party services (Information Technology Systems), across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities. Information Technology Systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems. Over a number of years, we have implemented Information Technology Systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Our work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to invest in these efforts. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions or other causes, or failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade systems, or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. We also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans, or those of our vendors, do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. Furthermore, we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection for digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Any interruption in Information Technology Systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss of users. The market for prime real estate is competitive. Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, both domestically and internationally, depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases. In addition, from time to time, we seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition or close some of our real estate locations, which may require modification of an existing lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, customers, distribution centers and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. From time to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses, product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses, such as our digital commerce operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost-effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability; however, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business. The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. We are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world, we are subject to extensive laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels. We are involved in various types of claims, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business, our products and the actions of our employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties, or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation. The global nature of our business means legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time, which could adversely affect us. In addition, the adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks. Any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. The success of our business depends, in part, on high-quality employees, including key personnel. Our success depends in part on the continued service of high-quality employees, including key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of key individuals, or any negative perception with respect to these individuals, could harm our business. Our success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. In addition, shifts in U.S. immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the U.S. The sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock. As of June 30, 2018, Swoosh, LLC beneficially owned more than 77% of our Class A Common Stock. If, on June 30, 2018, all of these shares were converted into Class B Common Stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 17%. The shares are available for resale, subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H. Knight, our Chairman Emeritus, to hold the majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock. Swoosh, LLC is controlled by Mr. Knight's son and NIKE director, Travis Knight. Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options. Our long-term debt is currently rated Investment Grade by Standard  Poors and Moodys Investors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default, and as a result, the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt. If our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results could be adversely affected. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, contingent payments under endorsement contracts, accounting for property, plant and equipment and definite-lived assets, hedge accounting for derivatives, stock-based compensation, income taxes and other contingencies. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock. Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock. There are provisions within our articles of incorporation and Oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, a freeze-out statute, two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company. We may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline. Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts estimates of our future performance. Analysts estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stock price is volatile for any reason, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in reputational damage, substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources needed to successfully run our business. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. ", "2": " ITEM 2. Properties The following is a summary of principal properties owned or leased by NIKE: The NIKE World Campus, owned by NIKE and located near Beaverton, Oregon, USA, is an approximately 400-acre site consisting of over 40 buildings which, together with adjacent leased properties, functions as our world headquarters and is occupied by approximately 11,200 employees engaged in management, research, design, development, marketing, finance and other administrative functions serving nearly all of our divisions. We also lease various office facilities in the surrounding metropolitan area. We lease a similar, but smaller, administrative facility in Hilversum, the Netherlands, which serves as the headquarters for the Europe, Middle East  Africa geography and management of certain brand functions for our non-U.S. operations. We also lease an office complex in Shanghai, China, our headquarters for Greater China, occupied by employees focused on implementing our wholesale, NIKE Direct and merchandising strategies in the region, among other functions. In the United States, NIKE has seven significant distribution centers. Five are located in Memphis, Tennessee, two of which are owned and three of which are leased. Two other distribution centers, one located in Indianapolis, Indiana, and one located in Dayton, Tennessee, are leased and operated by third-party logistics providers. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California distribution center, which we lease. Smaller leased, and third-party leased and operated, distribution facilities are located in various parts of the United States. NIKE has several distribution facilities outside the United States, some of which are leased and operated by third-party logistics providers. The most significant distribution facilities outside the United States are located in Laakdal, Belgium; Taicang, China; Tomisato, Japan and Incheon, Korea, all of which we own. Air Manufacturing Innovation manufactures Air-Sole cushioning components at NIKE-owned facilities and one leased facility located near Beaverton, Oregon and in St. Charles, Missouri. Air Manufacturing Innovation also manufactures and sells small amounts of various other plastic products to other manufacturers. Aside from the principal properties described above, we lease many offices worldwide for sales and administrative purposes.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our NIKE Direct operations), to retail accounts and a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, must have products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail. In June 2017, we announced the Consumer Direct Offense, a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. Leveraging the power of digital, NIKE plans to drive growth  by accelerating innovation and product creation, moving even closer to the consumer through key cities, and deepening one-to-one connections. As a result of this organizational realignment, beginning in fiscal 2018, the Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East  Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific  Latin America (APLA). Through the Consumer Direct Offense, we are focusing on our Triple Double strategy, with the objective of doubling the impact of innovation, increasing our speed to market and growing our direct connections with consumers. As a result of the execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2023, on average, per year, are as follows: ##TABLE_START  High single-digit revenue growth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Gross margin expansion of as much as 50 basis points ; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Slight selling and administrative expense leverage; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Mid-teens earnings per share growth; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Low-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital. ##TABLE_END Over the past ten years, we have achieved strong growth in many of these metrics. During this time, revenues for NIKE, Inc. have grown 7% on an annual compounded basis, annual gross margin has ranged from 43.5% to 46.4%, diluted earnings per common share has grown steadily and our return on invested capital has been as high as 34.7%. Our fiscal 2018 results demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to generate revenue growth, while investing in capabilities in support of our Triple Double strategy to fuel our next phase of long-term growth and profitability. We achieved record revenues for fiscal 2018, growing 6% to $36.4 billion. The NIKE Brand, which represents over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues , delivered 7% revenue growth. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand revenues grew 5%, driven by strong revenue growth across all international geographies and NIKE Direct, as well as growth in footwear, apparel and most key categories. Revenues for Converse decreased 8% and 11% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, primarily driven by lower revenues in North America. Income before income taxes decreased 11% for fiscal 2018, in part reflecting the negative impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates. Revenue growth was more than offset by higher selling and administrative expense, gross margin contraction, and a shift to other expense, net from other income, net for fiscal 2017. NIKE, Inc. gross margin decreased 80 basis points primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate headwinds. Selling and administrative expense was higher as a percent of revenues, reflecting investments in digital capabilities, consumer experiences and product and brand marketing to drive long-term growth under the Consumer Direct Offense. Diluted earnings per common share reflects a 2% decline in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program. While foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. Additionally, currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company  s performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. However, references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. ##TABLE_START Results of Operations ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data)  Fiscal 2018  Fiscal 2017  % Change  Fiscal 2016  % Change Revenues  $ 36,397  $ 34,350  %  $ 32,376  % Cost of sales  20,441  19,038  %  17,405  % Gross profit  15,956  15,312  %  14,971  % Gross margin  43.8 %  44.6 %    46.2 %   Demand creation expense  3,577  3,341  %  3,278  % Operating overhead expense  7,934  7,222  %  7,191  % Total selling and administrative expense  11,511  10,563  %  10,469  % % of revenues  31.6 %  30.8 %    32.3 %   Interest expense (income), net        Other expense (income), net   (196 )    (140 )   Income before income taxes  4,325  4,886  %  4,623  % Income tax expense  2,392   %   % Effective tax rate  55.3 %  13.2 %    18.7 %   NET INCOME  $ 1,933  $ 4,240  %  $ 3,760  % Diluted earnings per common share  $ 1.17  $ 2.51  %  $ 2.16  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Consolidated Operating Results ##TABLE_ENDRevenues ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 (1) % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes (2) Fiscal 2016 (1) % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes (2) NIKE, Inc.

Revenues grew 4% for fiscal 2018, driven by growth in the NIKE Brand. All international NIKE Brand geographies delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2018 as our Consumer Direct Offense delivered innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers through digital platforms and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores, driving demand for NIKE Brand products. Revenue growth was broad-based, as Greater China, EMEA and APLA each contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. Revenues . For fiscal 2018, lower revenues from North America and Converse each reduced NIKE, Inc. Revenues by approximately 1 percentage point. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 4% and 9%, respectively, for fiscal 2018, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 4%. On a category basis, the increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues was due to strong growth in Sportswear and Running, which was partially offset by lower revenues in several other categories, most notably the Jordan Brand. Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2018 increased 2% and higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business. The currency-neutral increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2018 was fueled by growth in nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear, NIKE Basketball and Football (Soccer). Unit sales of apparel increased 4% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher ASPs from full-price, off-price and NIKE Direct sales. For fiscal 2018, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 30% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 28% for fiscal 2017. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 12% for fiscal 2018, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 25%, the addition of new stores and 4% comparable store sales growth. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. On a reported basis, digital commerce sales, which are not included in comparable store sales, were $2.8 billion for fiscal 2018 compared to $2.2 billion for fiscal 2017, and represented approximately 27% of our total NIKE Brand NIKE Direct revenues for fiscal 2018 compared to 24% for fiscal 2017. On a wholesale equivalent and currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2018 NIKE Brand Mens revenues increased 5%, as growth in Sportswear, Running and NIKE Basketball more than offset lower Football (Soccer) and Jordan Brand revenues. Womens revenues increased 2%, led by growth in Sportswear, partially offset by a decline in Training. Revenues for our Young Athletes business decreased 1%, as growth in Football (Soccer), was more than offset by lower revenues in the Jordan Brand. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016  On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 8% for fiscal 2017, driven by higher revenues for all NIKE Brand geographies and Converse. Revenue growth was broad-based, as EMEA, Greater China, APLA and North America each contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. Revenues . On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 8% and 9%, respectively, for fiscal 2017, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 3%. On a category basis, the increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues was driven by strong growth in Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand. Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2017 increased 7%, with higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 1 percentage point of footwear revenue growth, primarily driven by higher full-price and off-price ASPs, partially offset by the impact of higher off-price sales. The currency-neutral increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2017 was fueled by growth in all key categories, led by Sportswear, Running and Training. Unit sales of apparel increased 6%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and, to a lesser extent, growth in our higher-priced NIKE Direct business. For fiscal 2017, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 28% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 26% for fiscal 2016. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 18% for fiscal 2017, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 30%, the addition of new stores and 7% comparable store sales growth. On a reported basis, digital commerce sales, which are not included in comparable store sales, were $2.2 billion for fiscal 2017 compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2016 and represented approximately 24% of our total NIKE Direct revenues for fiscal 2017 compared to 22% for fiscal 2016. On a wholesale equivalent and currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2017 NIKE Brand Mens revenues increased 6%, driven by significant growth in Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand, while Women  s revenues increased 8%, led by growth in Sportswear and Running. Revenues for our Young Athletes  business increased 8%, with growth across multiple categories, most notably the Jordan Brand.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Demand creation expense by approximately 3 percentage points for fiscal 2018. Operating overhead expense increased 10% compared to fiscal 2017, due to higher administrative costs, continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business and one-time wage-related costs associated with the Consumer Direct Offense organizational realignment. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Operating overhead expense by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016  Demand creation expense increased 2% for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, driven by higher sports marketing costs, as well as higher marketing and advertising costs, primarily to support key sporting events including the Rio Olympics and European Football Championship. These increases were partially offset by lower retail brand presentation costs. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced Demand creation expense by approximately 1 percentage point. Operating overhead expense was flat compared to fiscal 2016 as continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business were offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced Operating overhead expense by approximately 1 percentage point for fiscal 2017.

Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017  Other expense (income), net changed from $196 million of other income, net for fiscal 2017 to $66 million of other expense, net for fiscal 2018, primarily due to a $287 million net detrimental change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $110 million for fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016  Other expense (income), net increased from $140 million of other income, net for fiscal 2016 to $196 million of other income, net for fiscal 2017, primarily due to a $56 million net beneficial change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $59 million for fiscal 2017. Income Taxes ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2018  Fiscal 2017  % Change  Fiscal 2016  % Change Effective tax rate  55.3 %  13.2 %  4,210 bps  18.7 %  (550 ) bps ##TABLE_ENDFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017  Our effective tax rate was 55.3% for fiscal 2018, reflecting the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The impact of the Tax Act primarily reflects provisional expense of $1,875 million for the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and $158 million resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The remaining provisions of the Tax Act, which were a net benefit to the effective tax rate, did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements during fiscal 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate resulting from the Tax Act was partially offset by the tax benefit from stock-based compensation in the current period as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Refer to Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impact of ASU 2016-09, and Note 9  Income Taxes for additional information on the impact of the Tax Act. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016  The 550 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to a one-time benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the IRS of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the United States. ##TABLE_START Operating Segments ##TABLE_ENDOur operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Companys internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East  Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific  Latin America, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Companys NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.

Consumers are demanding a constant flow of fresh and innovative product, and have an expectation for superior service and real-time delivery, all fueled by the shift toward digital. Specifically, in North America we anticipate continued evolution within the retail landscape, driven by shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels. The evolution of the North America marketplace has resulted in third-party retail store closures; however, we are currently seeing stabilization and momentum building in our business, fueled by innovative product and NIKE Brand consumer experiences, leveraging digital. Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 North America revenues decreased 2%, as growth in our Sportswear and NIKE Basketball categories was more than offset by declines in all other categories, most notably the Jordan Brand and Running. NIKE Direct revenues increased 5% for fiscal 2018 due to digital commerce sales growth and the addition of new stores. Footwear revenues declined 4% for fiscal 2018, as lower revenues in nearly all categories, most notably the Jordan Brand, more than offset higher revenues in Sportswear. Unit sales of footwear decreased 5%, while ASP per pair contributed approximately 1 percentage point of footwear growth, driven by the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business. Apparel revenue growth of 1% for fiscal 2018 was attributable to higher revenues in our Sportswear and NIKE Basketball categories, which was only partially offset by declines in nearly all other categories. Unit sales of apparel decreased 4%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business and, to a lesser extent, higher full-price ASP and favorable changes in off-price sales. EBIT declined 7% for fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin declined 10 basis points as lower full-price ASP more than offset the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business. Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher operating overhead expense resulting from continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business. Demand creation expense also increased, as higher sports marketing costs were only partially offset by lower retail brand presentation costs. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016  North America revenues increased 3%, driven by growth in our Sportswear and Jordan Brand categories, partially offset by declines in other categories, including NIKE Basketball. NIKE Direct revenues increased 9% for fiscal 2017 due to digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 3%. Footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2017 was attributable to higher revenues in our Sportswear and Jordan Brand categories, partially offset by declines in other categories. Unit sales of footwear increased 4%, while ASP per pair was flat as higher off-price ASP was offset by unfavorable off-price mix. The increase in apparel revenues for fiscal 2017 was due to growth concentrated in Sportswear, partially offset by declines in other categories. Unit sales of apparel grew 2% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP. EBIT grew 3% for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin increased 10 basis points as higher full-price ASP and favorable off-price margin more than offset higher product costs and increased off-price mix as a result of clearing excess inventories through off-price channels, including through our NIKE Direct business. Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher operating overhead as continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business were partially offset by lower bad debt expense. Demand creation was flat as higher sports marketing and retail brand presentation costs offset lower marketing and advertising costs.

Revenues increased in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear and Football (Soccer). NIKE Direct revenues grew 13% for fiscal 2018 due to strong digital commerce sales growth, comparable store sales growth of 6% and the addition of new stores. The 6% increase in currency-neutral footwear revenues for fiscal 2018 was due to growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear. For fiscal 2018, unit sales of footwear increased 6% while ASP per pair was flat, as higher off-price ASP was offset by lower full-price ASP. Currency-neutral apparel revenues grew 16% for fiscal 2018, driven by higher revenues in all key categories, most notably Sportswear and Football (Soccer). Unit sales of apparel increased 12% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in ASP per unit was primarily attributable to higher full-price ASP. Reported EBIT increased 5% for fiscal 2018 due to revenue growth and slight selling and administrative expense leverage, which was partially offset by gross margin contraction. Gross margin declined 180 basis points as lower product costs were more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, lower full-price ASP due to product mix, and lower NIKE Direct margin. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation expense driven by sports marketing and advertising costs.

For fiscal 2017, unit sales of footwear increased 5% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 3 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business. Currency-neutral apparel revenue growth was driven by higher revenues in all key categories, most notably Sportswear and, to a lesser extent, Training and Football (Soccer). Unit sales of apparel for fiscal 2017 increased 12%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in ASP per unit was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business and higher full-price ASP. Reported EBIT decreased 16% for fiscal 2017, in part reflecting the negative impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates. Higher revenues and selling and administrative expense leverage were more than offset by significant gross margin contraction. Gross margin declined 530 basis points primarily driven by the effects of significant unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation expense, as increased sports marketing and advertising expenses more than offset lower marketing costs. Operating overhead also increased due to continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business, partially offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation costs.

Reported EBIT decreased 2%, in part reflecting the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Argentine Peso and Mexican Peso. Reported revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage were more than offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin decreased 370 basis points as higher full-price ASP was more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs primarily resulting from ongoing investments in our growing NIKE Direct business, partially offset by administrative cost efficiencies. Demand creation expense also increased as lower advertising costs were more than offset by increased marketing support for the Rio Olympics in the first quarter, as well as higher sports marketing costs.

Revenues for Global Brand Divisions are primarily attributable to NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment. Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017  Global Brand Divisions loss before interest and taxes decreased 1% for fiscal 2018 as total selling and administrative expense was largely unchanged compared to fiscal 2017. Operating overhead expense increased due to higher administrative costs, which more than offset lower wage-related expenses. Demand creation expense decreased driven by lower advertising and marketing costs, largely resulting from prior year investments to support the Rio Olympics and the European Football Championship, which were only partially offset by higher sports marketing costs. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016  Global Brand Divisions loss before interest and taxes increased 3% for fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher demand creation expense, which was only partially offset by a decline in operating overhead expense. The increase in demand creation expense was due to higher marketing and advertising expenses for key brand and sporting events, including the Rio Olympics and the European Football Championship in the first quarter. Operating overhead expense decreased as higher wage-related expenses were more than offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation.

The largest direct distribution markets are the United States, the United Kingdom and China. We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan. Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalty revenues to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 On a currency-neutral basis, revenues for Converse declined 11% for fiscal 2018. Comparable direct distribution markets (i.e., markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years) declined 12%, reducing total Converse revenues by approximately 11 percentage points for fiscal 2018. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales decreased 14%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenue growth. On a territory basis, the decrease in comparable direct distribution market revenues was primarily attributable to declines in both the United States and Europe , in part reflecting efforts to manage inventory levels in the marketplace , partially offset by revenue growth in Asia. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution increased total Converse revenues by approximately 1 percentage point for fiscal 2018. Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 14%, reducing total Converse revenues by approximately 1 percentage point, driven by lower revenues in Latin America. Reported EBIT declined 35% for fiscal 2018 driven by lower revenues, higher selling and administrative expense and, to a lesser extent, gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased 100 basis points as higher full-price ASP was more than offset by higher product costs and the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense. Higher operating overhead expense was due to continued investment in our direct to consumer business and, to a lesser extent, higher wage-related costs, while higher demand creation expense was due to increased marketing support for initiatives to drive growth. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016  On a currency-neutral basis, revenues for Converse increased 6% for fiscal 2017. Comparable direct distribution markets grew 4%, contributing approximately 4 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2017. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenue growth. On a territory basis, the increase in comparable direct distribution market revenues was primarily attributable to growth in the United States, partially offset by lower revenues in Europe. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution increased total Converse revenues by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2017, primarily driven by the market transition in Italy. Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 5%, having an insignificant impact to total Converse revenue. The decrease in comparable licensed markets revenues is primarily due to lower revenues in Latin America. Reported EBIT declined 2% for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and lower selling and administrative expense were more than offset by gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased 300 basis points as higher full-price ASP was more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs, primarily due to a shift in mix to lower margin products. Gross margin also contracted due to the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues, primarily due to market transitions. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation expense, primarily as a result of lower retail brand presentation costs, partially offset by higher advertising expense. Operating overhead increased as higher wage-related expenses were only partially offset by lower administrative costs.

The Corporate loss before interest and taxes largely consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses. In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments. Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017  For fiscal 2018, Corporates loss before interest and taxes increased $732 million primarily due to the following: ##TABLE_START  a detrimental change in net foreign currency gains and losses of $281 million related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other expense (income), net ; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  an unfavorable change of $255 million, primarily due to higher operating overhead expense driven by higher wage-related costs, in part reflecting one-time costs associated with our organizational realignment in the first half of fiscal 2018, as well as higher administrative costs; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a detrimental change of $196 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses; these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin. ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016  For fiscal 2017, Corporates loss before interest and taxes decreased $449 million primarily due to the following: ##TABLE_START  a beneficial change of $280 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses; these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a beneficial change of $115 million, primarily driven by lower variable compensation and administrative costs in operating overhead expense; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  an increase in net foreign currency gains of $54 million related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other expense (income), net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices ##TABLE_ENDOverview As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (NTC) and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements and Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded, as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end. Transactional Exposures We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: ##TABLE_START  Product Costs  NIKEs product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency result in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. ##TABLE_END In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost. ##TABLE_START 2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. ##TABLE_END For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other expense (income), net . Refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthe ning U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKEs U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost. ##TABLE_START  Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales  A portion of our EMEA geography revenues, as well as a portion of our Converse European operations revenues, are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Costs  Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through  Other expense (income), net . Refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities  Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in Other expense (income), net within our consolidated results of operations. ##TABLE_END Managing Transactional Exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements as discussed above. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in Other expense (income), net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. Translational Exposures Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a benefit of approximately $832 million and a detriment of approximately $542 million for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a benefit of approximately $177 million and a detriment of approximately $115 million for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Beginning in fiscal 2019, we anticipate the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment will change from the local currency to U.S. Dollars as the subsidiary will be operating in a hyper-inflationary market. As a result, its non-U.S. Dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities will now be subject to re-measurement and recorded in Other expense (income), net , within the Consolidated Statements of Income beginning in fiscal 2019. Although we continue to evaluate the impact, at current rates, we do not anticipate the re-measurement to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Managing Translational Exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $110 million and $59 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2018 and 2017. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017. ##TABLE_START Liquidity and Capital Resources ##TABLE_ENDCash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $4,955 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $3,846 million for fiscal 2017 . Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $3,473 million of operating cash flow for fiscal 2018 compared to $4,781 million for fiscal 2017 . The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase of $1,482 million for fiscal 2018, compared to a decrease of $935 million for fiscal 2017. Impacting the change in working capital during fiscal 2018 was the accrual of $1,172 million for the transition tax under the Tax Act, which will be paid in cash over an eight-year period. Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes for additional information on the Tax Act. Cash provided by operations was also impacted by the change in Accounts Receivable, net , which decreased $187 million , primarily due to improved collection timing, compared to an increase of $426 million in fiscal 2017. Cash provided (used) by investing activities was an inflow of $276 million for fiscal 2018 , compared to an outflow of $1,008 million for fiscal 2017 , driven primarily by the net change in short-term investments. During fiscal 2018 , the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash inflow of $1,326 million compared to an inflow of $118 million in fiscal 2017 . In fiscal 2019, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, including corporate facilities, expanding our digital capabilities and new NIKE Direct stores. We continue to expect such investments to approximate 3% to 4% of revenues, on average. Cash used by financing activities was $4,835 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $2,148 million for fiscal 2017 . The increase in Cash used by financing activities was primarily driven by $1,482 million of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2017, which did not recur in fiscal 2018. The increase in Cash used by financing activities was also impacted by increased repurchases of common stock, which resulted in a cash outflow of $4,254 million for fiscal 2018 compared to an outflow of $3,223 million for fiscal 2017 . In fiscal 2018 , we purchased 69.7 million shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock for $4,267 million (an average price of $ 61.25 per share) under the four-year, $12 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in November 2015. As of May 31, 2018, we had repurchased 149.4 million shares at a cost of $8,704 million (an average price of $58.25 per share) under this program. Although the timing and number of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions, we currently anticipate completing this program during fiscal 2019. In June 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new four-year, $15 billion program to repurchase shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock, which we anticipate will commence at the completion of our current program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceeds from debt. Capital Resources On July 21, 2016, we filed a shelf registration statement (the Shelf) with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 21, 2019. For additional detail refer to Note 8  Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On August 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one-year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. As of and for the periods ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 , we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility. We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2018 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our $2 billion commercial paper program. During the year ended May 31, 2018 , the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was $1.4 billion. As of May 31, 2018 , there were $325 million of outstanding borrowings under this program. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2019 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively. To date, in fiscal 2018, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs; however, future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. As of May 31, 2018 , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $5.2 billion , primarily consisting of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2018 , the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 33 days. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2018 , and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows: ##TABLE_START Description of Commitment  Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, (In millions)       Thereafter  Total Operating Leases  $  $  $  $  $  $ 1,608  $ 3,965 Capital Leases and Other Financing Obligations (1)        Long-Term Debt (2)       4,713  5,773 Endorsement Contracts (3)  1,391  1,306  1,158  1,266   4,438  10,501 Product Purchase Obligations (4)  4,566            4,566 Other Purchase Obligations (5)  1,437       2,646 Transition Tax Related to the Tax Act (6)        1,172 TOTAL  $ 8,236  $ 2,587  $ 2,157  $ 2,011  $ 2,112  $ 11,944  $ 29,047 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Capital leases and other financing obligations include payments related to build-to-suit lease arrangements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) The cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2018 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. ##TABLE_END In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. ##TABLE_START (4) We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our NIKE Direct in-line stores and digital commerce operations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) Other purchase obligations primarily include construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6) Represents a provisional estimate of the future cash payments due as part of the transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is reflected net of foreign tax credits we expect to utilize. Actual amounts could vary as we complete our analysis of the Tax Act. Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information. ##TABLE_END In addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes and Note 13  Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2018 . Refer to Note 7  Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. ##TABLE_START  Outstanding as of May 31, 2018 (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand $ Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2018 , the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling $165 million . These letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Companys performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. ##TABLE_START New Accounting Pronouncements ##TABLE_ENDRefer to Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards. ##TABLE_START Critical Accounting Policies ##TABLE_ENDOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit  Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. These policies require we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and digital commerce revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks. In certain countries, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. We base our estimates on (1) historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims are significantly greater or lower than established reserves, we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales . If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination. Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant amount of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorsers performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract term. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income , rather than Net income , until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income . In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Other comprehensive income into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Other comprehensive income to Other expense (income), net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Income Taxes We are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense . The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense . On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Act, which significantly changes previous U.S. tax laws, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as other changes. In accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), we recorded provisional amounts, which represent reasonable estimates of the effects of the Tax Act for which the analysis is not yet complete. As the Company completes its analysis of the Tax Act, including collecting, preparing and analyzing necessary information, performing and refining calculations and obtaining additional guidance from the U.S. Internal Revenue Services (IRS), U.S. Treasury Department, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other standard setting and regulatory bodies on the Tax Act, it may record adjustments to the provisional amounts, which may be material. In accordance with SAB 118, the Companys accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed during the measurement period, which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date. Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes  in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2018 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities. ##TABLE_START Market Risk Measurement ##TABLE_ENDWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (VaR). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $93 million and $97 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The VAR decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2018. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $260 million and $161 million during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows. Details of third-party debt are provided in the table below.

The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and include certain amounts based on our best estimates and judgments. Other financial information in this report is consistent with these financial statements. Our accounting systems include controls designed to reasonably assure assets are safeguarded from unauthorized use or disposition and provide for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These systems are supplemented by the selection and training of qualified financial personnel and an organizational structure providing for appropriate segregation of duties. An internal corporate audit department reviews the results of its work with the Audit  Finance Committee of the Board of Directors, presently comprised of three outside, independent directors. The Audit  Finance Committee is responsible for the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews, with the independent registered public accounting firm, management and the internal corporate audit staff, the scope and the results of the annual audit, the effectiveness of the accounting control system and other matters relating to the financial affairs of NIKE as the Audit  Finance Committee deems appropriate. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal corporate auditors have full access to the Audit  Finance Committee, with and without the presence of management, to discuss any appropriate matters. ##TABLE_START Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting ##TABLE_ENDManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(f) and Rule 15(d) - 15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect on the financial statements. While reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, it does not mean absolute assurance. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatement and instance of fraud. Controls are susceptible to manipulation, especially in instances of fraud caused by the collusion of two or more people, including our senior management. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2018 . PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited (1) the Consolidated Financial Statements and (2) the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2018 , as stated in their report herein. ##TABLE_START Mark G.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries  as of May 31, 2018  and 2017,  and the related  consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2018, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements).  We also have audited the Company  s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2018  and 2017 , and the results of their  operations and their  cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2018  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013)  issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based payment awards to employees as of June 1, 2017. Basis for Opinions The Company  s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company  s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated  financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated  financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated  financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated  financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated  financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /S/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Portland, Oregon July 24, 2018  We have served as the Companys auditor since 1974.  ##TABLE_START NIKE, Inc.

NIKE, Inc. portfolio brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse. The NIKE Brand is focused on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services across a wide range of sport categories, amplified with sport-inspired sportswear products carrying the Swoosh trademark, as well as other NIKE Brand trademarks. The Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. The Hurley brand is focused on surf and action sports and youth lifestyle footwear, apparel and accessories, using the Hurley trademark. Sales and operating results of Hurley brand products are reported within the NIKE Brands North America geographic operating segment. Converse designs, distributes, markets and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis. Basis of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. On November 19, 2015, the Company announced a two -for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2015. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 24, 2015. All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2018 presentation, including reclassified geographic operating segment data to reflect the changes in the Companys operating structure, which became effective on June 1, 2017. Refer to Note 17  Operating Segments and Related Information for additional information. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, management identified a misstatement related to the historical allocation of repurchases of Class B Common stock between Capital in excess of stated value and Retained earnings . The Company assessed the materiality of these misstatements on prior period financial statements in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, Materiality, codified in ASC 250, Presentation of Financial Statements, and concluded that these misstatements were not material to any prior annual or interim period. As such, the Company has revised the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2017 , and has reduced Capital in excess of stated value by $2.9 billion and increased Retained earnings by the same amount. Within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity, the Company has made corresponding revisions of $2.6 billion , $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion for the periods ended May 31, 2015, 2016 and, 2017, respectively. Revenue Recognition Wholesale revenues are recognized when title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. This occurs upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and digital commerce revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Amounts collected from customers for sales or value added tax are recorded on a net basis. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims from customers are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale. Post-invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. Estimates of discretionary discounts, returns and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and (3) estimated discounts, returns and claims expected, but not yet finalized with customers. As of May 31, 2018 and 2017 , the Companys reserve balances for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims were $675 million and $643 million , respectively. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and product design costs. Outbound shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales . Demand Creation Expense Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary product, television, digital and print advertising and media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run. Advertising media costs are expensed when the advertisement appears. Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is complete and delivered. A significant amount of the Companys promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). The Company records Demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When the Company determines payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the Companys best estimate of the endorsers performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from the Companys estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. The Company expenses these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, the Company offers minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts the Company estimates will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, the Company records the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract period. Through cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses customers for certain costs of advertising the Companys products. The Company records these costs in Demand creation expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs. This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run. Total advertising and promotion expenses, which the Company refers to as Demand creation expense, were $3,577 million , $3,341 million and $3,278 million for the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses totaled $730 million and $558 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, of which $359 million and $311 million , respectively, was recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets , and $371 million  and  $247 million , respectively, was recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets, depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Operating Overhead Expense Operating overhead expense consists primarily of wage and benefit-related expenses, research and development costs, as well as other administrative expenses, such as rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services, meetings and travel. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, money market funds, time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. Short-Term Investments Short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, time deposits and corporate debt securities, with maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase. Debt securities the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At May 31, 2018 and 2017 , the Company did not hold any short-term investments classified as trading or held-to-maturity. At May 31, 2018 and 2017 , Short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive income , unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and, therefore, classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at the date of purchase as current assets within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Companys short-term investments. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, net consist primarily of amounts receivable from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets . The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $30 million and $19 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value, and valued on either an average or a specific identification cost basis. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer, with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis. Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Companys suppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance and logistics and other handling fees. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for land improvements, buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years. Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales . Depreciation and amortization of all other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense . Software Development Costs Internal Use Software : Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 12 -year period on a straight-line basis. The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed : Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test first requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the Company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, the Company measures and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value, if any. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the C ompany determines it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, the Company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes trade names and trademarks have value to the extent their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Operating Leases The Company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space, equipment and other non-real estate assets under operating leases. Operating lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. Rent expense for non-cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, beginning with the effective lease commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Certain leases also provide for contingent rent, which is generally determined as a percent of sales in excess of specified levels. A contingent rent liability is recognized together with the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable. Fair Value Measurements The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives and available-for-sale securities. Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach). The levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: ##TABLE_START  Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2: Inputs other than observable quoted prices for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3: Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. ##TABLE_END The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Pricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and its counterparties. Level 1 investments include U.S. Treasury securities. Assets and liabilities included within Level 2 include commercial paper, U.S. Agency securities, money market funds, time deposits, corporate debt securities and derivative contracts. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs and are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. The Companys fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for additional information. Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactions Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in Total shareholders equity . The Companys global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, the impact of which is recorded in Other expense (income), net , within the Consolidated Statements of Income. Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (a component of Total shareholders equity ), Long-term debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For designated net investment hedges, this is within the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the Companys fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted under the NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan and employees purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes this fair value as Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense , as applicable, in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the vesting period using the straight-line method. Refer to Note 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for additional information on the Companys stock-based compensation programs. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense . Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes for further discussion. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards. Refer to Note 12  Earnings Per Share for further discussion. Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In February 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2018-02, Income Statement  Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income . The standard allows for reclassification of stranded tax effects on items resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) from Accumulated other comprehensive income to Retained earnings . Tax effects unrelated to the Tax Act are released from Accumulated other comprehensive income using either the specific identification approach or the portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item. The Company early adopted the ASU in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. As a result of the adoption, Retained earnings decreased by $17 million , with a corresponding increase to Accumulated other comprehensive income due to the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes for additional information on the impact of the Tax Act. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees. The Company adopted the ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The updated guidance requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies from share-based payment awards to be recorded in income tax expense in the income statement. Previously, excess tax benefits and deficiencies were recognized in shareholders equity on the balance sheet. This change is required to be applied prospectively. As a result of the adoption, during fiscal 2018, the Company recognized $230 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payment awards in Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Additionally, ASU 2016-09 modified the classification of certain share-based payment activities within the statement of cash flows, which the Company applied retrospectively. As a result, for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, the Company reclassified cash inflows of $177 million and $281 million , respectively, related to excess tax benefits from share-based payment awards, from Cash used by financing activities to Cash provided by operations , and reclassified cash outflows of $29 million and $22 million , for the respective periods, related to tax payments for the net settlement of share-based payment awards, from Cash provided by operations to Cash used by financing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , which expands and refines hedge accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedge items in the financial statements, and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The update to the standard is effective for the Company on June 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted in any interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the updated guidance, but does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory . The updated guidance requires companies to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of inventory will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The Company will adopt the standard on June 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach, with the cumulative effect of applying the new standard recognized in retained earnings at the date of adoption. Upon adoption, the Company will record a cumulative effect adjustment reducing Retained earnings , Deferred income taxes and other assets , and Prepaid expenses and other current assets by $507 million , $422 million and $45 million , respectively, and increasing Deferred income taxes and other liabilities by $40 million . In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which replaces existing lease accounting guidance. The new standard is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance will require the Company to continue to classify leases as either operating or financing, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The Company will adopt the standard on June 1, 2019. The ASU is required to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest period presented, with optional practical expedients. The Company continues to assess the effect the guidance will have on its existing accounting policies and the Consolidated Financial Statements and expects there will be an increase in assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at adoption due to the recording of right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities, which may be material. Refer to Note 15  Commitments and Contingencies for information about the Companys lease obligations. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments  Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . The updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The update to the standard is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ,  which replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. The updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires reporting companies to disclose the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company will adopt the standard on June 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard recognized in retained earnings at the date of adoption. While the Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the Companys net Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income, revenues for certain wholesale transactions and substantially all digital commerce sales will be recognized upon shipment rather than upon delivery to the customer. Accordingly, the Company will record a cumulative effect adjustment increasing Retained earnings by approximately $23 million on June 1, 2018. Additionally, provisions for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims will be recognized as accrued liabilities rather than as reductions to Accounts receivable, net ; and the estimated cost of inventory associated with the provision for sales returns will be recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining provisions of the standard are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_START NOTE 2  Inventories ##TABLE_ENDInventory balances of $5,261 million and $5,055 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, were substantially all finished goods. ##TABLE_START NOTE 3  Property, Plant and Equipment ##TABLE_ENDProperty, plant and equipment, net included the following: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   Land and improvements  $  $ Buildings  2,195  1,564 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software  4,230  3,867 Leasehold improvements  1,494  1,484 Construction in process   Total property, plant and equipment, gross  8,891  7,958 Less accumulated depreciation  4,437  3,969 TOTAL PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET  $ 4,454  $ 3,989 ##TABLE_ENDCapitalized interest was not material for the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . ##TABLE_START NOTE 4  Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill ##TABLE_ENDIdentifiable intangible assets, net consist of indefinite-lived trademarks, which are not subject to amortization, and acquired trademarks and other intangible assets, which are subject to amortization.

The Companys derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements that allow for the offset of assets and liabilities in the event of default or early termination of the contract. Any amounts of cash collateral received related to these instruments associated with the Company  s credit-related contingent features are recorded in Cash and equivalents and Accrued liabilities , the latter of which would further offset against the Companys derivative asset balance (refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives ). Any amounts of cash collateral posted related to these instruments associated with the Company  s credit-related contingent features are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets , which would further offset against the Company  s derivative liability balance (refer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives ). Cash collateral received or posted related to the Company  s credit related contingent features is presented in the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Any amounts of non-cash collateral received, such as securities, are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets pursuant to U.S. GAAP.

These securities are valued using market prices on both active markets (Level 1) and less active markets (Level 2). As of May 31, 2018 , the Company held $960 million of available-for-sale securities with maturity dates within one year and $36 million with maturity dates over one year and less than five years within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The gross realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities were immaterial for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 . Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities included in Accumulated other comprehensive income were immaterial as of May 31, 2018 and 2017 . The Company regularly reviews its available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment. For the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 , the Company did not consider its securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired, and accordingly, did not recognize any impairment losses. Included in Interest expense (income), net was interest income related to the Companys available-for-sale securities of $70 million , $27 million and $12 million for the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The Companys Level 3 assets comprise investments in certain non-marketable preferred stock. These Level 3 investments are an immaterial portion of the Companys portfolio. Changes in Level 3 investment assets were immaterial during the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 .

The Company purchases through Sojitz America certain NIKE Brand products it acquires from non-U.S. suppliers. These purchases are for products sold in certain countries in the Companys Asia Pacific  Latin America geographic operating segment and Canada, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Accounts payable to Sojitz America are generally due up to 60 days after shipment of goods from the foreign port. The interest rate on such accounts payable is the 60 -day London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as of the beginning of the month of the invoice date, plus 0.75% . As of May 31, 2018 and 2017 , the Company had $325 million outstanding under its $2 billion commercial paper program at weighted average interest rates of 1.77% and 0.86% , respectively. On August 28, 2015, the Company entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one -year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. Based on the Companys current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.455% . The facility fee is 0.045% of the total commitment. Under the committed credit facility, the Company must maintain certain financial ratios, among other things, with which the Company was in compliance at May 31, 2018 . No amounts were outstanding under the committed credit facility as of May 31, 2018 or 2017 . ##TABLE_START NOTE 8  Long-Term Debt ##TABLE_ENDLong-term debt , net of unamortized premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs, comprises the following : ##TABLE_START         Book Value Outstanding as of May 31, Scheduled Maturity (Dollars and Yen in millions)  Original Principal  Interest Rate  Interest Payments   Corporate Bond Payables: (1)(2)           May 1, 2023  $  2.25 %  Semi-Annually  $  $ November 1, 2026  $ 1,000  2.38 %  Semi-Annually   May 1, 2043  $  3.63 %  Semi-Annually   November 1, 2045  $ 1,000  3.88 %  Semi-Annually   November 1, 2046  $  3.38 %  Semi-Annually   Japanese Yen Notes: (3)           August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020   9,000  2.60 %  Quarterly   August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020   4,000  2.00 %  Quarterly   Total        3,474  3,477 Less current maturities         TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT        $ 3,468  $ 3,471 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) These senior unsecured obligations rank equally with the Companys other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) The bonds are redeemable at the Companys option up to three months prior to the scheduled maturity date for the bonds maturing in 2023 and 2026, and up to six months prior to the scheduled maturity date for the bonds maturing in 2043, 2045 and 2046, at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. Within three and six months to scheduled maturity, respectively, the bonds also feature a par call provision, which allows for the bonds to be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) NIKE Logistics YK assumed a total of 13.0 billion in loans as part of its agreement to purchase a distribution center in Japan, which serves as collateral for the loans. These loans mature in equal quarterly installments during the period August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020. ##TABLE_END The scheduled maturity of Long-term debt in each of the years ending May 31, 2019 through 2023 are $6 million , $6 million , $3 million , $0 million and $500 million , respectively, at face value. The Companys Long-term debt is recorded at adjusted cost, net of unamortized premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs. The fair value of Long-term debt is estimated based upon quoted prices for similar instruments or quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets (Level 2). The fair value of the Companys Long-term debt , including the current portion, was approximately $3,294 million at May 31, 2018 and $3,401 million at May 31, 2017 . ##TABLE_START NOTE 9  Income Taxes ##TABLE_ENDIncome before income taxes is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Income before income taxes:       United States  $  $ 1,240  $ Foreign  3,581  3,646  3,667 TOTAL INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  $ 4,325  $ 4,886  $ 4,623 ##TABLE_ENDThe provision for income taxes is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Current:       United States       Federal  $ 1,167  $  $ State    Foreign    Total  1,745   Deferred:       United States       Federal   (279 )  (57 ) State   (9 )  (16 ) Foreign    (7 ) Total   (273 )  (80 ) TOTAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE  $ 2,392  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Act, which significantly changes previous U.S. tax laws, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as other changes. Under U.S. GAAP, accounting for the effect of tax legislation is required in the period of enactment. For fiscal 2018, the change in the corporate tax rate, effective January 1, 2018, results in a blended U.S. federal statutory rate for the Company of approximately 29% . The Tax Act also includes provisions not yet effective for the Company, including a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of foreign subsidiaries, which will be effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company has made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense. A reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,     Federal income tax rate  29.2 %  35.0 %  35.0 % State taxes, net of federal benefit  1.2 %  1.1 %  1.1 % Foreign earnings  -18.4 %  -20.7 %  -18.2 % Transition tax related to the Tax Act  43.3 %   %   % Remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the Tax Act  3.7 %   %   % Excess tax benefits from share-based compensation  -5.3 %   %   % Resolution of a U.S. tax matter   %  -3.2 %   % Other, net  1.6 %  1.0 %  0.8 % EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE  55.3 %  13.2 %  18.7 % ##TABLE_ENDThe effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2018 was higher than the effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2017 primarily due to the enactment of the Tax Act, which included provisional expense of $1,875 million for the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, and $158 million due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The remaining provisions of the Tax Act, which were a net benefit to the effective tax rate, did not have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements during fiscal 2018. Additionally, the increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the tax benefit from share-based compensation in the current period as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. During the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, income tax benefits of $177 million and $281 million , respectively, attributable to employee share-based compensation were allocated to Total shareholders equity. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, beginning in fiscal 2018, income tax benefits from share-based compensation are reported in the  Consolidated Statements of Income. The effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2017 was 550 basis points lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2016 primarily due to a one-time benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the United States. In accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), the provisional amounts recorded represent reasonable estimates of the effects of the Tax Act for which the analysis is not yet complete. As the Company completes its analysis of the Tax Act, including collecting, preparing and analyzing necessary information, performing and refining calculations and obtaining additional guidance from the IRS, U.S. Treasury Department, FASB or other standard setting and regulatory bodies on the Tax Act, it may record adjustments to the provisional amounts, which may be material. In accordance with SAB 118, the Companys accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed during the measurement period, which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date. At May 31, 2018, there were no provisions for which the Company was unable to record a reasonable estimate of the impact. Transition Tax During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a provisional expense of $2,010 million related to the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, as a result of further analysis of the provisions of the Tax Act and additional guidance, this provisional tax expense decreased by $135 million . The transition tax is based on the Companys estimated total post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings at a tax rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other specified assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. The Company expects to pay the transition tax in installments over an eight -year period. Accordingly, the non-current portion of the provisional expense for the transition tax of $1,078 million , net of applicable foreign tax credits the Company expects to utilize, has been recorded in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Impact of Changes in the Tax Rate As a result of the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to be realized. The total provisional expense recorded during the period for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities was $158 million . Deferred tax assets and liabilities comprise the following:  ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)   Deferred tax assets:     Inventories  $  $ Sales return reserves   Deferred compensation   Stock-based compensation   Reserves and accrued liabilities   Net operating loss carry-forwards   Foreign tax credit carry-forwards    Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries    Other   Total deferred tax assets   1,452 Valuation allowance  (95 )  (82 ) Total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance   1,370 Deferred tax liabilities:     Foreign withholding tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  (155 )   Property, plant and equipment  (167 )  (254 ) Intangibles  (77 )  (90 ) Other  (26 )  (2 ) Total deferred tax liabilities  (425 )  (346 ) NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET  $  $ 1,024 ##TABLE_ENDThe following is a reconciliation of the changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START   As of May 31, (In millions)    Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of the period  $  $  $ Gross increases related to prior period tax positions    Gross decreases related to prior period tax positions  (12 )  (163 )  (20 ) Gross increases related to current period tax positions    Settlements    (12 )  (13 ) Lapse of statute of limitations  (20 )  (21 )  (17 ) Changes due to currency translation    (12 ) UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, END OF THE PERIOD  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDAs of May 31, 2018 , total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were $698 million , $478 million of which would affect the Companys effective tax rate if recognized in future periods. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense . The liability for payment of interest and penalties decreased by $14 million during the year ended May 31, 2018 , decreased by $38 million during the year ended May 31, 2017 and increased by $45 million during the year ended May 31, 2016 . As of May 31, 2018 and 2017 , accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $157 million and $171 million , respectively (excluding federal benefit). The Company is subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has closed all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2014, with the exception of certain transfer pricing adjustments. The Company is currently under audit by the IRS for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. The Companys major foreign jurisdictions, China and the Netherlands, have concluded substantially all income tax matters through calendar 2007 and fiscal 2012, respectively. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in the aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $163 million within the next 12 months. The Company historically provided for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they were considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At May 31, 2017, the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes had not been provided were approximately $12.2 billion . These undistributed foreign earnings were subject to the U.S. one-time mandatory transition tax and are eligible to be repatriated to the U.S. without additional U.S. tax under the Tax Act. The Company has reevaluated its historic indefinite reinvestment assertion as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act and determined that any historical or future undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested . A portion of the Companys foreign operations are benefiting from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2021 . This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The tax benefit attributable to this tax holiday was $126 million , $187 million and $173 million for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on diluted earnings per common share was $0.08 , $0.11 and $0.10 for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Deferred tax assets at May 31, 2018 and 2017 were reduced by a valuation allowance primarily relating to tax benefits of certain entities with operating losses. There was a $13 million net increase in the valuation allowance for the year ended May 31, 2018 , compared to a $30 million net increase for the year ended May 31, 2017 and $43 million net increase for the year ended May 31, 2016 . The Company no longer has recorded deferred tax assets for foreign tax credit carry-forwards; the $208 million recorded at May 31, 2017 was fully utilized to offset the impacts of transition tax. The Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of $289 million at May 31, 2018 . Such losses will expire as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ending May 31, (In millions)      2023-2039  Indefinite  Total Net operating losses  $  $  $  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START NOTE 10  Redeemable Preferred Stock ##TABLE_ENDSojitz America is the sole owner of the Companys authorized redeemable preferred stock, $1 par value, which is redeemable at the option of Sojitz America or the Company at par value aggregating $0.3 million . A cumulative dividend of $0.10 per share is payable annually on May 31 and no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock of the Company unless dividends on the redeemable preferred stock have been declared and paid in full. There have been no changes in the redeemable preferred stock in the three years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . As the holder of the redeemable preferred stock, Sojitz America does not have general voting rights, but does have the right to vote as a separate class on the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, on merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or on the sale or assignment of the NIKE trademark for athletic footwear sold in the United States. The redeemable preferred stock has been fully issued to Sojitz America and is not blank check preferred stock. The Companys articles of incorporation do not permit the issuance of additional preferred stock. ##TABLE_START NOTE 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation ##TABLE_ENDThe authorized number of shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value, and Class B Common Stock, no par value, are 400 million and 2,400 million , respectively. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors. There are no differences in the dividend and liquidation preferences or participation rights of the holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock. From time to time, the Companys Board of Directors authorizes share repurchase programs for the repurchase of Class B Common Stock. The value of repurchased shares is deducted from Total shareholders equity through allocation to Capital in excess of stated value and Retained earnings . The NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the Stock Incentive Plan) provides for the issuance of up to 718 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with equity awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. The Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance-based awards. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the Stock Incentive Plan. The committee has the authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards and the other terms and conditions of the awards. Substantially all stock option grants outstanding under the Stock Incentive Plan are granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year, vest ratably over four years and expire ten years from the date of grant. The following table summarizes the Companys total stock-based compensation expense recognized in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense , as applicable:  ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    Stock options (1)  $  $  $ ESPPs    Restricted stock    TOTAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Expense for stock options includes the expense associated with stock appreciation rights. Accelerated stock option expense is recorded for employees eligible for accelerated stock option vesting upon retirement. Accelerated stock option expense was $18 million , $14 million and $30 million for the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. ##TABLE_END As of May 31, 2018 , the Company had $195 million of unrecognized compensation costs from stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, to be recognized in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense , as applicable, over a weighted average remaining period of 2.0 years. The weighted average fair value per share of the options granted during the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , computed as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model, was $9.82 , $9.38 and $12.66 , respectively. The weighted average assumptions used to estimate these fair values are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31,     Dividend yield  1.2 %  1.1 %  1.0 % Expected volatility  16.4 %  17.4 %  23.6 % Weighted average expected life (in years)  6.0  6.0  5.8 Risk-free interest rate  2.0 %  1.3 %  1.7 % ##TABLE_ENDThe Company estimates the expected volatility based on the implied volatility in market traded options on the Companys common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. The weighted average expected life of options is based on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns. The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rate in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the options. The following summarizes the stock option transactions under the plan discussed above:  ##TABLE_START   Shares (1)  Weighted Average Option Price   (In millions)   Options outstanding May 31, 2015  116.2  $ 23.50 Exercised  (22.5 )  17.75 Forfeited  (2.3 )  39.96 Granted  20.6  56.41 Options outstanding May 31, 2016  112.0  30.38 Exercised  (17.1 )  20.42 Forfeited  (2.3 )  49.47 Granted  12.2  57.81 Options outstanding May 31, 2017  104.8  34.79 Exercised  (24.1 )  25.07 Forfeited  (4.3 )  55.31 Granted  16.8  59.08 Options outstanding May 31, 2018  93.2  $ 40.73 Options exercisable at May 31,      66.5  $ 21.48  67.9  26.03  58.5  31.60 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Includes stock appreciation rights transactions. ##TABLE_END The weighted average contractual life remaining for options outstanding and options exercisable at May 31, 2018 was 5.7 years and 4.4 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable at May 31, 2018 was $2,896 million and $2,352 million , respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value was the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of the options. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $889 million , $594 million and $946 million , respectively. In addition to the Stock Incentive Plan, the Company gives employees the right to purchase shares at a discount to the market price under employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs). Subject to the annual statutory limit, employees are eligible to participate through payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation. At the end of each six -month offering period, shares are purchased by the participants at 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or the end of the offering period. Employees purchased 3.1 million , 3.1 million and 2.5 million shares during each of the three years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. From time to time, the Company grants restricted stock and restricted stock units to key employees under the Stock Incentive Plan. The number of shares underlying such awards granted to employees during the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 were 1.8 million , 0.4 million and 1.0 million , respectively, with weighted average values per share of $62.51 , $57.59 and $54.87 , respectively. Recipients of restricted stock are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respective shares throughout the period of restriction. Recipients of restricted stock units are entitled to dividend equivalent cash payments upon vesting. The value of all grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units was established by the market price on the date of grant. During the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the aggregate fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested was $113 million , $60 million and $49 million , respectively, determined as of the date of vesting. As of May 31, 2018 , the Company had $104 million of unrecognized compensation costs from restricted stock and restricted stock units to be recognized in Operating overhead expense over a weighted average period of 2.4 years. ##TABLE_START NOTE 12  Earnings Per Share ##TABLE_ENDThe following is a reconciliation from basic earnings per common share to diluted earnings per common share. The computations of diluted earnings per common share excluded options, including shares under employee stock purchase plans, to purchase an additional 42.9 million , 30.5 million and 0.2 million shares of common stock outstanding for the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, because the options were anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions, except per share data)    Determination of shares:       Weighted average common shares outstanding  1,623.8  1,657.8  1,697.9 Assumed conversion of dilutive stock options and awards  35.3  34.2  44.6 DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING  1,659.1  1,692.0  1,742.5        Earnings per common share:       Basic  $ 1.19  $ 2.56  $ 2.21 Diluted  $ 1.17  $ 2.51  $ 2.16 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START NOTE 13  Benefit Plans ##TABLE_ENDThe Company has a qualified 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan, in which all U.S. employees are able to participate. The Company matches a portion of employee contributions to the savings plan. Company contributions to the savings plan were $80 million , $75 million and $72 million and included in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense , as applicable, for the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The terms of the plan also allow for annual discretionary profit sharing contributions, as determined by the Board of Directors, to the accounts of eligible U.S. employees who work at least 1,000 hours in a year. Profit sharing contributions of $59 million , $68 million and $64 million were made to the plan and included in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense , as applicable, for the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The Company also has a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by shareholders in September 1997 and later amended and approved in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2012. The Company recognized $33 million , $21 million and $85 million of Operating overhead expense related to cash awards under the LTIP during the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The Company allows certain highly compensated employees and non-employee directors of the Company to defer compensation under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Deferred compensation plan liabilities were $641 million and $569 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, and primarily classified as non-current in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities . The Company has pension plans in various countries worldwide. The pension plans are only available to local employees and are generally government mandated. The liability related to the unfunded pension liabilities of the plans was $70 million and $107 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, and primarily classified as non-current in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities . ##TABLE_START NOTE 14  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ##TABLE_ENDThe changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income , net of tax, were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In millions)  Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment (1)  Cash Flow Hedges  Net Investment Hedges (1)  Other  Total Balance at May 31, 2017  $ (191 )  $ (52 )  $  $ (85 )  $ (213 ) Other comprehensive income (loss):           Other comprehensive gains (losses) before reclassifications (2)  (6 )  (52 )     (56 ) Reclassifications to net income of previously deferred (gains) losses (3)        Total other comprehensive income (loss)  (6 )      Reclassifications to retained earnings in accordance with ASU 2018-02 (4)   (7 )      Balance at May 31, 2018  $ (173 )  $  $  $ (51 )  $ (92 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment and net investment hedge gains/losses related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary are reclassified to Net income upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the respective entity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Net of tax benefit (expense) of $ (24) million , $ (3) million , $ 0 million , $ (4) million and $ (31) million , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Net of tax (benefit) expense of $ 0 million , $ (3) million , $ 0 million , $ 0 million and $ (3) million , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Refer to Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on the adoption of ASU 2018-02 during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (In millions)  Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment (1)  Cash Flow Hedges  Net Investment Hedges (1)  Other  Total Balance at May 31, 2016  $ (207 )  $  $  $ (53 )  $ Other comprehensive income (loss):           Other comprehensive gains (losses) before reclassifications (2)      (14 )  Reclassifications to net income of previously deferred (gains) losses (3)   (633 )    (18 )  (650 ) Total other comprehensive income (loss)   (515 )    (32 )  (531 ) Balance at May 31, 2017  $ (191 )  $ (52 )  $  $ (85 )  $ (213 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment and net investment hedge gains/losses related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary are reclassified to Net income upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the respective entity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Net of tax benefit (expense) of $ 0 million , $ 24 million , $ 0 million , $ 3 million and $ 27 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Net of tax (benefit) expense of $ 0 million , $ (3) million , $ 0 million , $ (3) million and $ (6) million , respectively. ##TABLE_ENDThe following table summarizes the reclassifications from Accumulated other comprehensive income to the Consolidated Statements of Income: ##TABLE_START   Amount of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income     Year Ended May 31, (In millions)   Gains (losses) on foreign currency translation adjustment  $   $ (1 ) Other expense (income), net Total before tax    (1 )  Tax (expense) benefit      Gain (loss) net of tax    (1 )  Gains (losses) on cash flow hedges:      Foreign exchange forwards and options   Revenues Foreign exchange forwards and options  (90 )  Cost of sales Foreign exchange forwards and options    Total selling and administrative expense Foreign exchange forwards and options  (69 )  Other expense (income), net Interest rate swaps  (7 )  (4 ) Interest expense (income), net Total before tax  (131 )   Tax (expense) benefit    Gain (loss) net of tax  (128 )   Gains (losses) on other  (32 )  Other expense (income), net Total before tax  (32 )   Tax (expense) benefit     Gain (loss) net of tax  (32 )   Total net gain (loss) reclassified for the period  $ (160 )  $  ##TABLE_ENDRefer to Note 16  Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives. ##TABLE_START NOTE 15  Commitments and Contingencies ##TABLE_ENDThe Company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space, equipment and other non-real estate assets under operating leases expiring from 1 to 17 years after May 31, 2018 .

These letters of credit were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and guarantees of the Companys performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. In connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the Companys historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of its pending legal matters with certainty, the Company does not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ##TABLE_START NOTE 16  Risk Management and Derivatives ##TABLE_ENDThe Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2018 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs . All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date. The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2018 and 2017 :  ##TABLE_START   Derivative Assets  Derivative Liabilities (In millions)  Balance Sheet Location    Balance Sheet Location   Derivatives formally designated as hedging instruments:             Foreign exchange forwards and options  Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $  $  Accrued liabilities  $  $ Foreign exchange forwards and options  Deferred income taxes and other assets    Deferred income taxes and other liabilities    Total derivatives formally designated as hedging instruments         Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:             Foreign exchange forwards and options  Prepaid expenses and other current assets    Accrued liabilities   Embedded derivatives  Prepaid expenses and other current assets    Accrued liabilities   Foreign exchange forwards and options  Deferred income taxes and other assets     Deferred income taxes and other liabilities    Embedded derivatives  Deferred income taxes and other assets    Deferred income taxes and other liabilities   Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments         TOTAL DERIVATIVES    $  $    $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe following tables present the amounts affecting the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : ##TABLE_START (In millions)  Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income on Derivatives (1)  Amount of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income (1) Year Ended May 31,  Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified From Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income  Year Ended May 31,                   Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges:               Foreign exchange forwards and options  $  $  $  Revenues  $  $  $ (88 ) Foreign exchange forwards and options  (50 )   (57 )  Cost of sales  (90 )   Foreign exchange forwards and options   (4 )    Total selling and administrative expense      Foreign exchange forwards and options  (19 )   (25 )  Other expense (income), net  (69 )   Interest rate swaps (2)    (54 )  (83 )  Interest expense (income), net  (7 )  (4 )   Total designated cash flow hedges  $ (49 )  $  $ (75 )    $ (131 )  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) For the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the amounts recorded in Other expense (income), net as a result of hedge ineffectiveness and the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because the forecasted transactions were no longer probable of occurring were immaterial. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Gains and losses associated with terminated interest rate swaps, which were previously designated as cash flow hedges and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income, will be released through Interest expense (income), net over the term of the issued debt. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivatives  Location of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivatives   Year Ended May 31,  (In millions)     Derivatives designated as fair value hedges:         Interest rate swaps (1)  $   $   $  Interest expense (income), net Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:         Foreign exchange forwards and options  (57 )  (44 )  (68 )  Other expense (income), net Embedded derivatives  $ (4 )  $ (2 )  $ (2 )  Other expense (income), net ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. Refer to Fair Value Hedges in this note for additional detail. ##TABLE_END Cash Flow Hedges All changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, excluding any ineffective portion, are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income until Net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. Effective hedge results are classified within the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts, if any, is recorded immediately in earnings. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be discontinued when it is no longer probable the forecasted hedged transaction will occur in the initially identified time period. The gains and losses associated with discontinued derivative instruments in Accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in  Other expense (income), net , if it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the initially identified time period or within an additional two -month period thereafter. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will account for the derivative as an undesignated instrument as discussed below. The purpose of the Company  s foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Company  s consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency exposures the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external and intercompany revenues, selling and administrative expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions. Product cost exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below. NIKE entities primarily purchase products in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities  purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a wholly owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the product to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. The Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the Company  s existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, the Companys payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order. Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below. The Companys policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $12.2 billion as of May 31, 2018 . As of May 31, 2018 , $96 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income . Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2018 , the maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 24 months. Fair Value Hedges The Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method requirements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 or 2016 . The Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31, 2018. Net Investment Hedges The Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges, except ineffective portions, are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts, if any, are recorded immediately in earnings. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from net investment hedges for the years ended May 31, 2018 , 2017 or 2016 . The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2018 . Undesignated Derivative Instruments The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/or the embedded derivative contracts. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other expense (income), net , together with the re-measurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position and/or embedded derivative contract. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $6.1 billion as of May 31, 2018 . Embedded Derivatives As part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. In addition, embedded derivative contracts are created when the Company enters into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts. Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related purchase order and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other expense (income), net , through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist. At May 31, 2018 , the total notional amount of all embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $260 million . Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings; however, this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored. The Companys derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Companys bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require the owing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of  $50 million  should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than  $50 million . Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also trigger collateral requirements. As of May 31, 2018 , the Company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features and had no derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position. Accordingly, the Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features. Further, as of May 31, 2018 , the Company had received $23 million of cash collateral from various counterparties to its derivative contracts (refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements ). The Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be  immaterial . ##TABLE_START NOTE 17  Operating Segments and Related Information ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Companys internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. In June 2017, NIKE, Inc. announced a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. As a result of this organizational realignment, the Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East  Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific  Latin America, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2018 presentation. This includes reclassified operating segment data to reflect the changes in the Companys operating structure, which became effective June 1, 2017. These changes had no impact on previously reported consolidated statements of income, balance sheets, statements of cash flows or statements of shareholders equity. The Companys NIKE Direct operations are managed within each NIKE Brand geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company, and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Global Brand Divisions is included within the NIKE Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. Global Brand Divisions primarily represents NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment, and demand creation, operating overhead and product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand. Corporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to the Companys headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses. The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (commonly referred to as EBIT), which represents Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As part of the Companys centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Companys geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entitys functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the Companys centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses. Accounts receivable, net , Inventories and Property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and, therefore, are provided below. Additions to long-lived assets as presented in the following table represent capital expenditures. ##TABLE_START   Year Ended May 31, (In millions)    REVENUES       North America  $ 14,855  $ 15,216  $ 14,764 Europe, Middle East  Africa  9,242  7,970  7,568 Greater China  5,134  4,237  3,785 Asia Pacific  Latin America  5,166  4,737  4,317 Global Brand Divisions    Total NIKE Brand  34,485  32,233  30,507 Converse  1,886  2,042  1,955 Corporate    (86 ) TOTAL NIKE, INC.

Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We carry out a variety of ongoing procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of May 31, 2018 . Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included in Item 8 of this Report. We have continued several transformation initiatives to centralize and simplify our business processes and systems. These are long-term initiatives, which we believe will enhance our internal control over financial reporting due to increased automation and further integration of related processes. We will continue to monitor our internal control over financial reporting for effectiveness throughout the transformation. There have not been any other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ", "9B": " ITEM 9B. Other Information On July 20, 2018, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of NIKE, Inc. (the Company), approved a form of discretionary performance award agreement (the DPA) to enable the Company to award cash incentives to employees in recognition of Company and individual performance. The form of DPA is intended to enhance the Companys ability to pay for performance on a case-by-case basis by supplementing the Companys existing performance-based compensation plans, including the Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the Executive Performance Sharing Plan. The foregoing is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of DPA, which is filed as Exhibit 10.22 hereto and incorporated by reference herein. Additionally, on July 20, 2018, the Committee approved awards under the form of DPA to the Companys continuing named executive officers (collectively, the Officers) as follows: Mark G. Parker, $1,295,000; Andrew Campion, $277,500; Eric D. Sprunk, $277,500; Hilary K. Krane, $185,000; and John F. Slusher, $185,000. As further described in the Companys 2018 Proxy Statement, the Committee adjusted the payouts for LTIP awards covering the fiscal 2016-2018 performance period to primarily account for the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Because the terms of the LTIP awards, as applicable to the Company's named executive officers, did not contemplate the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Committee determined to award these one-time DPA grants so as to put the Officers in the same position as the non-executive officer LTIP participants.

BUSINESS GENERAL NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the State of Oregon. As used in this report, the terms we, us, NIKE and the Company refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our NIKE digital commerce website is located at www.nike.com . On our NIKE corporate website, located at investors.nike.com , we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC): our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our definitive Proxy Statements are also posted on our corporate website. All such filings on our corporate website are available free of charge. Copies of these filings are also available on the SEC's website ( www.sec.gov ). Also available on our corporate website are the charters of the committees of our Board of Directors, as well as our corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics; copies of any of these documents will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our NIKE Direct operations), to retail accounts and a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment products are produced both in the United States and abroad. PRODUCTS We focus our NIKE Brand product offerings in six key categories: Running, NIKE Basketball, the Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Training and Sportswear (our sports-inspired lifestyle products). We also market products designed for kids, as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as American football, baseball, cricket, golf, lacrosse, skateboarding, tennis, volleyball, walking, wrestling and other outdoor activities. NIKE's athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products. Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand are currently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales. We also sell sports apparel covering the above-mentioned categories, which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use and exemplifies our commitment to innovation and high-quality construction. Sportswear, Training and Running are currently our top-selling apparel categories and we expect them to continue to lead in apparel sales. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in collections of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos. We sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc., doing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation. 2019 FORM 10-K 1 Our Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results for Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. One of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis. Another of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Hurley, headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the Hurley trademark. Sales and operating results for Hurley products are included within the NIKE Brand's North America geographic operating segment. In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our NIKE Direct operations, we have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities. SALES AND MARKETING We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, operating and logistics-related factors. Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors. We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East  Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific  Latin America (APLA), and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. Sales through our NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable operating segment and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Converse direct to consumer operations, including digital commerce, are reported within the Converse operating segment results. UNITED STATES MARKET For fiscal 2019 , NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 41% of total revenues, compared to 42% and 46% for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 , respectively. We sell our NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to thousands of retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit such sales. During fiscal 2019 , our three largest United States customers accounted for approximately 24% of sales in the United States. 2 NIKE, INC. Our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to consumers through various digital platforms. In addition, our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell through the following number of retail stores in the United States: ##TABLE_START U.S. RETAIL STORES NUMBER NIKE Brand factory stores NIKE Brand in-line stores (including employee-only stores) Converse stores (including factory stores) Hurley stores (including factory and employee-only stores) TOTAL ##TABLE_ENDIn the United States, NIKE has six significant distribution centers. Four are located in Memphis, Tennessee, two of which are owned and two of which are leased. Two other distribution centers, one located in Indianapolis, Indiana and one located in Dayton, Tennessee, are leased and operated by third-party logistics providers. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California distribution center, which we lease. Smaller leased and third-party leased and operated distribution facilities are located in various parts of the United States. INTERNATIONAL MARKETS For fiscal 2019 , non-U.S. NIKE Brand and Converse sales accounted for approximately 59% of total revenues, compared to 58% and 54% for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 , respectively. We sell our products to retail accounts, through our own NIKE Direct operations and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives around the world. We sell to thousands of retail accounts and ship products from 67 distribution centers outside of the United States. During fiscal 2019 , NIKE's three largest customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 14% of total non-U.S. sales. In addition to NIKE and Converse owned digital commerce platforms in over 45 countries, our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer businesses operate the following number of retail stores outside the United States: ##TABLE_START NON-U.S. RETAIL STORES NUMBER NIKE Brand factory stores NIKE Brand in-line stores (including employee-only stores) Converse stores (including factory stores) TOTAL ##TABLE_ENDInternational branch offices and subsidiaries of NIKE are located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Macau, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and Vietnam. SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER No customer accounted for 10% or more of our worldwide net revenues during fiscal 2019 . 2019 FORM 10-K 3 PRODUCT RESEARCH, DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT We believe our research, design and development efforts are key factors in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, while reducing waste. In addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs, materials, concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process. As we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories. Using market intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumer preferences. The proliferation of NIKE Air, Lunar, Zoom, Free, Flywire, Dri-Fit, Flyknit, Flyweave, ZoomX, React, Adaptive and NIKE+ technologies, among others, throughout our Running, NIKE Basketball, Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Training and Sportswear categories typifies our dedication to designing innovative products. MANUFACTURING We are supplied by 112 footwear factories located in 12 countries. The largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 9% of total fiscal 2019 NIKE Brand footwear production. Virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories. For fiscal 2019 , contract factories in Vietnam, China and Indonesia manufactured approximately 49%, 23% and 21% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. We also have manufacturing agreements with independent contract manufacturers in Argentina and India to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. For fiscal 2019 , four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 61% of NIKE Brand footwear production. We are supplied by 334 apparel factories located in 36 countries. The largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 14% of total fiscal 2019 NIKE Brand apparel production. Virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories. For fiscal 2019 , contract factories in China, Vietnam and Thailand produced approximately 27%, 22% and 10% of total NIKE Brand apparel, respectively. For fiscal 2019 , one apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more than 10% of apparel production, and the top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 49% of NIKE Brand apparel production. The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and canvas, as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2019 , Air Manufacturing Innovation, a wholly-owned subsidiary, with facilities near Beaverton, Oregon and in St. Charles, Missouri, as well as independent contractors in China and Vietnam, were our suppliers of the Air-Sole cushioning components used in footwear. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads (both virgin and recycled); specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware. NIKE's independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. NIKE's independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products. Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed import-export financing services for us. During fiscal 2019 , Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, South Africa and Uruguay, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 5% of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz America's banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates. 4 NIKE, INC. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as the implementation of, or potential changes in, foreign and domestic trade policies, increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future. In recent years, uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional measures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE, as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole. We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. NIKE also advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements. Changes in U.S. trade policies, including new and potential tariffs or penalties on imported goods, may negatively affect U.S. corporations with production activities outside the U.S., including NIKE. There have also been discussions and commentary regarding retaliatory actions by countries affected by the new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain U.S. goods, which could negatively affect U.S. corporations with business operations and/or consumer markets in those countries. Depending on the extent that certain new or proposed reforms are implemented by the U.S. government and the manner in which foreign governments respond to such reforms, it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business, which may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, with respect to proposed trade restrictions targeting China, which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us, we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules and (iii) reflects and considers China's domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community. Where trade protection measures are implemented, we believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability. Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or \"FCPA\", and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. We source a significant portion of our products from, and have important consumer markets, outside of the United States, and we have an ethics and compliance program to address compliance with the FCPA and similar laws by us, our employees, agents, suppliers and other partners. COMPETITION The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment, including adidas, Anta, ASICS, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, Puma, Under Armour and V.F. Corporation, among others. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. 2019 FORM 10-K 5 NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. Important aspects of competition in this industry are: ##TABLE_START  Product attributes such as quality; performance and reliability; new product innovation and development and consumer price/value. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consumer connection and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing and promotion; social media interaction; customer support and service; identification with prominent and influential athletes, public figures, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and digital platforms. ##TABLE_END We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas. TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS We believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success and our competitive position. We pursue available protections of these rights and vigorously protect them against third-party theft and infringement. We use trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh Design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we use in marketing our products. We own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have sought and obtained trademark registrations. We have copyright protection in our design, graphics and other original works. In some instances, we also obtain registered copyrights. We file for, own and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility and design patents protecting components, technologies, materials, manufacturing techniques, features, functionality, and industrial and aesthetic designs used in and for the manufacture of various athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, athletic equipment and digital devices and related software applications. These patents expire at various times. We believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing and is supported by our intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, patents and trade secrets, among others. We have followed a policy of applying for and registering intellectual property rights in the United States and select foreign countries on trademarks, inventions, innovations and designs that we deem valuable. We also continue to vigorously protect our intellectual property, including trademarks, patents and trade secrets against third-party infringement. EMPLOYEES As of May 31, 2019 , we had approximately 76,700 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. Management is committed to maintaining an environment where all NIKE employees have the opportunity to reach their full potential. None of our employees are represented by a union, except for certain employees in the APLA geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into and/or comply with industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements. 6 NIKE, INC.

RISK FACTORS Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Analyst Reports Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historic information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKE's business plans, objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports, filings with the SEC, press releases, conferences or otherwise, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain the words believe, anticipate, expect, estimate, project, will be, will continue, will likely result or words or phrases of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the SEC, including reports filed on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, and include, among others, the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear, apparel and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products; difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for NIKE products and the various market factors described above; difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining NIKE's increasingly complex information technology systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control; interruptions in data and information technology systems; consumer data security; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes in shipment timing, the changing mix of orders with shorter lead times, and discounts, order cancellations and returns; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE's products; increases in the cost of materials, labor and energy used to manufacture products; new product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; product performance and quality; customer service; adverse publicity, including without limitation, through social media or in connection with brand damaging events; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors and licensees; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in NIKE's debt ratings; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, including, without limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, inflation, import duties, tariffs, quotas, political and economic instability and terrorism; the impact of U.S. tax reform legislation on our results of operations; the potential impact of new laws, regulations or policy, including, without limitation, tariffs, import/export, trade and immigration regulations or policies; changes in government regulations; the impact of, including business and legal developments relating to, climate change and natural disasters; litigation, regulatory proceedings, sanctions or any other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and any negative public perception with respect to key personnel; the effects of NIKE's decision to invest in or divest of businesses and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE's business and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks, nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on NIKE's business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE's policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE. Our products face intense competition. NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products. Our NIKE Direct operations, both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores, also compete with multi-brand retailers selling our products. 8 NIKE, INC. Product offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, customer service, digital commerce platforms and social media presence are areas of intense competition. This, in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. In addition, the competitive nature of retail including shifts in the ways in which consumers are shopping, and the rising trend of digital commerce, constitutes a risk factor implicating our NIKE Direct and wholesale operations. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly. Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business. Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, product innovation and product quality. Our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design (including materials) and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives. Our brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity and brand culture. Negative claims or publicity involving us, our products, consumer data, or any of our key employees, endorsers, sponsors or suppliers could seriously damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. For example, while we require our suppliers of our products to operate their business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we do not control their practices. Negative publicity relating to a violation or an alleged violation of policies or laws by such suppliers could damage our brand image. Social media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could also damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. If the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity, then our sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits. Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media, mobile applications and online advertising. If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our products. Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products. Research and development play a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting-edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could harm our business. We establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, as well as other public figures, including artists, designers and influencers, to develop, evaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with consumers. However, as competition in our industry has increased, the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased. If we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional 2019 FORM 10-K 9 athletes, sports teams and leagues, or other public figures, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the high visibility or on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. As a result, our brands, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be harmed. Furthermore, if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues, or other endorsers, associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues, or endorsers, could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes, public figures or sports organizations, to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes, public figures, and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability. General economic factors beyond our control, and changes in the global economic environment, including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates, could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings. A majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States, and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to the volatility of global economic conditions, including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdom's impending exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit or new or proposed U.S. policy changes that impact the U.S. Dollar value relative to other international currencies. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities. Global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world, most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies. If global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition: ##TABLE_START  Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts, increased inventories and lower gross margins. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We conduct transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies, including in response to certain policies advocated or implemented by the U.S. presidential administration, could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum derivatives) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers. ##TABLE_END10 NIKE, INC. ##TABLE_START  If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products. ##TABLE_END Our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events, such as the NBA Finals, Olympics or the World Cup, among others. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, availability of import quotas, transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers. We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products. Failure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins, reduced cash flows and harm to our business. To meet anticipated demand for our products, we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer, distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance. Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products. The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retailers with many stores. These retailers have in the past increased their market share by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. These situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity or consumer behavior shifts away from traditional retail, it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. In addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues. 2019 FORM 10-K 11 Our NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Our NIKE Direct stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our NIKE Direct operations, a decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and-mortar retail, or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs. Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company's control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud; mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation. In addition, extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business. If the technology-based systems that give our consumers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected. Many of our consumers shop with us through our digital platforms. Increasingly, consumers are using mobile-based devices and applications to shop online with us and with our competitors, and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our consumers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with consumers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers' brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands. Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business. We periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products. The actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others. We also may be unable to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights. We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe on their intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, use, importation and/or sale of certain products. We take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights. These actions include contractual measures such as entering into non-disclosure and non-compete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential information awareness training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective. For example, confidential information related to business strategy, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely, inadvertently, or improperly used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, a decline in our stock price and/or a negative impact on our market position, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties or injunctions. In addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, including outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results, operations or reputation. In addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information, we handle transactional and personal information about our customers and users of our digital experiences, which include online distribution channels and product engagement, adaptive products and personal fitness applications. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate social 12 NIKE, INC. engineering, such as phishing, and large-scale, complex automated attacks that can evade detection for long periods of time. Any breach of our or our service providers' network, or other vendor systems, may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data, misappropriation of our consumers', users' or employees' personal information or a disruption of our business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, including unwanted media attention, impairment of our consumer and customer relationships, damage to our reputation; resulting in lost sales and consumers, fines, lawsuits, or significant legal and remediation expenses. We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to and/or redress problems caused by any breach. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018; and California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\") which will go into effect in 2020. These laws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. Compliance with existing, proposed and recently enacted laws (including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements called for under GDPR and CCPA) and regulations can be costly; any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits. We are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands. We currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. If our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships, supplier relationships or credit risks, it could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. We also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees. The misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us. Failure of our contractors or our licensees' contractors to comply with our code of conduct, local laws and other standards could harm our business. We work with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to manufacture our products, and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property. We require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental, health and safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety. Notwithstanding their contractual obligations, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licenses. Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business. Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products. This includes, for example, the uncertainty surrounding the effect of Brexit, including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union, as well as new and proposed changes affecting tax laws and trade policy in the U.S. and elsewhere as further described below under We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws, additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate and Changes to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The U.S. presidential administration has indicated a focus on policy reforms that discourage U.S. corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions, including through tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the U.S., which may require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations. The administration has also targeted the specific practices of certain U.S. multinational corporations in public statements which, if directed at us, could harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business. 2019 FORM 10-K 13 In addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws, additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate. We are subject to the tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), which includes a number of significant changes to previous U.S. tax laws that impact us, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, among other changes. The Tax Act also transitions U.S. international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings, which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. taxation. Implementation of the Tax Act required us to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018, which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018. We completed our analysis of the Tax Act in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and no adjustments were made to the provisional amounts recorded. We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions. There have been proposals to reform foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows. Portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings. We also utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters. These holidays and rulings expire in whole or in part from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not met. The impact of any changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate. For example, in January 2019, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company. If this matter is adversely resolved, the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and the Company's Netherlands income taxes in the future could increase. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates. Changes to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the U.S. as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. The U.S. presidential administration has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes. As a result of recent policy changes of the U.S. presidential administration and recent U.S. government proposals, there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. The new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy has in the past and could continue to trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted 14 NIKE, INC. or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain U.S. goods. The Company, similar to many other multinational corporations, does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the U.S. and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements, or economic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. As part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default, or our assets deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty, may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. We rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products. NIKE is supplied by 112 footwear factories located in 12 countries. We do not own or operate any of the footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell. In fiscal 2019 , four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of fiscal 2019 footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 61% of NIKE Brand footwear production in fiscal 2019 . Our ability to meet our customers' needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers. If one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship, including due to changes in applicable trade policies, we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing. The principal materials used in our apparel products  natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat or repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware  are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. The principal materials used in our footwear products  natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, nylon, canvas and polyurethane films  are also locally available to manufacturers. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate, train, employ and retain adequate personnel. NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured. There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all. Further, our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future, unexpected increases in work wages, whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short- and long-term. 2019 FORM 10-K 15 Because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers, could adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air freight, which could adversely affect our profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins. Changes in U.S. trade policies, including new and potential changes to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could also have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions, and could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, Sojitz America performs significant import-export financing services for the Company. During fiscal 2019, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, South Africa and Uruguay (collectively the Sojitz Markets), excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz America's banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the Sojitz Markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. Our success depends on our global distribution facilities. We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, particularly in emerging markets, depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities. We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. We are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party services (Information Technology Systems), across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities. Information Technology Systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems. Over a number of years, we have implemented Information Technology Systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Our work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to invest in these efforts. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions or other causes, or failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade systems, or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem which may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities, and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. We also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans, or those of our vendors, do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. Furthermore, we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection for digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Any interruption in Information Technology Systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss of users. The market for prime real estate is competitive. Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, both domestically and internationally, depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease 16 NIKE, INC. economics, demographics and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases. In addition, from time to time, we seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition or close some of our real estate locations, which may require modification of an existing lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, customers, distribution centers, headquarters and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. From time to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses, product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses, such as our digital commerce operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost-effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability; however, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business. The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. We are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world, we are subject to and must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels. If we or our employees, agents, suppliers, and other partners fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations, such failure could subject us to fines, sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. We are involved in various types of claims, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business, our products and the actions of our employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties, or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation. The global nature of our business means legal and compliance risks, such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption, fraud, trade, environmental, competition, privacy and other regulatory matters, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time, which could adversely affect us. In addition, the adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks. Any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert management's attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. The success of our business depends, in part, on high-quality employees, including key personnel. Our success depends in part on the continued service of high-quality employees, including key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of key individuals, or any negative perception with respect to these individuals, could harm our business. Our success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. In addition, shifts in U.S. immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the U.S. The sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock. As of June 30, 2019, Swoosh, LLC beneficially owned approximately 78% of our Class A Common Stock. If, on June 30, 2019, all of these shares were converted into Class B Common Stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 16%. The shares are available for resale, subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial 2019 FORM 10-K 17 number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H. Knight, our Chairman Emeritus, to hold the majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock. Swoosh, LLC is controlled by Mr. Knight's son and NIKE director, Travis Knight. Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options. Our long-term debt is currently rated Investment Grade by Standard  Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default, and as a result, the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt. If our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results could be adversely affected. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, inventory reserves, contingent payments under endorsement contracts, accounting for property, plant and equipment and definite-lived assets, hedge accounting for derivatives, stock-based compensation, income taxes and other contingencies. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock. Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock. There are provisions within our articles of incorporation and Oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, a freeze-out statute, two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company. We may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline. Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts' opinions of our future performance, which may, in part, be based upon any guidance we have provided. Analysts' estimates are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stock price is volatile for any reason, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in reputational damage, substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources needed to successfully run our business. 18 NIKE, INC. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ", "2": " ITEM 2. PROPERTIES The following is a summary of principal properties owned or leased by NIKE: The NIKE World Campus, owned by NIKE and located near Beaverton, Oregon, USA, is an approximately 400-acre site consisting of over 40 buildings which, together with adjacent leased properties, functions as our world headquarters and is occupied by approximately 12,600 employees engaged in management, research, design, development, marketing, finance and other administrative functions serving nearly all of our segments. We lease a similar, but smaller, administrative facility in Hilversum, the Netherlands, which serves as the headquarters for the Europe, Middle East  Africa geography and management of certain brand functions for our non-U.S. operations. We also lease an office complex in Shanghai, China, our headquarters for Greater China, occupied by employees focused on implementing our wholesale, NIKE Direct and merchandising strategies in the region, among other functions. In the United States, NIKE has six significant distribution centers. Four are located in Memphis, Tennessee, two of which are owned and two of which are leased. Two other distribution centers, one located in Indianapolis, Indiana and one located in Dayton, Tennessee, are leased and operated by third-party logistics providers. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California distribution center, which we lease. NIKE has several distribution facilities outside the United States, some of which are leased and operated by third-party logistics providers. The most significant distribution facilities outside the United States are located in Laakdal, Belgium; Taicang, China; Tomisato, Japan and Incheon, Korea, all of which we own. Air Manufacturing Innovation manufactures Air-Sole cushioning components at NIKE-owned facilities and one leased facility located near Beaverton, Oregon and in St. Charles, Missouri.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our NIKE Direct operations), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, must-have products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail. Through the Consumer Direct Offense, we are focusing on our Triple Double strategy, with the objective of doubling the impact of innovation, increasing our speed to market and growing our direct connections with consumers. As a result of the execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2023, on average, per year, are as follows: ##TABLE_START  High single-digit revenue growth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Gross margin expansion of as much as 50 basis points; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Slight selling and administrative expense leverage; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Mid-teens earnings per share growth; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Low-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital. ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2019 was our first full year executing against our new strategy and our results demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to generate revenue growth, while investing in capabilities to fuel our next phase of long-term growth and profitability. We achieved record revenues in fiscal 2019, growing 7% to $39.1 billion. The NIKE Brand, which represents over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues , delivered 8% revenue growth fueled by investments in innovative products and digital platforms. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand revenues grew 11%, driven by growth across all geographies, NIKE Direct and wholesale, nearly all key categories and double-digit growth across footwear and apparel. Within our NIKE Direct business, digital outpaced all other channels, growing at 35% in fiscal 2019. Revenues for Converse increased 1% and 3% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Asia and digital, which was partially offset by declines in the U.S. and Europe. Income before income taxes increased 11% for fiscal 2019, as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. NIKE, Inc. gross margin increased 90 basis points primarily due to higher full-price average selling price (ASP), on a wholesale equivalent basis, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and growth in NIKE Direct. These benefits were partially offset by higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense was higher as a percent of revenues, reflecting investments in data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms and an initial investment in a new enterprise resource planning tool to accelerate our end-to-end digital transformation. Additionally, we prioritized investments in global brand campaigns aimed at deepening our connection with consumers. Diluted earnings per common share reflects a 2% decline in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program. While foreign currency markets remain volatile, in part due to geopolitical dynamics leading to a stronger U.S. Dollar, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above. 24 NIKE, INC. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2018 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on July 25, 2018. USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. Additionally, currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company's performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. However, references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. 2019 FORM 10-K 25 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data) FISCAL 2019 FISCAL 2018 (1) % CHANGE FISCAL 2017 % CHANGE Revenues $ 39,117 $ 36,397 % $ 34,350 % Cost of sales 21,643 20,441 % 19,038 % Gross profit 17,474 15,956 % 15,312 % Gross margin 44.7 % 43.8 %  44.6 % Demand creation expense 3,753 3,577 % 3,341 % Operating overhead expense 8,949 7,934 % 7,222 % Total selling and administrative expense 12,702 11,511 % 10,563 % % of revenues 32.5 % 31.6 %  30.8 % Interest expense (income), net 54   Other (income) expense, net (78 )  (196 )  Income before income taxes 4,801 4,325 % 4,886 % Income tax expense 2,392 % 270 % Effective tax rate 16.1 % 55.3 %  13.2 % NET INCOME $ 4,029 $ 1,933 % $ 4,240 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 2.49 $ 1.17 % $ 2.51 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Fiscal 2018 reflects the impact from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Revenues grew 11% for fiscal 2019 , driven by growth in both the NIKE Brand and Converse. All NIKE Brand geographies delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2019 as our Consumer Direct Offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers through NIKE.com and related mobile applications, digital partner platforms, NIKE-owned and partner stores, as well as through our wholesale customers. Revenue growth was broad-based as Greater China, North America and EMEA each contributed approximately 3 percentage points of growth to NIKE, Inc. Revenues , with APLA contributing approximately 2 percentage points of growth. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 12% and 11% , respectively, for fiscal 2019 , while NIKE Brand equipment revenues grew 4% . On a category basis, the increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues was driven by growth in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear and, to a lesser extent, the Jordan Brand and Running. Unit sales of footwear increased 8% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 4 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs. The currency-neutral increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2019 was fueled by growth in nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear. Unit sales of apparel increased 6% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts, as well as higher NIKE Direct ASP. On a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 32% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2019 compared to 30% for fiscal 2018 . Digital commerce sales were $3.8 billion for fiscal 2019 compared to $2.8 billion for fiscal 2018 . On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 16% for fiscal 2019 , driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 35%, comparable store sales growth of 6% and the addition of new stores. Comparable store sales, which exclude digital commerce sales, comprises revenue from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. On a wholesale equivalent and currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2019 NIKE Brand Men's and Women's revenues increased 10% and 11% , respectively, both driven by growth in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear. During fiscal 2019, the growth in Women's was fueled by our focus on compelling design, creating female-focused brand campaigns globally and a shift towards digital-led distribution. Revenues for our NIKE Kids' business increased 11% , as all key categories, except Football (Soccer), experienced growth. 28 NIKE, INC. GROSS MARGIN FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 For fiscal 2019 , our consolidated gross profit increased 10% to $17,474 million compared to $15,956 million for fiscal 2018 . Gross margin increased 90 basis points to 44.7% for fiscal 2019 compared to 43.8% for fiscal 2018 due to the following: ##TABLE_START *Wholesale equivalent ##TABLE_ENDHigher NIKE Brand product costs are primarily due to shifts in mix to higher-cost products and an increase in labor rates compared to fiscal 2018. Additionally, gross margin was favorably impacted by growth in our higher-margin NIKE Direct business.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased Demand creation expense by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2019 . Operating overhead expense increased 13% for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 , driven primarily by higher wage-related and administrative expenses, which reflect critical investments in innovation, data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms and an initial investment in a new enterprise resource planning tool to accelerate our end-to-end digital transformation. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased Operating overhead expense by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2019 . OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET ##TABLE_START (Dollars In millions)  FISCAL 2019  FISCAL 2018  FISCAL 2017 Other (income) expense, net  $ (78 )  $  $ (196 ) ##TABLE_ENDOther (income) expense, net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business. FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2018  Other (income) expense, net changed from $66 million of other expense, net for fiscal 2018 to $78 million of other income, net for fiscal 2019 , primarily due to a $136 million net beneficial change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $97 million for fiscal 2019 . 2019 FORM 10-K 29 INCOME TAXES ##TABLE_START  FISCAL 2019 FISCAL 2018 % CHANGE FISCAL 2017 % CHANGE Effective tax rate 16.1 % 55.3 % (3,920) bps 13.2 % 4,210 bps ##TABLE_ENDFISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2018  Our effective tax rate was 16.1% for fiscal 2019 , compared to 55.3% for fiscal 2018 due to significant changes related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) in the prior year and a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory rate to 21% in the current year. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in U.S. tax on foreign earnings due to the impact of global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impact of the Tax Act. OPERATING SEGMENTS Our operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East  Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific  Latin America (APLA), and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Company's NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable operating segment for the Company, and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency exchange rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established.

Consumers are demanding a constant flow of fresh and innovative product, and have an expectation for superior service and rapid delivery, all fueled by the shift toward digital and mono-brand experiences in NIKE Direct. Specifically, in North America we anticipate continued evolution within the retail landscape, driven by shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels. The evolution of the North America marketplace is resulting in third-party retail store closures; however, we are currently seeing stabilization and momentum building with our strategic wholesale customers, fueled by innovative product and NIKE Brand consumer experiences, leveraging digital. FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 On a currency-neutral basis, North America revenues increased 7% , driven by growth in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear. NIKE Direct revenues increased 7% for fiscal 2019 as strong digital commerce sales growth of 29% and the addition of new stores more than offset a 3% decline in comparable store sales. The decline in comparable store sales was primarily due to higher sales in NIKE Brand in-line stores being more than offset by declines in NIKE Brand Factory Stores (\"NFS\"), as growth in our full-price channel has impacted the availability and composition of off-price inventory for sale within NFS. 2019 FORM 10-K 31 Footwear revenues increased 8% on a currency-neutral basis for fiscal 2019 , driven by growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear. Unit sales of footwear increased 4%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 4 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts, as well as higher ASP in our NIKE Direct business. On a currency-neutral basis, apparel revenues increased 7% for fiscal 2019 , driven by higher revenues in all key categories, led by Sportswear, followed by NIKE Basketball. Unit sales of apparel increased 5%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in ASP per unit was primarily a result of higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts. Reported EBIT increased 9% for fiscal 2019 , reflecting higher revenues, gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 30 basis points as higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts, as well as favorable full-price mix more than offset higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expenses. The increase in demand creation expense was primarily due to higher advertising and marketing costs. Operating overhead expense increased as a result of higher wage-related costs, including investments in our NIKE Direct operations.

Unit sales of footwear increased 9% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 3 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair primarily resulted from higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs. For fiscal 2019 , currency-neutral apparel revenues increased 9% due to growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear. Unit sales of apparel increased 6% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP per unit was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs. Reported EBIT increased 26% for fiscal 2019 , primarily due to strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 280 basis points as favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher full-price ASP more than offset higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense. Growth in operating overhead expense was primarily due to higher wage-related and administrative costs, including investments in our NIKE Direct operations. The increase in demand creation expense was primarily driven by higher advertising and marketing expenses, as well as higher sports marketing costs. The growth in demand creation and operating overhead expense was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, specifically the Euro. 32 NIKE, INC.

Revenues increased in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear and Running. NIKE Direct revenues increased 23% , fueled by strong digital commerce sales growth of 61%, comparable store sales growth of 14% and the addition of new stores. The 12% increase in currency-neutral footwear revenues for fiscal 2019 was attributable to growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear, followed by Running. Unit sales of footwear increased 6% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 6 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory. Currency-neutral apparel revenues grew 15% for fiscal 2019 , driven by higher revenues in nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear, followed by Training. Unit sales of apparel increased 7% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 8 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily driven by higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory.

In territories we define as direct distribution markets, Converse designs, markets and sells products directly to distributors, wholesale customers and to consumers through direct to consumer operations. The largest direct distribution markets are the United States, the United Kingdom and China. We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan. Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalty revenues to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights. FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 On a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues increased 3% for fiscal 2019 . Comparable direct distribution markets (i.e., markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years) increased 2%, which drove the majority of total Converse revenue growth. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales decreased 3% for fiscal 2019 , while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenue growth. On a territory basis, the increase in comparable direct distribution markets revenues for the year was primarily attributable to revenue growth in Asia across all distribution channels, partially offset by lower revenues in the U.S. and Europe. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution had minimal impact on total Converse revenues for fiscal 2019 . Revenues from comparable licensed markets grew 6% for fiscal 2019 , primarily due to revenue growth in Asia and Brazil, but had minimal impact on total Converse revenue growth. Reported EBIT for Converse decreased 2% for fiscal 2019 as higher selling and administrative expense more than offset gross margin expansion and revenue growth. Gross margin increased 180 basis points, driven by higher margin in our direct to consumer business, favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher full-price ASP due to changes in product mix. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead and higher demand creation expense. Higher operating overhead expense was due to an increase in wage-related and administrative costs, primarily to support investments in our digital business. Higher demand creation expense was primarily due to an increase in advertising and marketing costs associated with our digital platform.

Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (NTC) and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements and Note 14  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded, as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end. TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: ##TABLE_START  Product Costs  NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. ##TABLE_END In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost. ##TABLE_START 2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. ##TABLE_END For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within  Inventories  and is recognized in  Cost of sales  when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through  Other (income) expense, net . Refer to  Note 14  Risk Management and Derivatives  in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost. 36 NIKE, INC. ##TABLE_START  Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales  A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Costs  Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net . Refer to Note 14  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities  Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations. ##TABLE_END MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries' non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders' equity . In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $1,236 million, a benefit of approximately $832 million and a detriment of approximately $542 million for the years ended May 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $233 million, a benefit of approximately $177 million and a detriment of approximately $115 million for the years ended May 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Management has concluded our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment is operating in a hyper-inflationary market. As a result, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the U.S. Dollar. As of and for the period ended May 31, 2019, this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates. MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of the purchase of U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. 2019 FORM 10-K 37 We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $97 million, $110 million and $59 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2019 and 2018. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW ACTIVITY Cash provided by operations was $5,903 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $4,955 million for fiscal 2018 . Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $5,341 million of operating cash flow for fiscal 2019 compared to $3,473 million for fiscal 2018 . The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase to Cash provided by operations of $562 million for fiscal 2019 , compared to an increase to Cash provided by operations of $1,482 million for fiscal 2018 . The primary driver of the change in working capital relates to the accrual of $1,172 million for the transition tax under the Tax Act during fiscal 2018. Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes for additional information on the Tax Act. Cash provided by operations in fiscal 2019 was further impacted by the net change in cash collateral with derivative counterparties as a result of hedging transactions. During fiscal 2019 , we received cash collateral of $266 million compared to $23 million in fiscal 2018 . In addition, the change in Accounts receivable, net , decreased Cash provided by operations by $457 million in fiscal 2019 , primarily driven by revenue growth. Cash provided (used) by investing activities was an outflow of $264 million for fiscal 2019 , compared to an inflow of $276 million for fiscal 2018 , driven primarily by the net change in short-term investments. During fiscal 2019 , the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash inflow of $850 million compared to an inflow of $1,326 million in fiscal 2018 . In fiscal 2020, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, including corporate facilities, expanding our digital capabilities and new NIKE Direct stores. We continue to expect such investments to approximate 3% to 4% of revenues, on average. Cash used by financing activities was $5,293 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $4,835 million for fiscal 2018 with the increase primarily impacted by the repayment of Notes payable during fiscal 2019 . In fiscal 2019 , we purchased 54.3 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $4,283 million (an average price of $ 78.86 per share). During the third quarter of fiscal 2019 , we concluded the four-year, $12 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2015. Throughout this program we purchased a total of 192.1 million shares for $12 billion (an average price of $62.47 per share). Immediately following the completion of this program, we began repurchasing shares under the new four-year, $15 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in June 2018. As of May 31, 2019, we had repurchased 11.6 million shares at a cost of $986 million (an average price of $84.72 per share) under this new program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceeds from debt. The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. CAPITAL RESOURCES On July 21, 2016, we filed a shelf registration statement (the Shelf) with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expired on July 21, 2019 and we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the SEC in July 2019. For additional information regarding our long-term debt refer to Note 8  Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 38 NIKE, INC. On August 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one-year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. As of and for the periods ended May 31, 2019 and 2018 , we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility. We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2019 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our $2 billion commercial paper program. On June 1, 2018, we repaid $325 million and had no additional borrowings under this program as of and for the year ended May 31, 2019. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. To date, in fiscal 2019, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs; however, future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. As of May 31, 2019 , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $4.7 billion , primarily consisting of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2019 , the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 32 days. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2019 , and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows: ##TABLE_START DESCRIPTION OF COMMITMENT CASH PAYMENTS DUE DURING THE YEAR ENDING MAY 31, (Dollars in millions) 2021 2023 THEREAFTER TOTAL Operating Leases $ $ $ $ $ $ 1,494 $ 3,732 Capital Leases and Other Financing Obligations (1) 34 37 197 Long-Term Debt (2) 112 609 4,617 5,660 Endorsement Contracts (3) 1,382 1,274 1,360 1,077 4,148 10,209 Product Purchase Obligations (4) 5,203      5,203 Other Purchase Obligations (5) 1,331 225 135 2,760 Transition Tax Related to the Tax Act (6) 86 86 483 TOTAL $ 8,702 $ 2,430 $ 2,261 $ 2,361 $ 1,741 $ 11,431 $ 28,926 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Capital leases and other financing obligations include payments related to build-to-suit lease arrangements. ##TABLE_END2019 FORM 10-K 39 ##TABLE_START (2) The cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2019 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. ##TABLE_END In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. ##TABLE_START (4) We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our NIKE Direct in-line stores and digital commerce operations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) Other purchase obligations primarily include construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit  Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. 40 NIKE, INC. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements as of a given date. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. REVENUE RECOGNITION On June 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting policies. Our revenue recognition polices under Topic 606 are described in the following paragraphs and references to prior period policies under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 605  Revenue Recognition, are included below in the event they are substantially different. Revenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. We satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control has passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product. Transfer of control passes to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control passes to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. Prior to June 1, 2018, the requirements for recognizing revenue were met upon delivery to the customer. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions. As part of our revenue recognition policy, consideration promised in our contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. We estimate the most likely amount we will be entitled to receive and record an anticipated reduction against Revenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Prior to June 1, 2018, the Company's reserve balances were reported net of the estimated cost of inventory for product returns and recognized within Accounts receivable, ne t for wholesale transactions and Accrued liabilities for our direct to consumer business, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date. Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims were significantly different than reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made. Refer also to Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16  Revenues for additional information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. INVENTORY RESERVES We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales . If changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination. 2019 FORM 10-K 41 CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS A significant amount of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser's performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products, which we record in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments, we record the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense . PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group's carrying amount and its estimated fair value. HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES We use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) , rather than Net income , until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income . In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. INCOME TAXES We are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. On an interim basis, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense . The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. 42 NIKE, INC. We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense . On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Act, which significantly changed previous U.S. tax laws, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, among other changes. The Tax Act also transitions U.S. international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings, which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. taxation. Certain provisions of the Tax Act, including a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of foreign subsidiaries, were not effective for the Company until fiscal 2019. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company has made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense. Implementation of the Tax Act required us to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018, which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018. We completed our analysis of the Tax Act in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and no adjustments were made to the provisional amounts recorded. Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. OTHER CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  2019 FORM 10-K 43 ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2019 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 14  Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities. MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (VaR). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $34 million and $93 million at May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The VAR decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2019. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $83 million and $260 million during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. 44 NIKE, INC. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows. Details of third-party debt are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. ##TABLE_START  EXPECTED MATURITY DATE YEAR ENDING MAY 31, (Dollars in millions) 2021 2023 THEREAFTER TOTAL FAIR VALUE Foreign Exchange Risk         Japanese Yen Functional Currency         Long-term Japanese Yen debt  Fixed rate         Principal payments $ $ $  $  $  $  $ $ Average interest rate 2.4 % 2.4 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 2.4 %  Interest Rate Risk         Japanese Yen Functional Currency         Long-term Japanese Yen debt  Fixed rate         Principal payments $ $ $  $  $  $  $ $ Average interest rate 2.4 % 2.4 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 2.4 %  U.S. Dollar Functional Currency         Long-term U.S. Dollar debt  Fixed rate         Principal payments $  $  $  $ $  $ 3,000 $ 3,500 $ 3,515 Average interest rate 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 2.3 % 0.0 % 3.3 % 3.1 %  ##TABLE_ENDThe fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Management of NIKE, Inc. is responsible for the information and representations contained in this report. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and include certain amounts based on our best estimates and judgments. Other financial information in this report is consistent with these financial statements. Our accounting systems include controls designed to reasonably assure assets are safeguarded from unauthorized use or disposition and provide for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These systems are supplemented by the selection and training of qualified financial personnel and an organizational structure providing for appropriate segregation of duties. An internal corporate audit department reviews the results of its work with the Audit  Finance Committee of the Board of Directors, presently comprised of three outside, independent directors. The Audit  Finance Committee is responsible for the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews, with the independent registered public accounting firm, management and the internal corporate audit staff, the scope and the results of the annual audit, the effectiveness of the accounting control system and other matters relating to the financial affairs of NIKE as the Audit  Finance Committee deems appropriate. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal corporate auditors have full access to the Audit  Finance Committee, with and without the presence of management, to discuss any appropriate matters. 46 NIKE, INC. MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(f) and Rule 15(d) - 15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2019 . PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited (1) the Consolidated Financial Statements and (2) the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2019 , as stated in their report herein. ##TABLE_START Mark G. Parker Andrew Campion Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer ##TABLE_END2019 FORM 10-K 47 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NIKE, Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of May 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2019, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principles As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for revenue from contracts with customers and the manner in which it accounts for income taxes related to intra-entity transfers other than inventory as of June 1, 2018 and the manner in which it accounts for share-based payment awards to employees as of June 1, 2017. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 48 NIKE, INC.

NIKE, Inc. portfolio brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse. The NIKE Brand is focused on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services across a wide range of sport categories, amplified with sport-inspired sportswear products carrying the Swoosh trademark, as well as other NIKE Brand trademarks. The Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. The Hurley brand is focused on action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the Hurley trademark. Sales and operating results of Hurley brand products are reported within the NIKE Brand's North America geographic operating segment. Converse designs, distributes, licenses and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\" or \"NIKE\"). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. REVENUE RECOGNITION Beginning in fiscal 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . Prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company's historical accounting policies. The Company's revenue recognition polices under Topic 606 are described in the following paragraphs and references to prior period policies under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 605  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) , are included below in the event they are substantially different. Revenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control has passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product. Transfer of control passes to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control passes to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. Prior to June 1, 2018, the requirements for recognizing revenue were met upon delivery to the customer. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions. Consideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangements and the associated revenues are recognized over the license period. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenue is recognized. 56 NIKE, INC. SALES-RELATED RESERVES Consideration promised in the Company's contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. The Company estimates the most likely amount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against Revenues , with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Prior to June 1, 2018, the Company's reserve balances were reported net of the estimated cost of inventory for product returns and recognized within Accounts receivable, net for wholesale transactions and Accrued liabilities for the Company's direct to consumer business, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date. Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected, but not yet finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made. COST OF SALES Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and product design costs. Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales . DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary product, television, digital and print advertising and media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run. Advertising media costs are expensed when the advertisement appears. Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is complete and delivered. A significant amount of the Company's promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sport (e.g., winning a championship). The Company records Demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When the Company determines payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the Company's best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from the Company's estimate due to changes in the endorser's performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products, which the Company records in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments, the Company records the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense . Through cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses its wholesale customers for certain costs of advertising the Company's products. The Company records these costs in Demand creation expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs. This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run. 2019 FORM 10-K 57 Total advertising and promotion expenses, which the Company refers to as Demand creation expense , were $3,753 million , $3,577 million and $3,341 million for the years ended May 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses totaled $773 million and $730 million at May 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, of which $333 million and $359 million , respectively, was recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets , and $440 million and $371 million , respectively, was recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets , depending on the period to which the prepayment applied. OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE Operating overhead expense consists primarily of wage and benefit-related expenses, research and development costs, as well as other administrative expenses, such as rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services, meetings and travel. CASH AND EQUIVALENTS Cash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, money market funds, time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS Short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, time deposits and corporate debt securities, with maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase. Debt securities the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At May 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company did not hold any short-term investments classified as trading or held-to-maturity. At May 31, 2019 and 2018 , Short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale debt securities, which are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) , unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale debt securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and, therefore, classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at the date of purchase as current assets within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Company's short-term investments. ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Accounts receivable, net consist primarily of amounts receivable from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets . The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $30 million at both May 31, 2019 and 2018 . INVENTORY VALUATION Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value, and valued on either an average or a specific identification cost basis. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer, with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis. Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Company's suppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance and logistics and other handling fees. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for land improvements, buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years. Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales . Depreciation and amortization of all other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense . 58 NIKE, INC. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS Internal Use Software : Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 12 -year period on a straight-line basis. The Company's policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed : Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group's carrying amount and its estimated fair value. GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, an impairment test is unnecessary. If an impairment test is necessary, the Company will estimate the fair value of its related reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is determined to be impaired and the Company will proceed with recording an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, the Company primarily utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes trade names and trademarks have value to the extent their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible exceeds its fair value, the asset is determined to be impaired and the Company will proceed with recording an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value. 2019 FORM 10-K 59 OPERATING LEASES The Company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space, equipment and other non-real estate assets under operating leases. Operating lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. Rent expense for non-cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, beginning with the effective lease commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Certain leases also provide for contingent rent, which is generally determined as a percent of sales in excess of specified levels. A contingent rent liability is recognized together with the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, equity securities and available-for-sale debt securities. Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach). The levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: ##TABLE_START  Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3: Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. ##TABLE_END The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Pricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and its counterparties. The Company's fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. Refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements for additional information. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Total shareholders' equity . The Company's global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, the impact of which is recorded in Other (income) expense, net , within the Consolidated Statements of Income. ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (a component of Total shareholders' equity ), Long-term debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the 60 NIKE, INC. Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For designated net investment hedges, this is within the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the Company's fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Refer to Note 14  Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Company's risk management program and derivatives. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company accounts for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, of equity awards and recognizing the related expense as Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense , as applicable, in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Substantially all awards vest ratably over four years of continued employment, with stock options expiring ten years from the date of grant. The fair value of options, stock appreciation rights, and employees' purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs) is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is established by the market price on the date of grant. Refer to Note 11  Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for additional information on the Company's stock-based compensation programs. INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense . Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes for further discussion. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards. Refer to Note 12  Earnings Per Share for further discussion. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Topic 606, which replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. The new standard requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, Topic 606 requires disclosures of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company adopted this standard using a modified retrospective approach in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized in Retained earnings at June 1, 2018. Comparative prior period information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported in accordance with previous revenue recognition guidance in Topic 605. The Company has applied the new standard to all contracts at adoption. 2019 FORM 10-K 61 The Company's adoption of Topic 606 resulted in a change to the timing of revenue recognition. The satisfaction of the Company's performance obligation is based upon transfer of control over a product to a customer, which results in sales being recognized upon shipment rather than upon delivery for certain wholesale transactions and substantially all digital commerce sales. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product. This resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment, which increased Retained earnings by $23 million at June 1, 2018. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material effect on the Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2019. Additionally, the Company's reserve balances for returns, post-invoice sales discounts and miscellaneous claims for wholesale transactions were previously reported net of the estimated cost of inventory for product returns, and as a reduction to Accounts receivable, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under Topic 606, an asset for the estimated cost of inventory for expected products returns is now recognized separately from the liability for sales-related reserves. This resulted in an increase to Accounts receivable, net , an increase in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and an increase in Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2019 . Sales-related reserves for the Company's direct to consumer operations continue to be recognized in Accrued liabilities , but are now recorded separately from an asset for the estimated cost of inventory for expected product returns, which is recognized in Prepaid expenses and other current assets . The following table presents the related effect of the adoption of Topic 606 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2019 : ##TABLE_START  AS OF MAY 31, 2019 (Dollars in millions) AS REPORTED EFFECT OF ADOPTION BALANCES WITHOUT ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606 Accounts receivable, net $ 4,272 $ $ 3,490 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 1,968 1,558 Total current assets 16,525 1,192 15,333 TOTAL ASSETS 23,717 1,192 22,525 Accrued liabilities 5,010 1,192 3,818 Total current liabilities 7,866 1,192 6,674 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY $ 23,717 $ 1,192 $ 22,525 ##TABLE_ENDOther impacts from the adoption of Topic 606 on the Consolidated Financial Statements were immaterial. Refer to Note 16  Revenues for further discussion. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement  Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) . The standard allows for reclassification of stranded tax effects on items resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Retained earnings . Tax effects unrelated to the Tax Act are released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) using either the specific identification approach or the portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item. The Company early adopted the ASU in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. As a result of the adoption, Retained earnings decreased by $17 million , with a corresponding increase to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) due to the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Refer to Note 9  Income Taxes for additional information on the impact of the Tax Act. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees. The Company adopted the ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The updated guidance requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies from share-based payment awards to be recorded in income tax expense in the income statement. Previously, excess tax benefits and deficiencies were recognized in shareholders' equity on the balance sheet. This change is required to be applied prospectively. During fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, the Company recognized $175 million and $230 million , respectively, of excess tax benefits related to share-based payment awards in Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory . The updated guidance requires companies to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of inventory will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The Company adopted the standard on June 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach, with the cumulative effect of applying the new standard recognized in Retained earnings at the date of adoption. The adoption resulted in reductions to Retained earnings, Deferred income taxes and other assets , and Prepaid expenses and other current assets of $507 million , $422 million and $45 million , respectively, and an increase in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities of $40 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 62 NIKE, INC. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , which expands and refines hedge accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedge items in the financial statements, and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The Company elected to early adopt the ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplified the accounting for goodwill impairment by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill in measuring an impairment charge, previously Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Under the new standard, an impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, previously Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. The guidance still allows companies to perform the optional qualitative assessment before determining whether to proceed to Step 1. The Company adopted the ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments  Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . The updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The Company adopted the ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which replaces existing lease accounting guidance. The new standard is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use (ROU) assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The new guidance will require the Company to continue to classify leases as either an operating or finance lease, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. In addition, the new standard requires enhanced disclosure surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing agreements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, which provides entities with an additional transition method to adopt Topic 842. Under the new transition method, an entity initially applies the new standard at the adoption date, versus at the beginning of the earliest period presented, and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. The Company will elect this transition method at the adoption date of June 1, 2019. Upon adoption, the Company will elect the package of transition practical expedients which would allow the Company to carry forward prior conclusions related to: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (ii) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (iii) initial direct costs for existing leases. Additionally, the Company will elect the practical expedient to not separate lease components from nonlease components for all real estate leases within the portfolio. The Company will make an accounting policy election to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off the Consolidated Balance Sheets and will recognize related lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In preparation for implementation, the Company has been executing changes to business processes, including implementing a software solution to assist with the new reporting requirements. Upon adoption, the Company's total assets and total liabilities will increase by approximately $2.8 billion . The Company does not believe the standard will have a material impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 2019 FORM 10-K 63 ##TABLE_START NOTE 2  INVENTORIES ##TABLE_ENDInventory balances of $5,622 million and $5,261 million at May 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, were substantially all finished goods. ##TABLE_START NOTE 3  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ##TABLE_ENDProperty, plant and equipment, net included the following: ##TABLE_START  AS OF MAY 31, (Dollars in millions) 2018 Land and improvements $ $ Buildings 2,445 2,195 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software 4,335 4,230 Leasehold improvements 1,563 1,494 Construction in process 641 Total property, plant and equipment, gross 9,469 8,891 Less accumulated depreciation 4,725 4,437 TOTAL PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET $ 4,744 $ 4,454 ##TABLE_ENDCapitalized interest was not material for the years ended May 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . ##TABLE_START NOTE 4  IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL ##TABLE_ENDIdentifiable intangible assets, net consist of indefinite-lived trademarks, acquired trademarks and other intangible assets.

The Company purchases through Sojitz America certain NIKE Brand products it acquires from non-U.S. suppliers. These purchases are for products sold in certain countries in the Company's Asia Pacific  Latin America geographic operating segment and Canada, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Accounts payable to Sojitz America are generally due up to 60 days after shipment of goods from the foreign port. The interest rate on such accounts payable is the 60 -day London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as of the beginning of the month of the invoice date, plus 0.75% . As of May 31, 2019 , no borrowings were outstanding under the Company's $2 billion commercial paper program. As of May 31, 2018, the Company had $325 million outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 1.77% . On August 28, 2015, the Company entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one -year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. Based on the Company's current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.455% . The facility fee is 0.045% of the total commitment. Under the committed credit facility, the Company must maintain certain financial ratios, among other things, with which the Company was in compliance at May 31, 2019 .

For fiscal 2018, the change in the corporate tax rate resulted in a blended U.S. federal statutory rate for the Company of approximately 29% . Certain provisions of the Tax Act, including a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of foreign subsidiaries, were not effective for the Company until fiscal 2019. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company has made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense. Implementation of the Tax Act required the Company to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018, which increased its effective tax rate in fiscal 2018. The Company completed its analysis of the Tax Act in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and no adjustments were made to the provisional amounts recorded. As of May 31, 2019 and 2018 , long-term income taxes payable were $902 million and $993 million , respectively, and were included within Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows: ##TABLE_START  YEAR ENDED MAY 31,  2018 Federal income tax rate 21.0 % 29.2 % 35.0 % State taxes, net of federal benefit 1.2 % 1.2 % 1.1 % Foreign earnings -2.1 % -17.5 % -20.7 % Transition tax related to the Tax Act  % 43.3 %  % Remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the Tax Act  % 3.7 %  % Excess tax benefits from share-based compensation -3.6 % -5.3 %  % Resolution of a U.S. tax matter  %  % -3.2 % U.S. Research and Development tax credit -1.1 % -0.6 % -0.6 % Other, net 0.7 % 1.3 % 1.6 % EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE 16.1 % 55.3 % 13.2 % ##TABLE_END2019 FORM 10-K 69 The effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2019 was lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2018 due to significant changes related to the enactment of the Tax Act in the prior year and reduction in the U.S. federal statutory rate to 21% in the current year. The foreign earnings rate impact shown above for the year ended May 31, 2019 includes 1.5% of U.S. tax on foreign earnings driven by the impact of the Tax Act. The effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2018 was higher than the effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2017 primarily due to the enactment of the Tax Act, which included provisional expense of $1,875 million for the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, and $158 million due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The remaining provisions of the Tax Act, which were a net benefit to the effective tax rate, did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements during fiscal 2018. Additionally, the increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the tax benefit from share-based compensation in the current period as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. During the year ended May 31, 2017, income tax benefit of $177 million attributable to employee share-based compensation were allocated to Total shareholders' equity . As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, beginning in fiscal 2018, income tax benefits from share-based compensation are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The majority of the total gross unrecognized tax benefits are long-term in nature and included within Deferred income taxes and other liabilities  on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 70 NIKE, INC. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The liability for payment of interest and penalties increased by $17 million during the year ended May 31, 2019 , decreased by $14 million during the year ended May 31, 2018 and decreased by $38 million during the year ended May 31, 2017 . As of May 31, 2019 and 2018 , accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $174 million and $157 million , respectively (excluding federal benefit). The Company is subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has closed all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2016 , with the exception of certain transfer pricing adjustments. The Company's major foreign jurisdictions, China and the Netherlands, have concluded substantially all income tax matters through calendar 2008 and fiscal 2012, respectively. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in the aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $210 million within the next 12 months. In January 2019, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company. The Company believes the investigation is without merit. If this matter is adversely resolved, the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods, and the company's Netherlands income taxes in the future could increase. The Company historically provided for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they were considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, in fiscal 2018 the Company reevaluated its historic indefinite reinvestment assertion and determined that any historical or future undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested. A portion of the Company's foreign operations benefit from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2021 . This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The tax benefit attributable to this tax holiday was $167 million , $126 million and $187 million for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on diluted earnings per common share was $0.10 , $0.08 and $0.11 for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Deferred tax assets at May 31, 2019 and 2018 were reduced by a valuation allowance primarily relating to tax benefits of certain entities with operating losses. There was a $7 million net decrease in the valuation allowance for the year ended May 31, 2019 , compared to a $13 million net increase for the year ended May 31, 2018 , and $30 million net increase for the year ended May 31, 2017 . The Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of $257 million at May 31, 2019 .

Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors. There are no differences in the dividend and liquidation preferences or participation rights of the holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock. From time to time, the Company's Board of Directors authorizes share repurchase programs for the repurchase of Class B Common Stock. The value of repurchased shares is deducted from Total shareholders' equity through allocation to Capital in excess  of stated value and Retained earnings . STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the Stock Incentive Plan) provides for the issuance of up to 718 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with equity awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. The Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance-based awards. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the Stock Incentive Plan. The committee has the authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards and the other terms and conditions of the awards. The Company generally grants stock options and restricted stock on an annual basis. Substantially all awards under the Stock Incentive Plan vest ratably over 4 years of continued employment, with stock options expiring 10 years from the date of grant.

Accelerated stock option expense is recorded for employees meeting certain retirement eligibility requirements. Accelerated stock option expense was $41 million , $18 million and $14 million for the years ended May 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. ##TABLE_END The income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $175 million and $230 million for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and reported within Income tax expense in accordance with ASU 2016-09. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense were $177 million and allocated to Total shareholders' equity . STOCK OPTIONS The weighted average fair value per share of the options granted during the years ended May 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , computed as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model, was $22.78 , $9.82 and $9.38 , respectively.

The Company estimates the expected volatility based on the implied volatility in market traded options on the Company's common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. The weighted average expected life of options is based on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns. The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rate in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the options.

The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended May 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $938 million , $889 million and $594 million , respectively. The intrinsic value is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the options. The weighted average contractual life remaining for options outstanding and options exercisable at May 31, 2019 was 5.9 years and 4.3 years, respectively. As of May 31, 2019 , the Company had $352 million of unrecognized compensation costs from stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, to be recognized in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense , as applicable, over a weighted average remaining period of 2.1 years. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS In addition to the Stock Incentive Plan, the Company gives employees the right to purchase shares at a discount from the market price under employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs). Subject to the annual statutory limit, employees are eligible to participate through payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation. At the end of each six -month offering period, shares are purchased by the participants at 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or the end of the offering period. Employees purchased 2.5 million , 3.1 million and 3.1 million shares during each of the fiscal years ended May 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS Recipients of restricted stock are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respective shares throughout the period of restriction. Recipients of restricted stock units are entitled to dividend equivalent cash payments upon vesting.

The Company allows certain highly compensated employees and non-employee directors of the Company to defer compensation under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Deferred compensation plan liabilities were $647 million and $641 million at May 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and primarily classified as non-current in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has pension plans in various countries worldwide. The pension plans are only available to local employees and are generally government mandated. The liability related to the unfunded pension liabilities of the plans was $73 million and $70 million at May 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and primarily classified as non-current in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 74 NIKE, INC. ##TABLE_START NOTE 14  RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES ##TABLE_ENDThe Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions and assessing, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of the hedging relationships. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2019 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based on the instrument's maturity date. The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2019 and 2018 .

In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will account for the derivative as an undesignated instrument as discussed below. The purpose of the Company's foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency exposures the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external and intercompany revenues, demand creation expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions. 76 NIKE, INC. Product cost exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below. NIKE entities primarily purchase product in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a wholly owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the product to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency result in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. The Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the Company's existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, the Company's payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order. Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below. The Company's policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $8.1 billion as of May 31, 2019 . As of May 31, 2019 , approximately $518 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income . Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2019 , the maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 15 months. FAIR VALUE HEDGES The Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method requirements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. The Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31, 2019 . NET INVESTMENT HEDGES The Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2019 . UNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/or the embedded derivative contracts. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net , together with the re-measurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position and/or embedded derivative contract. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $6.5 billion as of May 31, 2019 . 2019 FORM 10-K 77 EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES As part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. In addition, embedded derivative contracts are created when the Company enters into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts. Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net , through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist. At May 31, 2019 , the total notional amount of embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $452 million . CREDIT RISK The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings; however, this does not eliminate the Company's exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored. The Company's derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties' creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Company's bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require the owing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50 million should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than $50 million . Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also trigger collateral requirements. As of May 31, 2019 , the Company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features and derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position were immaterial. Accordingly, the Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features. Further, as of May 31, 2019 , the Company had $289 million of cash collateral received from various counterparties to its derivative contracts (refer to Note 6  Fair Value Measurements ). The Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial . ##TABLE_START NOTE 15  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) ##TABLE_ENDThe changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) , net of tax, were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT (1) CASH FLOW HEDGES NET INVESTMENT HEDGES (1) OTHER TOTAL Balance at May 31, 2018 $ (173 ) $ $ $ (51 ) $ (92 ) Other comprehensive income (loss):      Other comprehensive gains (losses) before reclassifications (2) (173 )  410 Reclassifications to net income of previously deferred (gains) losses (3)  (70 )  (17 ) (87 ) Total other comprehensive income (loss) (173 )  (7 ) Balance at May 31, 2019 $ (346 ) $ $ $ (58 ) $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment and net investment hedge gains/losses related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary are reclassified to Net income upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the respective entity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Net of tax benefit (expense) of $ 0 million , $ (4) million , $ 0 million , $ 1 million and $ (3) million , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Net of tax (benefit) expense of $ 0 million , $ 6 million , $ 0 million , $ 0 million and $ 6 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END78 NIKE, INC. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT (1) CASH FLOW HEDGES NET INVESTMENT HEDGES (1) OTHER TOTAL Balance at May 31, 2017 $ (191 ) $ (52 ) $ $ (85 ) $ (213 ) Other comprehensive income (loss):      Other comprehensive gains (losses) before reclassifications (2) (6 ) (52 )  (56 ) Reclassifications to net income of previously deferred (gains) losses (3)   160 Total other comprehensive income (loss) (6 )  104 Reclassifications to retained earnings in accordance with ASU 2018-02 (4) (7 )   Balance at May 31, 2018 $ (173 ) $ $ $ (51 ) $ (92 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment and net investment hedge gains/losses related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary are reclassified to Net income upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the respective entity. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Net of tax benefit (expense) of $ (24) million , $ (3) million , $ 0 million , $ (4) million and $ (31) million , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Net of tax (benefit) expense of $ 0 million , $ (3) million , $ 0 million , $ 0 million and $ (3) million , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Refer to Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on the adoption of ASU 2018-02 during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the reclassifications from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the Consolidated Statements of Income: ##TABLE_START  AMOUNT OF GAIN (LOSS) RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) INTO INCOME LOCATION OF GAIN (LOSS) RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) INTO INCOME  YEAR ENDED MAY 31, (Dollars in millions) 2018 Gains (losses) on cash flow hedges:    Foreign exchange forwards and options $ (5 ) $ Revenues Foreign exchange forwards and options (90 ) Cost of sales Foreign exchange forwards and options  Demand creation expense Foreign exchange forwards and options (69 ) Other (income) expense, net Interest rate swaps (7 ) (7 ) Interest expense (income), net Total before tax (131 )  Tax (expense) benefit (6 )  Gain (loss) net of tax (128 )  Gains (losses) on other (32 ) Other (income) expense, net Total before tax (32 )  Tax (expense) benefit    Gain (loss) net of tax (32 )  Total net gain (loss) reclassified for the period $ $ (160 )  ##TABLE_END2019 FORM 10-K 79 ##TABLE_START NOTE 16  REVENUES ##TABLE_ENDDISAGGREGATION OF REVENUES The following tables present the Company's revenues disaggregated by reportable operating segment, major product line and by distribution channel: ##TABLE_START  YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2019 (Dollars in millions) NORTH AMERICA EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST  AFRICA GREATER CHINA ASIA PACIFIC  LATIN AMERICA GLOBAL BRAND DIVISIONS TOTAL NIKE BRAND CONVERSE CORPORATE TOTAL NIKE, INC.

SALES-RELATED RESERVES At May 31, 2019 , the Company's sales-related reserve balance, which includes returns, post-invoice sales discounts and miscellaneous claims, was $1,218 million and recorded in Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimated cost of inventory for expected product returns was $410 million as of May 31, 2019 and was recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At May 31, 2018 , the Company's sales-related reserve balance, which includes returns, post-invoice sales discounts and miscellaneous claims, was $675 million , net of the estimated cost of expected product returns, and recognized as a reduction in Accounts receivable, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East  Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific  Latin America, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Company's NIKE Direct operations are managed within each NIKE Brand geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company, and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Global Brand Divisions is included within the NIKE Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. Global Brand Divisions primarily represent NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment, and demand creation and operating overhead expense, including product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand, as well as costs associated with NIKE Direct global digital operations and enterprise technology. Corporate consists primarily of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to the Company's headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses. The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (commonly referred to as EBIT), which represents Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity's functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses. Accounts receivable, net, Inventories and Property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below.

In connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the Company's historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the Company's financial position or results of operations. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of its pending legal matters with certainty, the Company does not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 84 NIKE, INC.
