We strive to optimize the overall performance improvements of our products by balancing increased performance capabilities with improved energy efficiency. Increased performance can include faster processing performance and other improved capabilities, such as multithreading and multitasking. Performance can also be improved through enhanced connectivity, storage, security, manageability, utilization, reliability, ease of use, and interoperability among devices. Improved energy efficiency is achieved by lowering power consumption in relation to performance capabilities, which may extend utilization time for battery-powered form factors and reduce system heat output, thereby providing power savings and reducing the total cost of ownership. We offer products at various levels of integration, to allow our customers flexibility in creating computing and communications systems. The substantial majority of our revenue is from the sale of microprocessors and chipsets. Components Microprocessors A microprocessorthe central processing unit (CPU) of a computer systemprocesses system data and controls other devices in the system, acting as the brains of the computer. We offer microprocessors with one or multiple processor cores designed for notebooks, netbooks, desktops, servers, workstations, storage products, embedded applications, communications products, consumer electronics devices, and handhelds. The following are characteristics of our microprocessors: ##TABLE_START   Multi-core microprocessors contain two or more processor cores, which can enable improved multitasking and energy-efficient performance by distributing computing tasks across multiple cores.   Cache is memory that can be located directly on the microprocessor. Incorporating additional amounts and/or levels of cache can enable higher performance by permitting quicker access to frequently used data and instructions.   Some of our microprocessors also include an integrated memory controller or an integrated memory controller and integrated graphics functionality. Both an integrated memory controller and integrated graphics functionality can increase the speed at which data is transferred between system components. ##TABLE_END Most of our microprocessors are based on the latest generation Intel  Core tm microarchitecture and are manufactured using our 45-nanometer (nm) Hi-k metal gate silicon process technology (45nm process technology) or our 32nm second-generation Hi-k metal gate silicon process technology (32nm process technology). These technologies are the first to use Hi-k metal gate transistors, which increase performance while simultaneously reducing the leakage of currents. Microarchitecture refers to the layout, density, and logical design of a microprocessor. The latest generation Intel Core microarchitecture incorporates features designed to increase performance and energy efficiency, such as: ##TABLE_START   Intel  Turbo Boost Technology , which increases processor frequency when applications demand more performance; and   Intel  Hyper-Threading Technology , which allows each processor core to process two software tasks or threads simultaneously. ##TABLE_END We also offer, and are continuing to develop, System on Chip (SoC) products that integrate our core processing functionalities with other system components, such as graphics, audio, and video, onto a single chip to form a purpose-built solution. SoC products are designed to provide improved performance due to higher integration, lower power consumption, and smaller form factors. Chipsets The chipset operates as the nervous system in a PC or other computing device, sending data between the microprocessor and input, display, and storage devices, such as the keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard drive or solid-state drive, and CD, DVD, or Blu-ray* drive. We offer chipsets designed for notebooks, netbooks, desktops, servers, workstations, storage products, embedded applications, communications products, consumer electronics devices, and handhelds. Chipsets extend the audio, video, and other capabilities of many systems and perform essential logic functions, such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks. Some chipsets may also include graphics functionality or graphics functionality and a memory controller, for use with our microprocessors that do not integrate those system components. Motherboards We offer motherboard products designed for our desktop, server, and workstation platforms. A motherboard is the principal board within a system, and typically contains the microprocessor, chipset, memory, and other components. The motherboard also has connectors for attaching devices to the bus, which is the subsystem that transfers data between various components of a computer. Wireless and Wired Connectivity We offer wireless and wired connectivity products, including network adapters and embedded wireless cards, based on industry-standard protocols used to translate and transmit data across networks. Wireless connectivity products based on WiFi technology allow users to wirelessly connect to high-speed local area networks, typically within a close range. We have also developed wireless connectivity products for both mobile and fixed networks based on WiMAX, a standards-based wireless technology providing high-speed broadband connectivity that can link users and networks up to several miles apart. Platforms A platform typically includes a microprocessor, chipset, and enabling software, and may include additional hardware, services, and support. In developing our platforms, we may include components made by other companies. Platforms based on our latest generation Intel Core microarchitecture using our 32nm process technology integrate a memory controller and graphics functionality into each microprocessor, and connect the microprocessor and other components with a high-speed interconnect. We refer to certain platform brands within our product offerings as processor technologies. Microprocessor and Platform Technologies We offer features to improve microprocessor and platform capabilities that can enhance system performance and user experience. For example, we offer technologies that can help information technology managers maintain, manage, and protect enabled systems that are plugged into a power source and connected to a network, even if a computer is turned off or has a failed hard drive or operating system. Additional features can enable virtualization, in which a single computer system can function as multiple virtual systems by running multiple operating systems and applications. Virtualization can consolidate workloads and provide increased security and management capabilities. To take advantage of these and other features that we offer, a computer system must have a microprocessor that supports a chipset and BIOS (basic input/output system) that use the technology, and software that is optimized for the technology. Performance will vary depending on the system hardware and software used. Additional Product Offerings NAND flash memory is a specialized type of memory component primarily used in portable memory storage devices, digital camera memory cards, solid-state drives, and other devices. NAND flash memory retains information even when the power is off, and provides faster access to data than traditional hard drives. Because flash memory does not have any moving parts, it tolerates bumps and shocks better than devices such as rapidly spinning disk drives. Network processors are advanced, fully programmable processors used in networking equipment to rapidly manage and direct data moving across networks and the Internet. Software products include operating systems, middleware, and tools used to develop, run, and manage a wide variety of enterprise, consumer, embedded, and handheld devices. In addition, we offer software development tools, designed to complement our latest hardware technologies, that help enable the creation of applications. Healthcare products are technology-enabled devices for healthcare providers and personal healthcare that are designed to connect people and information to improve patient care and safety. Revenue by Major Operating Segment Net revenue for the PC Client Group (PCCG) operating segment, the Data Center Group (DCG) operating segment, and the other Intel architecture operating segments (Other IA) is presented as a percentage of our consolidated net revenue. Other IA includes the Embedded and Communications Group, the Digital Home Group, and the Ultra-Mobility Group operating segments.

Wind River Software Group The Wind River Software Group develops and licenses device software optimization products, including operating systems, for the needs of customers in the embedded and handheld market segments. Manufacturing and Assembly and Test As of December 26, 2009, 64% of our wafer fabrication, including microprocessors and chipsets, was conducted within the U.S. at our facilities in Arizona, Oregon, New Mexico, and Massachusetts. The remaining 36% of our wafer fabrication was conducted outside the U.S. at our facilities in Ireland and Israel. As of December 26, 2009, we primarily manufactured our products in wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations: ##TABLE_START          Products Wafer Size Process Technology Locations Microprocessors 300mm 32nm Oregon Microprocessors 300mm 45nm Israel, New Mexico, Arizona Chipsets and microprocessors 300mm 65nm Arizona, Ireland Chipsets and other products 300mm 90nm Ireland Chipsets and other products 200mm 130nm and above Massachusetts, Oregon, Ireland ##TABLE_END In addition to our current facilities, we are building a 300mm wafer fabrication facility in China that is expected to begin production on chipsets using our 65nm process technology in late 2010 or early 2011. As of December 26, 2009, the substantial majority of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers using our 45nm process technology. In the second half of 2009, we began manufacturing microprocessors using our 32nm process technology. As we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology, we incur significant start-up costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing. However, continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs. The benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor, reducing heat output from each transistor, and/or increasing the number of integrated features on each chip. These advancements can result in microprocessors that are higher performing, consume less power, and/or cost less to manufacture. We use third-party manufacturing companies (foundries) to manufacture wafers for certain components, including networking and communications products. In addition, we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture board-level products and systems, and purchase certain communications networking products from external vendors in the Asia-Pacific region. Our NAND flash memory products are manufactured by IMFT, a NAND flash memory manufacturing company that we formed with Micron Technology, Inc. Our NAND flash memory products are manufactured by IMFT using 34nm or 50nm process technology, and we expect to offer NAND flash memory products using 25nm process technology during the second quarter of 2010. We purchase 49% of the manufactured output of IMFT as of December 26, 2009. Assembly and test of NAND flash memory products is performed by Micron and other external subcontractors. See Note 11: Non-Marketable Equity Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. During 2008, we completed the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business in exchange for an ownership interest in Numonyx B.V. We are leasing a wafer fabrication facility located in Israel to Numonyx. That facility is not shown in our above listing of wafer fabrication facilities. Following the manufacturing process, the majority of our components are subject to assembly and test. We perform our components assembly and test at facilities in Malaysia, China, and Costa Rica. We are building a new assembly and test facility in Vietnam that is expected to begin production in the second half of 2010. To augment capacity, we use subcontractors to perform assembly of certain products, primarily chipsets and networking and communications products. Our employment practices are consistent with, and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by, local country law. In addition, we impose a minimum employee age requirement as well as progressive EHS requirements, regardless of local law. We have thousands of suppliers, including subcontractors, providing our various materials and service needs. We set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments. We communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary. We seek, where possible, to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources, but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country. In those cases, we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply. We have entered into long-term contracts with certain suppliers to ensure a portion of our silicon supply. Our products are typically produced at multiple Intel facilities at various sites around the world, or by subcontractors who have multiple facilities. However, some products are produced in only one Intel or subcontractor facility, and we seek to implement actions and plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Research and Development We are committed to investing in world-class technology development, particularly in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits. Research and development (RD) expenditures in 2009 were $5.7 billion ($5.7 billion in 2008 and $5.8 billion in 2007). Our RD activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms, which will in turn enable new form factors and new usage models for businesses and consumers. Our RD activities range from designing and developing products, to developing and refining manufacturing processes, to researching future technologies and products. We are focusing our RD efforts on advanced computing technologies, developing new microarchitectures, advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology, delivering the next generation of microprocessors and chipsets, improving our platform initiatives, and developing software solutions and tools to support our technologies. Our RD efforts enable new levels of performance and address areas such as energy efficiency, scalability for multi-core architectures, system manageability and security, and ease of use. We continue to make significant RD investments in the development of SoCs to enable growth in areas such as handhelds (including MIDs and smartphones), embedded applications, and consumer electronics. In addition, we continue to make significant investments in graphics and wireless technologies. As part of our RD efforts, we plan to introduce a new microarchitecture for our notebook, desktop, and Intel Xeon processors approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. We refer to this as our tick-tock technology development cadence. In 2009, we started manufacturing microprocessors using our new 32nm second-generation Hi-k metal gate silicon process technology, and we expect to introduce a new microarchitecture using our 32nm process technology in 2010. We are currently developing 22nm process technology, our next-generation process technology, and expect to begin manufacturing products using that technology in 2011. Our leadership in silicon technology has enabled us to make Moores Law a reality. Moores Law predicted that transistor density on integrated circuits would double about every two years. Our leadership in silicon technology has also helped expand on the advances anticipated by Moores Law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products and platforms optimized for a wider variety of applications. Our RD model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies, leading standards initiatives, and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies. Our RD initiatives are performed by various business groups within the company, and we centrally manage key cross-business group product initiatives to align and prioritize our RD activities across these groups. In addition, we may augment our RD initiatives by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar RD focus areas. For example, we have an agreement with Micron for joint development of NAND flash memory technologies. Employees As of December 26, 2009, we had 79,800 employees worldwide, with 55% of those employees located in the U.S. Sales and Marketing Customers We sell our products primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs). ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, we sell our products to other manufacturers, including makers of a wide range of industrial and communications equipment. Our customers also include PC and network communications products users who buy PC components and our other products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. In certain instances, we have entered into supply agreements to continue to manufacture and sell products of divested business lines to acquiring companies during certain transition periods. Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers, systems builders that purchase Intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors. We have a boxed processor program that allows distributors to sell Intel microprocessors in small quantities to these systems-builder customers; boxed processors are also available in direct retail outlets. In 2009, Hewlett-Packard Company accounted for 21% of our net revenue (20% in 2008 and 17% in 2007) and Dell Inc. accounted for 17% of our net revenue (18% in 2008 and 2007). No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue. For information about revenue and operating income by operating segment, and revenue from unaffiliated customers by geographic region/country, see Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 and Note 29: Operating Segment and Geographic Information in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Sales Arrangements Our products are sold or licensed through sales offices throughout the world. Sales of our products are typically made via purchase orders that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, private-label branding, and other matters. Most of our sales are made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology. Our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer, even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related costs of sales is deferred. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, generally 30 days after shipment or delivery. Our credit department sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual customers to control credit risk to Intel arising from outstanding account balances. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis, and from this analysis, we establish credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices, such as obtaining some form of third-party guaranty or standby letter of credit, or obtaining credit insurance for all or a portion of the account balance if necessary. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. For information about our allowance for doubtful receivables, see Schedule IIValuation and Qualifying Accounts in Part IV of this Form 10-K. Most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. On most products, there is no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. Although we have the option to grant credit for, repair, or replace defective products, there is no contractual limit on the amount of credit granted to a distributor. Distribution Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. We also utilize third-party sales representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others. Sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory; instead, their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors. Several distribution warehouses are located in close proximity to key customers. Backlog We do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is meaningful, as our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Only a small portion of our orders is non-cancelable, and the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant. Seasonal Trends Our microprocessor sales generally have followed a seasonal trend. Historically, our sales have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year. Consumer purchases of PCs have historically been higher in the second half of the year, primarily due to back-to-school and holiday demand. In addition, purchases from businesses have also historically tended to be higher in the second half of the year. Marketing Our corporate marketing objectives are to build a strong Intel corporate brand that connects with consumers, and have a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices and to make technology purchase decisions easier for them. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel Atom, Intel Pentium, Intel Celeron, Intel Xeon, and Intel Itanium trademarks make up our processor brands. We promote brand awareness and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities include television, print, and web-based advertising, as well as press relations, consumer and trade events, and industry and consumer communications. We market to consumer and business audiences, and focus on building awareness and generating demand for increased performance, power efficiency, and new capabilities. Purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the Intel Inside  Program. This program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct advertising. Through the Intel Inside Program, certain customers are licensed to place Intel logos on computers containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in marketing activities. The program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses the OEMs for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to the OEMs meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include television, print, and an increased focus on web-based marketing. We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers. Competition The semiconductor industry is dynamic, characterized by rapid advances in technology and frequent product introductions. As unit volumes of a product grow, production experience is accumulated and costs typically decrease, further competition develops, and prices decline. The life cycle of our products is very short, sometimes less than a year. These short product life cycles and other factors lead to frequent negotiations with our OEM customers, which typically are large, sophisticated buyers who are also operating in very competitive environments. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to navigate this environment, by improving our products and processes faster than our competitors, anticipating changing customer requirements, developing and launching new products and platforms, pricing our products competitively, and reducing average unit costs. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Our products compete primarily based on performance, features, price, quality, reliability, brand recognition, and availability. We are focused on offering innovative products and worldwide support for our customers at competitive prices, including providing improved energy-efficient performance, enhanced security, manageability, and integrated solutions. We believe that our platform strategy provides us with a competitive advantage. We offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured to work together to provide an optimized user computing solution compared to components that are used separately. We believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and assembly and test facilities gives us a competitive advantage. This network enables us to have more direct control over our processes, quality control, product cost, volume, timing of production, and other factors. These facilities require significant up-front capital spending and therefore make it difficult for us to reduce our costs in the short-term. Many of our competitors do not own such facilities because they may not be able to afford to do so or because their business models involve the use of third-party foundries and assembly and test subcontractors for manufacturing and assembly and test. The third-party foundries and subcontractors may also offer intellectual property, design services, and other goods and services to our competitors. These fabless semiconductor companies include Broadcom Corporation, NVIDIA Corporation, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and VIA Technologies, Inc. (VIA). Some of our competitors own portions of such facilities through investment or joint-venture arrangements with other companies. We plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work with the computing and communications industries through standards bodies, trade associations, OEMs, ODMs, and independent software and operating system vendors to help align the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models. We frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standards-setting organizations. Our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives and specification development. Our participation does not ensure that any standards or specifications adopted by these organizations will be consistent with our product planning. Microprocessors We continue to be largely dependent on the success of our microprocessor business. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to deliver new microprocessor products with increased performance capabilities and improved energy-efficient performance at competitive prices. Some of our microprocessor competitors, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), market software-compatible products that compete with our processors. We also face competition from companies offering rival architecture designs, such as Cell Broadband Engine Architecture developed jointly by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Sony Corporation, and Toshiba Corporation; Power Architecture* offered by IBM; ARM* architecture developed by ARM Limited; and Scalable Processor Architecture (SPARC*) offered by Sun Microsystems, Inc. (a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation). In addition, NVIDIA is seeking to position its graphics processors to compete with microprocessors, by shifting some of a microprocessors workload to its graphics processor. While AMD has been our primary competitor in the market segments for microprocessors used in notebooks, desktops, and servers, QUALCOMM and other companies using ARM-based designs are our primary competitors in the growing market segment for microprocessors used in handhelds, including smartphones and MIDs. Our ability to compete with QUALCOMM and other competitors in this market segment depends on our ability to design and produce high-performance, energy-efficient microprocessors at competitive prices. It also requires us to develop a software ecosystem that appeals to end users and software developers. We have taken a number of steps to build this software ecosystem, including developing the Moblin tm -based operating system and subsequently combining it with Nokia Corporations Maemo* software platform to create MeeGo*, a Linux-based software platform that will run on multiple hardware platforms; acquiring Wind River Systems, Inc.; and creating the Intel  Atom tm Developer Program. In addition, in 2009 we entered into product development collaborations with LG Electronics, Inc. and Nokia. The following is a list of our main microprocessor competitors by market segment: ##TABLE_START   Notebook: AMD and VIA   Netbook: AMD, NVIDIA, QUALCOMM, and VIA   Desktop: AMD and VIA   Server/Workstation: AMD, IBM, and Sun Microsystems   Embedded: AMD, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., and Texas Instruments Incorporated   Handheld: QUALCOMM ##TABLE_END Chipsets Our chipsets compete with chipsets produced by companies such as AMD (including chipsets marketed under the ATI Technologies, Inc. brand), Broadcom, NVIDIA, Silicon Integrated Systems Corporation, and VIA. We also compete with companies offering graphics components and other special-purpose products used in the notebook, netbook, desktop, and server market segments. One aspect of our business model is to incorporate improved performance and advanced properties into our microprocessors and chipsets, for which demand may increasingly be affected by competition from companies whose business models are based on dedicated chipsets and other components, such as graphics controllers. Flash Memory Our NAND flash memory products currently compete with NAND products primarily manufactured by Hynix Semiconductor Inc., Micron, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., SanDisk Corporation, and Toshiba. Connectivity We offer products designed for wireless and wired connectivity; the communications infrastructure, including network processors; and networked storage. Our WiFi and WiMAX products currently compete with products manufactured by Atheros Communications, Inc., Broadcom, QUALCOMM, and other smaller companies. Competition Lawsuits and Government Matters We are currently a party to a variety of lawsuits and government matters involving our competitive practices. See Note 28: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Acquisitions and Strategic Investments During 2009, we completed the acquisition of Wind River Systems, Inc., a vendor of software for embedded devices. The objective of the acquisition of Wind River Systems was to enable the introduction of products for the embedded and handheld market segments, resulting in benefits for our existing operations. See Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Intellectual Property and Licensing Intellectual property rights that apply to our various products and services include patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, and maskwork rights. We maintain a program to protect our investment in technology by attempting to ensure respect for our intellectual property rights. The extent of the legal protection given to different types of intellectual property rights varies under different countries legal systems. We intend to license our intellectual property rights where we can obtain adequate consideration. See Competition earlier in this section, Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, and Note 28: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We have filed and obtained a number of patents in the U.S. and other countries. While our patents are an important element of our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent. We and other companies in the computing, telecommunications, and related high-technology fields typically apply for and receive, in the aggregate, tens of thousands of overlapping patents annually in the U.S. and other countries. We believe that the duration of the applicable patents that we are granted is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted. As we expand our product offerings into new industries, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such product offerings. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other intellectual property, may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain licenses from such companies on favorable terms or at all. The majority of the software that we distribute, including software embedded in our component- and system-level products, is entitled to copyright protection. To distinguish Intel products from our competitors products, we have obtained certain trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with certain customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect certain details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. We have ongoing programs designed to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Compliance with Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations Our compliance efforts focus on monitoring regulatory and resource trends and setting company-wide performance targets for key resources and emissions. These targets address several parameters, including product design; chemical, energy, and water use; climate change; waste recycling; and emissions. Intel focuses on reducing natural resource use, the solid and chemical waste by-products of our manufacturing processes, and the environmental impact of our products. We currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of EHS laws and regulations. For example, lead and halogenated materials (such as certain flame retardants and plastics) have been used by the electronics industry for decades. Finding suitable replacements has been a technical challenge for the industry, and we have worked for years with our suppliers and others in the industry to develop lead-free and halogen-free solutions. We work with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), non-governmental organizations, OEMs, and retailers to help manage e-waste (which includes electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives) and promote recycling. The European Union (EU) requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that allow consumers to return products for recycling. Many states in the U.S. have similar e-waste take-back laws. The inconsistency of many e-waste take-back laws and the lack of local e-waste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts. To mitigate these problems, we communicate with our distributors to determine available options for complying with e-waste laws. Intel seeks to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers to improve energy efficiency. We take a holistic approach to power management, addressing the challenge at the silicon, package, circuit, micro/macro architecture, platform, and software levels. We recognize that climate change may cause general economic risk. For further information on the risks of climate change, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We routinely monitor energy costs to understand the long-range impacts that rising costs may have on our business. We see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations. This could include items applied to utilities that are passed along to customers, such as carbon taxes or costs associated with emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards. In particular, regulations associated with the Western Climate Initiative could have an impact on our company, because a number of our large manufacturing facilities are located in the western U.S. Proposed regulations by the EPA could impact our ability to obtain modifications in a timely manner for existing air permits at our manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Similarly, our operations in Ireland are already subject to the EUs mandatory cap and trade scheme for global-warming emissions. All of our sites also may be impacted by utility programs directed by legislation or regulatory or other pressures that are targeted to pass costs through to users. We maintain business recovery plans that are intended to ensure our ability to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business. Many of our operations are located in semi-arid regions, such as Israel and the southwestern U.S. Some climate change scenarios predict that such regions can become even more vulnerable to prolonged droughts. We have had an aggressive water conservation program in place for many years. We believe that our water conservation and recovery programs will help reduce our risk if water availability becomes more constrained in the future. We further maintain long-range plans to identify potential future water conservation actions that we can take. We are committed to sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives and working proactively with governments, environmental groups, and industry to promote global environmental sustainability. We believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the worlds environmental challenges, and we are joining forces with industry, business, and governments to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to combat climate change. For several years, we have been evaluating green design standards and incorporating green building concepts and practices into the construction of our buildings. We are in the process of obtaining Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification for an office building under construction in Israel and a newly constructed fabrication building in Arizona. We have been purchasing wind power and other forms of renewable energy at some of our major sites for several years. At the beginning of 2008, we announced plans to purchase renewable energy certificates under a multi-year contract. The purchase placed Intel at the top of the EPAs Green Power Partnership for 2008 and 2009. The purchase was intended to help stimulate the market for green power, leading to additional generating capacity and, ultimately, lower costs.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END Fluctuations in demand for our products may harm our financial results and are difficult to forecast. If demand for our products fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or for other reasons, our revenue and profitability could be harmed. Important factors that could cause demand for our products to fluctuate include: ##TABLE_START   changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in the semiconductor industry and/or the overall economy;   changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market, expectations for inflation, and energy prices;   changes in the level of customers components inventories;   competitive pressures, including pricing pressures, from companies that have competing products, chip architectures, manufacturing technologies, and marketing programs;   changes in customer product needs;   strategic actions taken by our competitors; and   market acceptance of our products. ##TABLE_END If product demand decreases, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to record an impairment on our long-lived assets, including facilities and equipment as well as intangible assets, which would increase our expenses. In addition, if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record underutilization charges, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin. Factory-planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of long-lived assets, including facilities and equipment, and cause us to accelerate depreciation. In the long term, if product demand increases, we may not be able to add manufacturing or assembly and test capacity fast enough to meet market demand. These changes in demand for our products, and changes in our customers product needs, could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results, and, in certain cases, may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us to recognize impairments of our assets. Litigation or regulatory proceedings could harm our business. We may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. As described in Note 28: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we are currently engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters, particularly with respect to competition. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of intellectual property. If we were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. The semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, and by product demand that is highly variable and subject to significant downturns that may harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized by high costs, such as those related to facility construction and equipment, RD, and employment and training of a highly skilled workforce, that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. At the same time, demand for our products is highly variable and there have been downturns, often in connection with maturing product cycles as well as downturns in general economic market conditions. These downturns have been characterized by reduced product demand, manufacturing overcapacity and resulting underutilization charges, high inventory levels, and lower average selling prices. The combination of these factors may cause our revenue, gross margin, cash flow, and profitability to vary significantly in both the short and long term. We operate in intensely competitive industries, and our failure to respond quickly to technological developments and incorporate new features into our products could harm our ability to compete. We operate in intensely competitive industries that experience rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product introductions and improvements. If we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments, we may lose our competitive position, and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete. To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful RD effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes at the same pace or ahead of our competitors. Our RD efforts are aimed at solving increasingly complex problems, and we do not expect that all of our projects will be successful. If our RD efforts are unsuccessful, our future results of operations could be materially harmed. We may not be able to develop and market these new products successfully, the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers, and products developed and new technologies offered by others may affect demand for our products. These types of events could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results, such as reducing our revenue, increasing our costs, lowering our gross margin percentage, and requiring us to recognize impairments on our assets. We invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments. We make investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives. Such investments include equity or debt instruments of public or private companies, and many of these instruments are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. These companies range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The success of these companies is dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business factors. The companies in which we invest may fail because they may not be able to secure additional funding, obtain favorable investment terms for future financings, or take advantage of liquidity events such as public offerings, mergers, and private sales. If any of these private companies fail, we could lose all or part of our investment in that company. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an equity or debt investment in a public or private company in which we have invested, we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment loss. We have significant investments in companies in the flash memory market segment, and declines in this market segment or changes in managements plans with respect to our investments in this market segment could result in significant impairment charges, impacting gains (losses) on equity method investments and gains (losses) on other equity investments. Furthermore, when the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved, or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives, we may decide to dispose of the investment. Our non-marketable equity investments in private companies are not liquid, and we may not be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our results. Additionally, for cases in which we are required under equity method accounting to recognize a proportionate share of another companys income or loss, such income or loss may impact our earnings. Gains or losses from equity securities could vary from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities, gains or losses from equity method investments, and impairment charges related to debt instruments as well as equity and other investments. Our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations (see Critical Accounting Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K). Such methods, estimates, and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates, and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates, and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations. Fluctuations in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results. Because of the wide price differences among and within notebook, netbook, desktop, and server microprocessors, the mix and types of performance capabilities of microprocessors sold affect the average selling price of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue and gross margin. Our financial results also depend in part on the mix of other products that we sell, such as chipsets, flash memory, and other semiconductor products. In addition, more recently introduced products tend to have higher associated costs because of initial overall development and production ramp. Fluctuations in the mix and types of our products may also affect the extent to which we are able to recover the fixed costs and investments associated with a particular product, and as a result can harm our financial results. Our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our results of operations and financial condition. We have sales offices, RD, manufacturing, and assembly and test facilities in many countries, and as a result, we are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products in particular countries, which could, in turn, harm our results of operations and financial condition, including: ##TABLE_START   security concerns, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, and terrorist activity;   health concerns;   natural disasters;   inefficient and limited infrastructure and disruptions, such as large-scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities or telecommunications providers and supply chain interruptions;   differing employment practices and labor issues;   local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices;   regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions; and   restrictions on our operations by governments seeking to support local industries, nationalization of our operations, and restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings. ##TABLE_END In addition, although substantially all of our products are sold in U.S. dollars, we incur a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as conduct certain investing and financing activities, in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, changes in tariff and import regulations and in U.S. and non-U.S. monetary policies may harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our expenses and reducing our revenue. Varying tax rates in different jurisdictions could harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our overall tax rate. We maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property, casualty, and other risks. We place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions. However, there is a risk that one or more of our insurance providers may be unable to pay a claim. The types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location, depending on availability, cost, and our decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis. Losses not covered by insurance may be substantial and may increase our expenses, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Failure to meet our production targets, resulting in undersupply or oversupply of products, may harm our business and results of operations. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. Disruptions in this process can result from interruptions in our processes, errors, and difficulties in our development and implementation of new processes; defects in materials; disruptions in our supply of materials or resources; and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to, for example, accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditionsall of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. We may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes. The occurrence of any of the foregoing may result in our failure to meet or increase production as desired, resulting in higher costs or substantial decreases in yields, which could affect our ability to produce sufficient volume to meet specific product demand. The unavailability or reduced availability of certain products could make it more difficult to implement our platform strategy. We may also experience increases in yields. A substantial increase in yields could result in higher inventory levels and the possibility of resulting underutilization charges as we slow production to reduce inventory levels. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business and results of operations. We may have difficulties obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing, assembling and testing our products, or operating other aspects of our business, which could harm our ability to meet demand for our products and may increase our costs. We have thousands of suppliers providing various materials that we use in the production of our products and other aspects of our business, and we seek, where possible, to have several sources of supply for all of those materials. However, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country, for these materials. The inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or could make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. In addition, production could be disrupted by the unavailability of the resources used in production, such as water, silicon, electricity, and gases. Future environmental regulations could restrict the supply or increase the cost of certain of the materials that we currently use in our business. The unavailability or reduced availability of the materials or resources that we use in our business may require us to reduce production of products or may require us to incur additional costs in order to obtain an adequate supply of those materials or resources. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business and results of operations. Costs related to product defects and errata may harm our results of operations and business. Costs associated with unexpected product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) due to, for example, unanticipated problems in our manufacturing processes, include: ##TABLE_START   writing off the value of inventory of defective products;   disposing of defective products that cannot be fixed;   recalling defective products that have been shipped to customers;   providing product replacements for, or modifications to, defective products; and/or   defending against litigation related to defective products. ##TABLE_END These costs could be substantial and may therefore increase our expenses and lower our gross margin. In addition, our reputation with our customers or users of our products could be damaged as a result of such product defects and errata, and the demand for our products could be reduced. These factors could harm our financial results and the prospects for our business. We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, which could harm our business. Third parties may assert against us or our customers alleged patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. As described in Note 28: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we are currently engaged in a number of litigation matters involving intellectual property rights. We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals and companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of asserting such claims against other companies. Any claims that our products or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others, regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims, could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to, defending, and resolving such claims, and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business. As a result of such intellectual property infringement claims, we could be required or otherwise decide that it is appropriate to: ##TABLE_START   pay third-party infringement claims;   discontinue manufacturing, using, or selling particular products subject to infringement claims;   discontinue using the technology or processes subject to infringement claims;   develop other technology not subject to infringement claims, which could be time-consuming and costly or may not be possible; and/or   license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. ##TABLE_END The occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment of our assets, which would reduce the value of our assets and increase expenses. In addition, if we alter or discontinue our production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed. We may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business. Our ability to enforce our patents, copyrights, software licenses, and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid, is otherwise not enforceable, or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim. In addition, our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own or assert other claims against us, which could harm our business. If we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation, we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction, or we may have to pay damages that could, in turn, harm our results of operations. In addition, governments may adopt regulations, and governments or courts may render decisions, requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others, or governments may require that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business. We may be subject to intellectual property theft or misuse, which could result in third-party claims and harm our business and results of operations. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet to our information technology systems by, for example, masquerading as authorized users or surreptitious introduction of software. These attempts, which might be the result of industrial or other espionage, or actions by hackers seeking to harm the company, its products, or end users, are sometimes successful. One recent and sophisticated incident occurred in January 2010 around the same time as the recently publicized security incident reported by Google. We seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft and/or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce marketplace acceptance of our products; the value of our investment in RD, product development, and marketing could be reduced; and third parties might assert against us or our customers claims related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information or end-user data and/or system reliability. Our business could be subject to significant disruption, and we could suffer monetary and other losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm, in the event of such incidents and claims. Our licenses with other companies and our participation in industry initiatives may allow other companies, including our competitors, to use our patent rights. Companies in the semiconductor industry often rely on the ability to license patents from each other in order to compete. Many of our competitors have broad licenses or cross-licenses with us, and under current case law, some of the licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others. If one of these licensees becomes a foundry, our competitors might be able to avoid our patent rights in manufacturing competing products. In addition, our participation in industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies that adopt certain industry standards or specifications, even when such organizations do not adopt standards or specifications proposed by us. As a result, our patents implicated by our participation in industry initiatives might not be available for us to enforce against others who might otherwise be deemed to be infringing those patents, our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our intellectual property may be impaired. Decisions about the scope of operations of our business could affect our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in the business environment could lead to changes in our decisions about the scope of operations of our business, and these changes could result in restructuring and asset impairment charges. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations with regard to changing the scope of our operations include: ##TABLE_START   timing and execution of plans and programs that may be subject to local labor law requirements, including consultation with appropriate work councils;   changes in assumptions related to severance and postretirement costs;   future divestitures;   new business initiatives and changes in product roadmap, development, and manufacturing;   changes in employment levels and turnover rates;   changes in product demand and the business environment; and   changes in the fair value of certain long-lived assets. ##TABLE_END Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and enter into agreements regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions, such as joint ventures. Acquisitions and other transactions involve significant challenges and risks, including risks that: ##TABLE_START   we may not be able to identify suitable opportunities at terms acceptable to us;   the transaction may not advance our business strategy;   we may not realize a satisfactory return on the investment we make;   we may not be able to retain key personnel of the acquired business; or   we may experience difficulty in integrating new employees, business systems, and technology. ##TABLE_END When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions. These circumstances could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to businesses that we want to dispose of, or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, resulting in a loss on the transaction. If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to: ##TABLE_START   failure to obtain required regulatory or other approvals;   intellectual property or other litigation;   difficulties that we or other parties may encounter in obtaining financing for the transaction; or   other factors. ##TABLE_END Further, acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. These factors could harm our business and results of operations. In order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate key employees, and our failure to do so could harm our results of operations. In order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees in the semiconductor industry can be intense. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. Our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations worldwide could harm our business and results of operations. The manufacturing and assembling and testing of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of EHS laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with any of those applicable laws or regulations could result in: ##TABLE_START   regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities;   suspension of production;   alteration of our fabrication and assembly and test processes; and   curtailment of our operations or sales. ##TABLE_END In addition, our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or future liabilities. Existing and future environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify our product designs, or incur other expenses associated with such laws and regulations. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under existing or future environmental laws and regulations that may restrict our use of one or more of such materials in our manufacturing, assembly and test processes, or products. Any of these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct our business. In addition to the possible direct economic impact that climate change could have on us, climate change mitigation programs and regulations can increase our costs. For example, the cost of perfluorocompounds (PFCs), a gas that we use in our manufacturing, could increase over time under some climate-change-focused emissions trading programs that may be imposed by government regulation. If the use of PFCs is prohibited, we would need to obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. In addition, air quality permit requirements for our manufacturing operations could become more burdensome and cause delays in our ability to modify our facilities. We also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations. Our costs could increase if utility companies pass on their costs, such as those associated with carbon taxes, emission cap and trade programs, or renewable portfolio standards. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disasters or events. Many of our operations are located in semi-arid regions, such as Israel and the southwestern U.S. Some scenarios predict that these regions may become even more vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. Changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations. A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including: ##TABLE_START   the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;   the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;   changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in deferred tax valuation allowances;   adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;   increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;   changes in available tax credits;   changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, and changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and   our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. ##TABLE_END Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods. Interest and other, net could be harmed by macroeconomic and other factors. Factors that could cause interest and other, net in our consolidated statements of operations to fluctuate include: ##TABLE_START   fixed-income, equity, and credit market volatility;   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;   fluctuations in interest rates;   changes in our cash and investment balances; and   changes in our hedge accounting treatment. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the Business Outlook section (see also Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). Our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of February 22, 2010. Overview Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy. Our primary component-level products include microprocessors, chipsets, and flash memory. To better align our major product groups around the core competencies of Intel architecture and our manufacturing operations, we completed the reorganization of our business in the fourth quarter of 2009. Net revenue, gross margin, operating income, and net income for the fourth and third quarters of 2009, and fiscal year 2009 and 2008 were as follows: ##TABLE_START                  Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec. 26, Sept. 26, Dec. 26, Dec. 27, (In Millions) 2009 2009 2009 2008 Net revenue $ 10,569 $ 9,389 $ 35,127 $ 37,586 Gross margin $ 6,840 $ 5,404 $ 19,561 $ 20,844 Operating income $ 2,497 $ 2,579 $ 5,711 $ 8,954 Net income $ 2,282 $ 1,856 $ 4,369 $ 5,292 ##TABLE_END We started the year in one of the deepest recessions in our history and emerged from it with better products and technology in a strengthening market. Compared to the first quarter of 2008, revenue was down 26% in the first quarter of 2009, with the second and third quarters down 15% and 8%, respectively, compared to the second and third quarters of 2008. However, our fourth quarter results reflected a strengthening demand across all regions and all product categories, driven primarily by the notebook market segment. Fourth quarter revenue of $10.6 billion was up 13% compared to the third quarter, nearly twice the seasonal average, and up 28% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The launch of our microprocessor products using 32nm process technology was strong in the fourth quarter and was one of the contributors to the increase in our overall microprocessor average selling prices compared to the third quarter. Our server products also had a strong quarter, and we saw a demand shift toward higher end products, which also contributed to the increase in our average selling prices. Despite these fourth quarter increases, our microprocessor average selling prices in 2009 were lower than in 2008, driven primarily by decreases in average selling prices in the notebook and desktop market segments. With the launch of our 32nm products and fourth quarter record shipments of microprocessor units, we are entering 2010 in a strong competitive position as we continue delivering improvements in our product offerings through the tick-tock manufacturing process technology and product development cadence. Additionally, our Intel Atom processors and related chipsets continue their strong ramp, with revenue having increased nearly $900 million in 2009 compared to 2008. We believe our total inventory levels of $2.9 billion, though up compared to the third quarter of 2009, are appropriate based on our forecasts. We believe that OEM component inventories are roughly flat compared to the third quarter and below levels at the end of 2008. Additionally, our distributors inventories are down compared to the third quarter. Our fourth quarter gross margin percentage of 64.7% set a new quarterly record. The fourth quarter gross margin percentage compared to the third quarter was positively impacted by lower inventory write-offs, higher microprocessor average selling prices and unit sales, the lack of excess capacity charges, and improving unit costs. In the first quarter of 2010, we expect our gross margin percentage to decrease due to higher unit costs as we continue to ramp our 32nm products, as well as seasonally lower microprocessor unit sales and lower microprocessor average selling prices. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we made a $1.25 billion payment to AMD as part of a settlement to end all outstanding litigation between the companies, including antitrust litigation and cross-license patent disputes. Also in the fourth quarter of 2009, the New York Attorney General and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed antitrust suits against Intel. For further information on our litigation matters, see Note 28: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. From a financial condition perspective, we ended 2009 with an investment portfolio of $13.9 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, debt instruments included in trading assets, and short-term investments. During 2009, we generated $11.2 billion in cash from operations despite paying the 1.06 billion ($1.447 billion) European Commission fine recorded in the second quarter of 2009, and the AMD settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. During 2009, we issued $2.0 billion of convertible debt and utilized the proceeds from the convertible debt to repurchase $1.7 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. In addition, during 2009 we returned $3.1 billion to stockholders through dividends. In January 2010, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.1575 per common share for the first quarter of 2010, an increase of 12.5% compared to our fourth quarter dividend. In February 2010, we signed a definitive agreement with Micron and Numonyx under which Micron agreed to acquire Numonyx in an all-stock transaction. For further information, see Note 11: Non-Marketable Equity Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Strategy Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy. As part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment, we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits, as well as our financial resources, global presence, brand recognition, and software development. We believe that we have the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers needs quickly. Some of our key focus areas are listed below: ##TABLE_START   Customer Orientation. Our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of products based on the needs and expectations of our customers. In turn, our products help enable the design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers. We offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured to work together to provide an optimized computing solution compared to components that are used separately.   Architecture and Platforms. We are focusing on improved energy-efficient performance for computing and communications systems and devices. Improved energy-efficient performance involves balancing improved performance with lower power consumption. We continue to develop multi-core microprocessors with an increasing number of cores, which enable improved multitasking and energy efficiency. In addition, to meet the demands of new and evolving netbook, consumer electronics, and various embedded market segments, we offer and are continuing to develop SoC products that are designed to provide improved performance due to higher integration, lower power consumption, and smaller form factors.   Silicon and Manufacturing Technology Leadership. Our strategy for developing microprocessors with improved performance is to synchronize the introduction of a new microarchitecture with improvements in silicon process technology. We plan to introduce a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. This coordinated schedule allows us to develop and introduce new products based on a common microarchitecture quickly, without waiting for the next generation of silicon process technology. We refer to this as our tick-tock technology development cadence. In keeping with this cadence, we expect to introduce a new microarchitecture using our 32nm process technology in 2010.   Strategic Investments. We make investments in companies around the world that we believe will generate financial returns, further our strategic objectives, and support our key business initiatives. Our investments, including those made through our Intel Capital program, generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital economy, create new business opportunities for Intel, and expand global markets for our products. Our current investments primarily focus on the following areas: advancing flash memory products, enabling mobile wireless devices, advancing the digital home, enhancing the digital enterprise, advancing high-performance communications infrastructures, and developing the next generation of silicon process technologies.   Business Environment and Software. We believe that we are well positioned in the technology industry to help drive innovation, foster collaboration, and promote industry standards that will yield innovation and improved technologies for users. We plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work to encourage the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models. We frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standards-setting organizations. Through our Software and Services Group, we help enable and advance the computing ecosystem by providing development tools and support to help software developers create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platforms. Lastly, we believe that the software expertise of our Wind River Software Group in the embedded and handheld market segments will expedite our growth strategy in these market segments. ##TABLE_END We believe that the proliferation of the Internet, including user demand for premium content and rich media, drives the need for greater performance in PCs and servers. Older PCs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that businesses and individual consumers demand, such as streaming video, web conferencing, online gaming, and other memory-intensive applications. As these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power, we believe that businesses and individual consumers will need and want to buy new PCs. We also believe that increased Internet traffic and the increasing use of cloud computing, in which a group of linked servers provide a variety of applications and data to users over the Internet, create a need for greater server infrastructure, including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance and virtualization. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We believe that the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop microprocessor units will continue and that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require low-power microprocessors. We also believe that these products will result in demand that is incremental to that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers, as a growing number of households have multiple devices for different computing functions. Our silicon and manufacturing technology leadership allows us to develop low-power microprocessors for these and other new uses and form factors. We believe that Intel Atom processors give us the ability to extend Intel architecture and drive growth in new market segments, including a growing number of products that require processors specifically designed for embedded applications, handhelds, consumer electronics devices, and netbooks. We expect that our Intel Atom Developer Program will spur new applications that run on products using Intel Atom processors, which will expedite our growth strategy in these new market segments. The common elements for products in these new market segments are low power consumption and the ability to access the Internet. We are also focusing on the development of a new highly scalable, many-core architecture aimed at parallel processing, the simultaneous use of multiple cores to execute a computing task. This architecture will initially be used as a software development platform for graphics and throughput computing (the need for large amounts of computing performance consistently over a long period of time). Over time, this architecture may be utilized in the development of products for scientific and professional workstations as well as high-performance computing applications. In addition, we offer, and are continuing to develop, advanced NAND flash memory products, focusing on system-level solutions for Intel architecture platforms such as solid-state drives. In support of our strategy to provide advanced flash memory products, we continue to focus on the development of innovative products designed to address the needs of customers for reliable, non-volatile, low-cost, high-density memory. Strategy by Major Market Segment The strategy for our PC Client Group operating segment is to offer products that are incorporated into notebook, netbook, and desktop computers for consumers and businesses. Our strategy for the notebook computing market segment is to offer notebook PC products designed to improve performance, battery life, and wireless connectivity, as well as to allow for the design of smaller, lighter, and thinner form factors. We are also increasing our focus on notebook products designed to offer technologies that provide increased manageability and security, and we continue to invest in the build-out of WiMAX. Our strategy for the netbook computing market segment is to offer products that enable affordable, Internet-focused devices with small form factors. Our strategy for the desktop computing market segment is to offer products that provide increased manageability, security, and energy-efficient performance while lowering total cost of ownership for businesses. For consumers in the desktop computing market segment, we also focus on the design of components for high-end enthusiast PCs and mainstream PCs with rich audio and video capabilities. The strategy for our Data Center Group operating segment is to offer products that provide leading performance, energy-efficiency, and virtualization technology for server, workstation, and storage platforms. We are also increasing our focus on products designed for high-performance and mission-critical computing, cloud computing services, and emerging markets. In addition, we offer wired connectivity devices that are incorporated into products that make up the infrastructure for the Internet. The strategies for our other Intel architecture operating segments include: ##TABLE_START   driving Intel architecture as a solution for embedded applications by delivering long life-cycle support, software and architectural scalability, and platform integration;   continuing to develop and offer products that enable handhelds to deliver digital content and the Internet to users in new ways; and   offering products and solutions for use in consumer electronics devices designed to access and share Internet, broadcast, optical media, and personal content through a variety of linked digital devices within the home. ##TABLE_END 28 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Critical Accounting Estimates The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: ##TABLE_START   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity method investments, net, or gains (losses) on other equity investments, net when we record impairments;   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation;   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and   the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin. ##TABLE_END Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. Non-Marketable Equity Investments We regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $3.4 billion as of December 26, 2009 ($4.1 billion as of December 27, 2008). The majority of this balance as of December 26, 2009 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment. Our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in IMFT and IM Flash Singapore, LLP (IMFS) of $1.6 billion ($2.1 billion as of December 27, 2008). For further information, see Note 11: Non-Marketable Equity Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using adjusted cost basis or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment (see Note 2: Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Our non-marketable equity investments are classified in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and a number of the companies in which we invest could fail. Their success is dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business factors. Depending on their future prospects, the companies may not be able to raise additional funds when the funds are needed or they may receive lower valuations, with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings, and our investments would likely become impaired. Additionally, financial markets and credit markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. For further information about our investment portfolio risks, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as projected revenues, earnings, and comparable performance multiples. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies sizes, growth rates, industries, development stages, and other relevant factors. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee: revenue, based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share; expenses, capital spending, and other costs; and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of market segment size, market segment share, expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed by the investee and/or Intel using historical data and available market data. The valuation of our non-marketable investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, the investees capital structure, and differences in seniority and rights associated with the investees capital. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) For non-marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment, such as: ##TABLE_START   the investees revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects;   the technological feasibility of the investees products and technologies;   the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes;   factors related to the investees ability to remain in business, such as the investees liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and   the investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. ##TABLE_END If the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal. If the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value. Impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $221 million in 2009. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2009, impairments of non-marketable equity investments ranged from $11 million to $896 million per quarter. This range included impairments of $896 million during the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily related to a $762 million impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC). IMFT/IMFS IMFT and IMFS are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell NAND products to Intel and Micron at manufacturing cost. We determine the fair value of our investment in IMFT/IMFS using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our NAND Solutions Group business, which requires the use of unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs that require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments are the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate. Changes in management estimates for these unobservable inputs have the most significant effect on the fair value determination. We did not have an other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in IMFT/IMFS in 2009, 2008, or 2007. It is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination could change in the near term, which could result in an impairment of our investment. Long-Lived Assets We assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset groupings carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset groupings carrying value and its fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Long-lived assets such as goodwill; intangible assets; and property, plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets, and are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. Impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets new, shorter useful lives. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2009, impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $40 million to $300 million per quarter. For further discussion on these asset impairment charges, see Note 19: Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Income Taxes We must make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity, and effectively settled issues. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Inventory The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. The estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. As of December 26, 2009, we had total work-in-process inventory of $1,469 million and total finished goods inventory of $1,029 million. The demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin. In order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings of wafers compared to total available capacity. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory, and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Over the past 12 quarters, excess capacity charges ranged from zero to $680 million per quarter. Accounting Changes and Recent Accounting Standards For a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3: Accounting Changes and Note 4: Recent Accounting Standards in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated: ##TABLE_START                          2009 2008 2007 % of % of % of (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Dollars Revenue Dollars Revenue Dollars Revenue Net revenue $ 35,127 100.0 % $ 37,586 100.0 % $ 38,334 100.0 % Cost of sales 15,566 44.3 % 16,742 44.5 % 18,430 48.1 % Gross margin 19,561 55.7 % 20,844 55.5 % 19,904 51.9 % Research and development 5,653 16.1 % 5,722 15.2 % 5,755 15.0 % Marketing, general and administrative 7,931 22.6 % 5,452 14.6 % 5,401 14.1 % Restructuring and asset impairment charges 231 0.6 % 710 1.9 % 516 1.3 % Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 35 0.1 % 6  % 16 0.1 % Operating income 5,711 16.3 % 8,954 23.8 % 8,216 21.4 % Gains (losses) on equity method investments, net (147 ) (0.4 )% (1,380 ) (3.7 )% 3  % Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net (23 ) (0.1 )% (376 ) (1.0 )% 154 0.4 % Interest and other, net 163 0.4 % 488 1.3 % 793 2.1 % Income before taxes 5,704 16.2 % 7,686 20.4 % 9,166 23.9 % Provision for taxes 1,335 3.8 % 2,394 6.3 % 2,190 5.7 % Net income $ 4,369 12.4 % $ 5,292 14.1 % $ 6,976 18.2 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 0.77 $ 0.92 $ 1.18 ##TABLE_END The following graphs set forth revenue information of geographic regions for the periods indicated: Geographic Breakdown of Revenue Our net revenue for 2009 decreased 7% compared to 2008. Average selling prices for microprocessors and chipsets decreased and microprocessor and chipset unit sales increased, compared to 2008, primarily due to the ramp of Intel Atom processors and chipsets, which generally have lower average selling prices than our other microprocessor and chipset products. Revenue from the sale of NOR flash memory products and communications products declined $740 million, primarily as a result of business divestitures. Additionally, an increase in revenue from the sale of NAND flash memory products was mostly offset by a decrease in revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity products. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Revenue in the Asia-Pacific region increased 2% compared to 2008, while revenue in the Europe, Japan, and Americas regions decreased by 26%, 15%, and 4%, respectively, compared to 2008. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2009 decreased $1.3 billion, or 6%, compared to 2008. Our overall gross margin percentage increased slightly to 55.7% in 2009 from 55.5% in 2008. The slight increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increases in the NAND Solutions Group and Data Center Group operating segments offset by the gross margin percentage decrease in the PC Client Group operating segment. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2009, and most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2008, from the sales of microprocessors in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. See Business Outlook for a discussion of gross margin expectations. Our net revenue for 2008 decreased 2% compared to 2007. Higher revenue from the sale of microprocessors and chipsets was more than offset by the impacts of divestitures and lower revenue from the sale of motherboards. Revenue from the sale of NOR flash memory and cellular baseband products declined $1.7 billion, primarily as a result of divestiture of these businesses. Revenue in the Americas region decreased 4% in 2008 compared to 2007. Revenue in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Japan regions remained approximately flat in 2008 compared to 2007. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2008 were $20.8 billion, an increase of $940 million, or 5%, compared to 2007. Our overall gross margin percentage increased to 55.5% in 2008 from 51.9% in 2007. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increase in the PC Client Group operating segment and, to a lesser extent, the gross margin percentage increase in the Data Center Group operating segment. In addition, our gross margin percentage increased due to the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business. We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2008 and 2007 from the sale of microprocessors in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. PC Client Group The revenue and operating income for the PC Client Group (PCCG) for the three years ended December 26, 2009 were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Microprocessor revenue $ 19,914 $ 21,516 $ 21,053 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 6,261 6,450 6,077 Net revenue $ 26,175 $ 27,966 $ 27,130 Operating income $ 7,585 $ 9,419 $ 8,535 ##TABLE_END Net revenue for the PCCG operating segment decreased by $1.8 billion, or 6%, in 2009 compared to 2008. Microprocessors and chipsets within PCCG include those designed for the notebook, netbook, and desktop computing market segments. The decrease in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to lower notebook microprocessor average selling prices, and lower desktop microprocessor unit sales and average selling prices. These decreases were partially offset by a significant increase in netbook microprocessor unit sales due to the ramp of Intel Atom processors. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset average selling prices and lower unit sales of wireless connectivity products, partially offset by higher chipset unit sales. Operating income decreased by $1.8 billion, or 19%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue and approximately $810 million of higher factory underutilization charges, partially offset by lower chipset and microprocessor unit costs. For 2008, net revenue for the PCCG operating segment increased slightly by $836 million, or 3%, compared to 2007. The increase in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to significantly higher notebook microprocessor unit sales, partially offset by significantly lower notebook microprocessor average selling prices. In addition, lower desktop microprocessor unit sales were partially offset by the ramp of Intel Atom processors. The increase in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to higher chipset unit sales, partially offset by lower desktop motherboard unit sales. Operating income increased by $884 million, or 10%, in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily due to lower microprocessor and chipset unit costs, partially offset by lower desktop microprocessor and chipset revenue and higher operating expenses. In addition, approximately $230 million of lower start-up costs were offset by sales in 2007 of desktop microprocessors that had previously been written off, and higher write-offs of desktop microprocessor inventory in 2008. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Data Center Group The revenue and operating income for the Data Center Group (DCG) for the three years ended December 26, 2009 were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Microprocessor revenue $ 5,301 $ 5,126 $ 4,796 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 1,149 1,464 1,659 Net revenue $ 6,450 $ 6,590 $ 6,455 Operating income $ 2,299 $ 2,135 $ 2,105 ##TABLE_END Net revenue for the DCG operating segment decreased slightly by $140 million, or 2%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor average selling prices, partially offset by lower microprocessor unit sales. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset average selling prices. Operating income increased by $164 million, or 8%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher microprocessor revenue and lower operating expenses, partially offset by approximately $150 million of higher start-up costs as well as lower chipset revenue. For 2008, net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased slightly by $135 million, or 2%, compared to 2007. The increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor average selling prices. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to lower motherboard unit sales. Operating income was flat in 2008 compared to 2007. Higher revenue was mostly offset by higher operating expenses. Other Intel Architecture Operating Segments The revenue and operating income for the other Intel architecture operating segments (Other IA) for the three years ended December 26, 2009 were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net revenue $ 1,402 $ 1,763 $ 1,908 Operating income (loss) $ (179 ) $ (63 ) $ 47 ##TABLE_END Net revenue for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $361 million, or 20%, in 2009 compared to 2008, and operating loss for the Other IA operating segments increased by $116 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The changes were primarily due to lower revenue from the sale of communications products within the Embedded and Communications Group (ECG), primarily as a result of business divestitures. For 2008, net revenue for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $145 million, or 8%, compared to 2007. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue from the sale of communications products within ECG, primarily as a result of business divestitures, partially offset by higher ECG microprocessor unit sales. Operating income (loss) decreased by $110 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease was primarily due to higher operating expenses within the Ultra-Mobility Group and, to a lesser extent, within the Digital Home Group. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three years ended December 26, 2009 were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Research and development $ 5,653 $ 5,722 $ 5,755 Marketing, general and administrative $ 7,931 $ 5,452 $ 5,401 Restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 231 $ 710 $ 516 Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles $ 35 $ 6 $ 16 ##TABLE_END Research and Development. RD spending was flat in 2009 compared to 2008, and was flat in 2008 compared to 2007. In 2009 compared to 2008, we had lower process development costs as we transitioned from RD to manufacturing using our 32nm process technology. This decrease was offset by higher profit-dependent compensation expenses. In 2008 compared to 2007, we had lower product development expenses resulting from our divested businesses and slightly lower profit-dependent compensation. These decreases were offset by higher process development costs as we transitioned from manufacturing start-up costs related to our 45nm process technology to RD of our 32nm process technology. Marketing, General and Administrative. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased $2.5 billion, or 45%, in 2009 compared to 2008, and were flat in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the charge of $1.447 billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the European Commission (EC) and the $1.25 billion payment to AMD as part of a settlement agreement (see Note 28: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). To a lesser extent, we had higher profit-dependent compensation expenses that were partially offset by lower advertising expenses, including cooperative advertising expenses. In 2008 compared to 2007, we had higher legal expenses that were offset by lower profit-dependent compensation and lower advertising expenses. RD, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 39% of net revenue in 2009, 30% of net revenue in 2008, and 29% of net revenue in 2007. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. The following table summarizes restructuring and asset impairment charges by plan for the three years ended December 26, 2009: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009 restructuring program $ 215 $  $  2008 NAND plan  215  2006 efficiency program 16 495 516 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 231 $ 710 $ 516 ##TABLE_END 2009 Restructuring Program In the first quarter of 2009, management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing and assembly and test operations. These plans included closing two assembly and test facilities in Malaysia, one facility in the Philippines, and one facility in China; stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Oregon; and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in California. We do not expect significant future charges related to the 2009 plan. The following table summarizes charges for the 2009 restructuring plan during 2009: ##TABLE_START      (In Millions) 2009 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $ 208 Asset impairments 7 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 215 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2009 restructuring plan during 2009: ##TABLE_START              Employee Severance Asset (In Millions) and Benefits Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2008 $  $  $  Additional accruals 223 7 230 Adjustments (15 )  (15 ) Cash payments (182 )  (182 ) Non-cash settlements  (7 ) (7 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2009 $ 26 $  $ 26 ##TABLE_END The net charges above include $208 million that relate to employee severance and benefit arrangements for 6,500 employees, of which 5,400 employees had left the company as of December 26, 2009. Most of these employee actions occurred within manufacturing. We estimate that these employee severance and benefit charges will result in gross annual savings of approximately $290 million. The substantial majority of the savings will be realized within cost of sales. 2008 NAND Plan In the fourth quarter of 2008, management approved a plan with Micron to discontinue the supply of NAND flash memory from the 200mm facility within the IMFT manufacturing network. The agreement resulted in a $215 million restructuring charge, primarily related to the IMFT 200mm supply agreement. The restructuring charge resulted in a reduction of our investment in IMFT/IMFS of $184 million, a cash payment to Micron of $24 million, and other cash payments of $7 million. The 2008 NAND plan was completed at the end of 2008. 2006 Efficiency Program In the third quarter of 2006, management approved several actions as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results. The following table summarizes charges for the 2006 efficiency program for the three years ended December 26, 2009: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $ 8 $ 151 $ 289 Asset impairments 8 344 227 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 16 $ 495 $ 516 ##TABLE_END During 2006, as part of our assessment of our worldwide manufacturing capacity operations, we placed for sale our fabrication facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. As a result of placing the facility for sale, in 2006 we recorded a $214 million impairment charge to write down to fair value the land, building, and equipment. We incurred $54 million in additional asset impairment charges as a result of market conditions related to the Colorado Springs facility during 2007 and additional charges in 2008. We sold the Colorado Springs facility in 2009. In addition, during 2007 we recorded land and building write-downs related to certain facilities in Santa Clara, California. We also incurred $85 million in asset impairment charges related to assets that we sold in conjunction with the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business in 2007 and an additional $275 million in 2008. We determined the impairment charges based on the fair value, less selling costs, that we expected to receive upon completion of the divestiture in 2007, and determined the impairment charges using the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable that we received upon completion of the divestiture, less selling costs, in 2008.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2006 efficiency program during 2008 and 2009: ##TABLE_START              Employee Severance Asset (In Millions) and Benefits Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 29, 2007 $ 127 $  $ 127 Additional accruals 167 344 511 Adjustments (16 )  (16 ) Cash payments (221 )  (221 ) Non-cash settlements  (344 ) (344 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2008 $ 57 $  $ 57 Additional accruals 18 8 26 Adjustments (10 )  (10 ) Cash payments (65 )  (65 ) Non-cash settlements  (8 ) (8 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2009 $  $  $  ##TABLE_END We recorded the additional accruals, net of adjustments, as restructuring and asset impairment charges. The 2006 efficiency plan is complete. From the third quarter of 2006 through 2009, we incurred a total of $1.6 billion in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this program. These charges included a total of $686 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for 11,300 employees. A substantial majority of these employee actions affected employees within manufacturing, information technology, and marketing. The restructuring and asset impairment charges also included $896 million in asset impairment charges. We estimate that the total employee severance and benefit charges incurred as part of the 2006 efficiency program result in gross annual savings of approximately $1.1 billion. We are realizing these savings within marketing, general and administrative; cost of sales; and RD. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. The increase of $29 million was due to amortization of intangibles primarily related to the acquisition of Wind River Systems completed in the third quarter of 2009. See Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation totaled $889 million in 2009, $851 million in 2008, and $952 million in 2007. Share-based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses. As of December 26, 2009, unrecognized share-based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows: ##TABLE_START        Unrecognized Share-Based Weighted Compensation Average (Dollars in Millions) Costs Period Stock options $ 282 1.3 years Restricted stock units $ 1,196 1.4 years Stock purchase plan $ 9 1 month ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains (Losses) on Equity Method Investments, Net Gains (losses) on equity method investments, net were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Equity method losses, net $ (131 ) $ (316 ) $ (103 ) Impairment charges (42 ) (1,077 ) (28 ) Other, net 26 13 134 Total gains (losses) on equity method investments, net $ (147 ) $ (1,380 ) $ 3 ##TABLE_END Impairment charges in 2008 included a $762 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Clearwire LLC and a $250 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Numonyx. We recognized the impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire LLC to write down our investment to its fair value, primarily due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment in the fourth quarter of 2008. The impairment charge on our investment in Numonyx was due to a general decline in 2008 in the NOR flash memory market segment. Our equity method losses were primarily related to Numonyx ($31 million in 2009 and $87 million in 2008), Clearwire LLC ($27 million in 2009), and Clearwire Corporation ($184 million in 2008 and $104 million in 2007). See Note 11: Non-Marketable Equity Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. During 2007, we recognized $110 million of income due to the reorganization of one of our investments, included within Other, net in the table above. Gains (Losses) on Other Equity Investments, Net Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Impairment charges $ (179 ) $ (455 ) $ (92 ) Gains on sales, net 55 60 204 Other, net 101 19 42 Total gains (losses) on other equity investments, net $ (23 ) $ (376 ) $ 154 ##TABLE_END Impairment charges in 2008 included a $176 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Clearwire Corporation and $97 million of impairment charges on our investment in Micron. The impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire Corporation was due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008. The impairment charges on our investment in Micron reflected the difference between our cost basis and the fair value of our investment in Micron at the end of the second and third quarters of 2008. In addition, we recognized higher gains on equity derivatives in 2009 compared to 2008. Interest and Other, Net The components of interest and other, net were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 168 $ 592 $ 804 Interest expense (1 ) (8 ) (15 ) Other, net (4 ) (96 ) 4 Total interest and other, net $ 163 $ 488 $ 793 ##TABLE_END We recognized lower interest income in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of lower interest rates. The average interest rate earned during 2009 decreased by 2.4 percentage points compared to 2008. In addition, lower gains on divestitures (zero in 2009 and $59 million in 2008) were more than offset by $70 million of fair value gains in 2009 on our trading assets, compared to $130 million of fair value losses in 2008. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Interest and other, net decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to lower interest income and fair value losses that we experienced in 2008 on our trading assets. Interest income was lower in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances. The average interest rate earned during 2008 decreased by 1.9 percentage points compared to 2007. Provision for Taxes Our provision for taxes and effective tax rate were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (Dollars in Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Income before taxes $ 5,704 $ 7,686 $ 9,166 Provision for taxes $ 1,335 $ 2,394 $ 2,190 Effective tax rate 23.4 % 31.1 % 23.9 % ##TABLE_END We generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2009 compared to 2008. In addition, the 2009 tax rate was positively impacted by the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $366 million on settlements, effective settlements, and related remeasurements of various uncertain tax positions compared to a reversal of $103 million for such matters in 2008. These impacts were partially offset by the recognition of the EC fine of $1.447 billion with no associated tax benefit. In addition, our 2008 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing tax benefits related to impairments of our equity investments. Our effective income tax rate increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing tax benefits related to impairments of our equity investments. In addition, the rate increased in 2008 compared to 2007, due to the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $481 million (including $50 million of accrued interest) related to settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the first and second quarters of 2007. Business Outlook Our future results of operations and the topics of other forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, including this MDA, involve a number of risks and uncertaintiesin particular: ##TABLE_START   changes in business and economic conditions;   revenue and pricing;   gross margin and costs;   pending legal proceedings;   our effective tax rate (including changes in unrecognized tax positions);   marketing, general and administrative expenses;   our goals and strategies;   new product introductions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   plans to cultivate new businesses;   RD expenses;   divestitures or investments;   net gains (losses) from equity investments;   interest and other, net;   capital spending;   depreciation; and   impairment of investments. ##TABLE_END In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. See the risks described in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Our expectations for 2010 are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Gross Margin Percentage. 61%, plus or minus three points. The 61% midpoint is higher than our 2009 gross margin of 55.7%, primarily due to lower manufacturing period costs, mostly factory underutilization charges. In addition, we expect lower unit costs and higher unit sales, partially offset by lower average selling prices.   Total Spending. We expect spending on RD, plus marketing, general and administrative expenses, in 2010 to be approximately $11.8 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared to $13.6 billion in 2009. Total spending in 2009 included charges of $1.447 billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the EC and $1.25 billion as a result of our legal settlement with AMD.   Research and Development Spending. Approximately $6.2 billion compared to $5.7 billion in 2009.   Capital Spending. Approximately $4.8 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared to $4.5 billion in 2009.   Depreciation. Approximately $4.4 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared to $4.7 billion in 2009.   Tax Rate. Approximately 30%, compared to 23% in 2009. The estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect as of December 26, 2009 and expected income. ##TABLE_END 39 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Status of Business Outlook We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet privately with investors, investment analysts, the media, and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the Business Outlook section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. At the same time, we will keep this Form 10-K and our most current business outlook publicly available on our Investor Relations web site at www.intc.com . The public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we publish a notice stating otherwise. The statements in the Business Outlook section and other forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times. From the close of business on February 26, 2010 until our quarterly earnings release is published, presently scheduled for April 13, 2010, we will observe a quiet period. During the quiet period, the Business Outlook section and other forward-looking statements first published in our Form 8-K filed on January 14, 2010, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this Form 10-K, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. During the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations. The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources ##TABLE_START          (Dollars in Millions) Dec. 26, 2009 Dec. 27, 2008 Cash and cash equivalents, debt instruments included in trading assets, and short-term investments $ 13,920 $ 11,544 Loans receivable and other long-term investments $ 4,528 $ 2,924 Short-term and long-term debt $ 2,221 $ 1,287 Debt as % of stockholders equity 5.3 % 3.3 % ##TABLE_END Sources and Uses of Cash (In Millions) In summary, our cash flows were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,170 $ 10,926 $ 12,625 Net cash used for investing activities (7,965 ) (5,865 ) (9,926 ) Net cash used for financing activities (2,568 ) (9,018 ) (1,990 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 637 $ (3,957 ) $ 709 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. For 2009 compared to 2008, the $244 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities, partially offset by lower net income. Income taxes paid, net of refunds in 2009 compared to 2008 were $3.1 billion lower on lower income before taxes and timing of payments. Changes in assets and liabilities for 2009 compared to 2008 included the following: ##TABLE_START   Inventories decreased due to lower chipset and raw materials inventory.   Accounts payable decreased due to timing of payments, despite higher production spending.   Accounts receivable increased due to higher revenue and a higher proportion of sales at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009.   Accrued compensation and benefits increased due to higher accrued profit-dependent compensation. ##TABLE_END For 2009 and 2008, our two largest customers accounted for 38% of our net revenue, with one of these customers accounting for 21% of our net revenue in 2009 (20% in 2008), and another customer accounting for 17% of our net revenue in 2009 (18% in 2008). These two largest customers accounted for 41% of our accounts receivable as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008. For 2008 compared to 2007, the $1.7 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the $1.7 billion decrease in net income, while total adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities, including net changes in assets and liabilities, were approximately flat. Effective 2008, cash flows related to marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets are included in investing activities. Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, maturities, disposals, and cash used for acquisitions. The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets, and higher cash paid for acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in investments in non-marketable equity investments. Our investments in non-marketable equity investments in 2008 included $1.0 billion for an ownership interest in Clearwire LLC. Our capital expenditures were $4.5 billion in 2009 ($5.2 billion in 2008 and $5.0 billion in 2007). Capital expenditures for 2010 are currently expected to be higher than our 2009 expenditures and are expected to be funded by cash flows from operating activities. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale debt investments. In addition, the related cash flows for marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets were included in investing activities for 2008, and previously they had been included in operating activities. Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases and retirement of common stock and the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by lower proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans. We used the majority of the proceeds from the 2009 issuance of long-term debt to repurchase and retire common stock. During 2009, we repurchased $1.8 billion of common stock compared to $7.2 billion in 2008. As of December 26, 2009, $5.7 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of $25 billion. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled $400 million in 2009 compared to $1.1 billion in 2008 as a result of a lower volume of employee exercises of stock options. Our total dividend payments in 2009 remained flat from 2008 at $3.1 billion. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 69 quarters. In January 2010, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.1575 per common share for the first quarter of 2010. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2010 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2010. The higher cash used in financing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to an increase in repurchases and retirement of common stock, and lower proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans. Liquidity Cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity. As of December 26, 2009, cash and cash equivalents, debt instruments included in trading assets, and short-term investments totaled $13.9 billion. In addition to the $13.9 billion, we have $4.5 billion in loans receivable and other long-term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio. The credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high, with credit-related other-than-temporary impairment losses on our available-for-sale debt instruments limited to less than $55 million cumulatively since the beginning of 2008. In addition, we continue to be able to invest in high-credit-quality investments. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with A/A2 or better rated issuers, and a substantial majority of the issuers are rated AA-/Aa3 or better. As of December 26, 2009, cumulative unrealized gains, net of corresponding hedging activities, related to debt instruments classified as trading assets, and cumulative unrealized gains related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale, were insignificant. As of December 27, 2008, our cumulative unrealized losses, net of corresponding hedging activities, related to debt instruments classified as trading assets were $145 million. As of December 27, 2008, our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale were $215 million. Our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2009 were $610 million, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 26, 2009. Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard  Poors and P-1 by Moodys as of December 26, 2009. We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, working capital requirements, and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions or strategic investments. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. See Note 5: Fair Value in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value on a recurring basis. When fair value is determined using observable market prices, the credit risk is incorporated into the market price of the financial instrument. When fair value is determined using pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, the issuers credit risk and/or Intels credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value, as appropriate. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Marketable Debt Instruments As of December 26, 2009, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $17.5 billion of marketable debt instruments. Of these instruments, $657 million was classified as Level 1, $15.8 billion as Level 2, and $1.1 billion as Level 3. When available, we use observable market prices for identical securities to value our marketable debt instruments. If observable market prices are not available, we use non-binding market consensus prices that we seek to corroborate with observable market data, if available, or unobservable market data. When prices from multiple sources are available for a given instrument, we use observable market quotes to price our instruments, in lieu of prices from other sources. Our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. Marketable debt instruments in this category generally include certain of our corporate bonds, government bonds, and money market fund deposits. Management judgment was required to determine the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions are met for a market to be considered active. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date of each individual instrument, including the number of days each individual instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of the issued instrument. Approximately 10% of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets. When observable market prices for identical securities are not available, we price our marketable debt instruments using non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data; quoted market prices for similar instruments; or pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers. These valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding and binding broker quotes; observable market prices for identical and/or similar securities; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and, to a lesser degree, unobservable market inputs. We corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exists. The discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs, such as LIBOR-based yield curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings. Approximately 40% of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data, and approximately 50% due to the usage of a discounted cash flow model. Marketable debt instruments classified as Level 2 generally include commercial paper, bank time deposits, municipal bonds, certain of our money market fund deposits, and a majority of corporate bonds and government bonds. Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. When observable market data is not available, we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data, if available. Marketable debt instruments in this category generally include asset-backed securities and certain of our corporate bonds. All of our investments in asset-backed securities were classified as Level 3, and substantially all of them were valued using non-binding market consensus prices that we were not able to corroborate with observable market data due to the lack of transparency in the market for asset-backed securities. Equity Securities As of December 26, 2009, our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $773 million of marketable equity securities. Of these securities, $676 million was classified as Level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date for each individual security, including the number of days each individual equity security trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding shares of that security. The remaining marketable equity securities of $97 million were classified as Level 2 because their valuations were either based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for security-specific restrictions. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 26, 2009: ##TABLE_START                      Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than (In Millions) Total 1 Year 13 Years 35 Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 349 $ 102 $ 149 $ 60 $ 38 Capital purchase obligations 1 1,836 1,760 76   Other purchase obligations and commitments 2 866 290 403 48 125 Long-term debt obligations 3 7,253 284 238 238 6,493 Other long-term liabilities 4, 5 593 230 153 97 113 Total 6 $ 10,897 $ 2,666 $ 1,019 $ 443 $ 6,769 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 26, 2009, as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. Capital purchase obligations decreased from $2.9 billion as of December 27, 2008 to $1.8 billion as of December 26, 2009, primarily due to the timing of the ramp of our latest silicon process technology.  2 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase raw materials or other goods, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include, for example, agreements to fund various projects with other companies.  3 Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments.  4 We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $193 million of long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the table above. However, long-term income taxes payable, included on our consolidated balance sheets, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non-U.S. income.  5 Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Expected contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $60 million to be made during 2010 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2010 are not practical to estimate.  6 Total generally excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities. ##TABLE_END Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services generally include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The table above also includes agreements to purchase raw materials that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment. The amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and expects to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials. For other obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the table above were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms and/or the minimum cancellation fee. We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, obligations under these agreements are not included in the table above. We estimate our obligation under these agreements as of December 26, 2009 to be approximately as follows: less than one year$364 million; one to three years$3 million; more than three yearszero. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above. These obligations include contingent funding/payment obligations and milestone-based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party. Assuming that all future milestones are met, additional required payments related to these obligations were not significant as of December 26, 2009. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relative taxing authority is not included in the table above, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest. We have a contractual obligation to purchase the output of IMFT in proportion to our investments, 49% as of December 26, 2009. We also have several agreements with Micron related to intellectual property rights, and RD funding related to NAND flash manufacturing and IMFT. The obligation to purchase our proportion of IMFTs inventory was $100 million as of December 26, 2009. See Note 11: Non-Marketable Equity Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above are estimates based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements As of December 26, 2009, with the exception of a guarantee for the repayment of $275 million in principal of the payment obligations of Numonyx under its senior credit facility, as well as accrued unpaid interest, expenses of the lenders, and penalties, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. In February 2010, we signed a definitive agreement with Micron and Numonyx under which Micron agreed to acquire Numonyx in an all-stock transaction. The senior credit facility that is supported by Intels guarantee is expected to be repaid in full following the closing of this transaction. See Note 11: Non-Marketable Equity Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk, and to a lesser extent, equity market and commodity price risk. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange Rates We generally hedge currency risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with offsetting currency forward contracts, currency options, or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in a negligible net exposure to loss. Substantially all of our revenue and a majority of our expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, certain operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, the euro, and the Israeli shekel. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts and, to a lesser extent, currency options in these hedging programs. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements (see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $40 million as of December 26, 2009 (less than $55 million as of December 27, 2008). Interest Rates We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and debt issuances. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields. To achieve this objective, the returns on our investments in debt instruments are generally based on the U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our debt issuances of approximately $205 million as of December 26, 2009 (an increase of approximately $150 million as of December 27, 2008). A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $10 million as of December 26, 2009 (an increase of approximately $15 million as of December 27, 2008). These hypothetical decreases in interest rates, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions, would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately $195 million as of December 26, 2009 and $135 million as of December 27, 2008. The fluctuations in fair value of our debt issuances and investment portfolio reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in our net investment portfolio. For further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, see Fair Value of Financial Instruments in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Equity Prices Our marketable equity investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options. To the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities; however, for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments, including warrants, we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks. For securities that we no longer consider strategic, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk. We hold derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. The gains and losses from changes in fair value of these derivatives are designed to offset the gains and losses on the related liabilities, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss. As of December 26, 2009, the fair value of our marketable equity securities and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $805 million ($362 million as of December 27, 2008). Our marketable equity securities include our investments in Clearwire Corporation and Micron, carried at a fair market value of $250 million and $148 million, respectively, as of December 26, 2009. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we analyzed the expected market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a loss of 50% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $405 million, based on the value as of December 26, 2009 (a decrease in value of approximately $220 million, based on the value as of December 27, 2008 using an assumed loss of 60%). The decrease in the assumed loss percentage from December 27, 2008 to December 26, 2009 is due to lower expected overall equity market volatility. Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets and credit markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity investments, excluding investments accounted for under the equity method, had a carrying amount of $939 million as of December 26, 2009 ($1.0 billion as of December 27, 2008). As of December 26, 2009, the carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $2.5 billion ($3.0 billion as of December 27, 2008). A substantial majority of this balance as of December 26, 2009 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment. Our flash memory market segment investments include our investment of $1.6 billion in IMFT/IMFS ($2.1 billion as of December 27, 2008) and $453 million in Numonyx ($484 million as of December 27, 2008). In February 2010, we signed a definitive agreement with Micron and Numonyx under which Micron agreed to acquire Numonyx in an all-stock transaction. The value of the Micron common stock that we would receive upon the closing of the transaction is subject to equity market risk.

INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1: Basis of Presentation We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007 were all 52-week years. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Intel Corporation and our wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. We use the equity method to account for equity investments in instances in which we own common stock or similar interests, and have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for Intel and our subsidiaries; therefore, we do not have a translation adjustment recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Customer credit balances are included in other accrued liabilities and were $293 million as of December 26, 2009 ($447 million as of December 27, 2008). We have evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were issued on February 22, 2010. Note 2: Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The accounting estimates that require our most significant, difficult, and subjective judgments include: ##TABLE_START   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments;   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets;   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions); and   the valuation of inventory. ##TABLE_END The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. Trading Assets Marketable debt instruments are designated as trading assets when the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk is hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. The gains or losses of these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments, are recorded in interest and other, net. We also designate certain floating-rate securitized financial instruments, primarily asset-backed securities purchased after December 30, 2006, as trading assets. During 2009, we sold our equity securities offsetting deferred compensation and entered into derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to these deferred compensation arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these equity securities were offset against losses or gains on the related liabilities and included in interest and other, net. See Note 8: Derivative Financial Instruments for further information on our equity market risk management programs. Available-for-Sale Investments We consider all liquid available-for-sale debt instruments with original maturities from the date of purchase of approximately three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Available-for-sale debt instruments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Available-for-sale debt instruments with remaining maturities beyond one year are classified as other long-term investments. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Investments that we designate as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except as noted in the Other-Than-Temporary Impairment section below. We determine the cost of the investment sold based on the specific identification method. Our available-for-sale investments include: ##TABLE_START   Marketable debt instruments when the interest rate and foreign currency risks are not hedged at inception of the investment or when our designation for trading assets is not met. We hold these debt instruments to generate a return commensurate with the U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR. We record the interest income and realized gains and losses on the sale of these instruments in interest and other, net.   Marketable equity securities when the investments are considered strategic in nature at the time of original classification or there are barriers to mitigating equity market risk through the sale or use of derivative instruments at the time of original classification. We acquire these equity investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. To the extent that these investments continue to have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks through hedging activities. We record the realized gains or losses on the sale or exchange of marketable equity securities in gains (losses) on other equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END Non-Marketable Equity Investments Our non-marketable equity investments are included in other long-term assets. We account for non-marketable equity investments for which we do not have control over the investee as: ##TABLE_START   Equity method investments when we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Gains (losses) on equity method investments, net may be recorded with up to a one-quarter lag.   Cost method investments when the equity method does not apply. We record the realized gains or losses on the sale of non-marketable cost method investments in gains (losses) on other equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END Other-Than-Temporary Impairment All of our available-for-sale investments and non-marketable equity investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. Investments are considered impaired when the fair value is below the investments cost basis/amortized cost. Impairments affect earnings as follows: ##TABLE_START   Marketable debt instruments when the fair value is below amortized cost and (1) we intend to sell the instrument, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument (that is, a credit loss exists). Other-than-temporary impairments are separated into amounts representing credit losses, which are recognized in earnings, and amounts related to all other factors, which are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).   Marketable equity securities based on the specific facts and circumstances present at the time of assessment, which include the consideration of general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is below cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in value in the foreseeable future. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee, which may include industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and changes in the investees credit rating. We record other-than-temporary impairment charges on marketable equity securities in gains (losses) on other equity investments, net.   Non-marketable equity investments based on our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment, and qualitative and quantitative analysis, including: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the investees revenue and earning trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects;   the technological feasibility of the investees products and technologies;   the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes;   factors related to the investees ability to remain in business, such as the investees liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and   the investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. ##TABLE_END We record other-than-temporary impairment charges in gains (losses) on equity method investments, net for non-marketable equity method investments and in gains (losses) on other equity investments, net for non-marketable cost method investments. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Derivative Financial Instruments Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk, and to a lesser extent, equity market and commodity price risk. Our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. Our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for designation as cash flow or fair value hedges. A designated hedge of the exposure to variability in the future cash flows of an asset or a liability, or of a forecasted transaction, is referred to as a cash flow hedge. A designated hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or a liability, or of an unrecognized firm commitment, is referred to as a fair value hedge. The criteria for designating a derivative as a hedge include the assessment of the instruments effectiveness in risk reduction, matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction, and the assessment of the probability that the underlying transaction will occur. For derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and within the same line item on the consolidated statements of operations as the impact of the hedged transaction. For derivatives with fair value hedge accounting designation, we recognize gains or losses from the change in fair value of these derivatives, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the underlying hedged item, in earnings. Derivatives that we designate as hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from operating activities. We recognize gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes within the line item on the consolidated statements of operations most closely associated with the economic underlying, primarily in interest and other, net. As part of our strategic investment program, we also acquire equity derivative instruments, such as warrants and equity conversion rights associated with debt instruments, that we do not designate as hedging instruments. We recognize the gains or losses from changes in fair values of these equity derivative instruments in gains (losses) on other equity investments, net. Gains and losses from derivatives not designated as hedges are classified in cash flows from operating activities. Measurement of Effectiveness ##TABLE_START   Effectiveness for forwards is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the present value of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item. For currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to capital purchases, forward points are excluded, and effectiveness is measured using spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item. For currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to operating expenditures, forward points are included and effectiveness is measured using forward rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item.   Effectiveness for currency options and equity options with hedge accounting designation is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of an option instrument representing the hedged risks in the hedged item for cash flow hedges. For cash flow and fair value hedges, time value is excluded and effectiveness is measured based on spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item.   Effectiveness for interest rate swaps and commodity swaps is generally measured by comparing the change in fair value of the hedged item with the change in fair value of the swap. ##TABLE_END If a cash flow hedge is discontinued because it is no longer probable that the original hedged transaction will occur as anticipated, the unrealized gain or loss on the related derivative is reclassified into earnings. Subsequent gains or losses on the related derivative instrument are recognized in interest and other, net in each period until the instrument matures, is terminated, is re-designated as a qualified hedge, or is sold. Ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and fair value hedges, as well as amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, are recognized in earnings in interest and other, net. For further discussion of our derivative instruments, see Note 8: Derivative Financial Instruments. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Loans Receivable We make loans to third parties that are classified within other current assets or other long-term assets. We may elect the fair value option for loans when the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk is hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. We record the gains or losses on these loans arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate, currency market fluctuations, and credit market volatility, offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments, in interest and other, net. Loans that are denominated in U.S. dollars and have a floating-rate coupon are carried at amortized cost. We measure interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method, which is based on the effective yield of the loans rather than the stated coupon rate. Inventories We compute inventory cost on a currently adjusted standard basis (which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis). Inventories at year-ends were as follows: ##TABLE_START          (In Millions) 2009 2008 Raw materials $ 437 $ 608 Work in process 1,469 1,577 Finished goods 1,029 1,559 Total inventories $ 2,935 $ 3,744 ##TABLE_END Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, net at year-ends was as follows: ##TABLE_START          (In Millions) 2009 2008 1 Land and buildings $ 16,687 $ 16,557 Machinery and equipment 28,339 28,831 Construction in progress 2,796 2,730 Total property, plant and equipment, gross 47,822 48,118 Less: accumulated depreciation (30,597 ) (30,544 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 17,225 $ 17,574 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 As adjusted due to changes to the accounting for convertible debt instruments. See Note 3: Accounting Changes. ##TABLE_END We compute depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment, 2 to 4 years; buildings, 4 to 40 years. We capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Goodwill We record goodwill when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets as of the date of acquisition. We perform a quarterly review of goodwill for indicators of impairment. During the fourth quarter of each year, we perform an impairment review for each reporting unit using a fair value approach. We do not identify manufacturing and assembly and test assets with individual reporting units because of the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets. In determining the carrying value of the reporting unit, we make an allocation of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets based on each reporting units relative percentage utilization of the manufacturing and assembly and test assets. For further discussion of goodwill, see Note 17: Goodwill. Identified Intangible Assets Intellectual property assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods of benefit, ranging from 3 to 17 years. We amortize acquisition-related developed technology based on economic benefit over the estimated useful life, ranging from 4 to 7 years. We amortize other intangible assets over periods ranging from 4 to 7 years. We amortize acquisition-related in-process research and development over the estimated useful life once the research and development efforts are completed. In the quarter following the period in which identified intangible assets become fully amortized, the fully amortized balances are removed from the gross asset and accumulated amortization amounts. We perform a quarterly review of identified intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. For further discussion of identified intangible assets, see Note 18: Identified Intangible Assets. Product Warranty The vast majority of our products are sold with a limited warranty on product quality and a limited indemnification for customers against intellectual property infringement claims related to our products. The accrual and the related expense for known issues were not significant during the periods presented. Due to product testing, the short time typically between product shipment and the detection and correction of product failures, and the historical rate of payments on indemnification claims, the accrual and related expense for estimated incurred but unidentified issues were not significant during the periods presented. Revenue Recognition We recognize net product revenue when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, transfer of title, and acceptance, if applicable, as well as fixed pricing and probable collectability. We record pricing allowances, including discounts based on contractual arrangements with customers, when we recognize revenue as a reduction to both accounts receivable and net revenue. Because of frequent sales price reductions and rapid technology obsolescence in the industry, we defer product revenue and related costs of sales from sales made to distributors under agreements allowing price protection and/or right of return until the distributors sell the merchandise. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. We record the net deferred income from product sales to distributors on our balance sheet as deferred income on shipments to distributors. We include shipping charges billed to customers in net revenue, and include the related shipping costs in cost of sales. Sales of software, primarily through our Wind River Software Group, are made through term licenses that are generally 12 months in length, or perpetual licenses. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the course of the license. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Advertising Cooperative advertising programs reimburse customers for marketing activities for certain of our products, subject to defined criteria. We accrue cooperative advertising obligations and record the costs at the same time that the related revenue is recognized. We record cooperative advertising costs as marketing, general and administrative expenses to the extent that an advertising benefit separate from the revenue transaction can be identified and the fair value of that advertising benefit received is determinable. We record any excess in cash paid over the fair value of the advertising benefit received as a reduction in revenue. Advertising costs, including direct marketing costs, recorded within marketing, general and administrative expenses were $1.39 billion in 2009 ($1.86 billion in 2008 and $1.90 billion in 2007). Employee Equity Incentive Plans We have employee equity incentive plans, which are described more fully in Note 23: Employee Equity Incentive Plans. We use the straight-line attribution method to recognize share-based compensation over the service period of the award. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock units, we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and restricted stock units with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award. Note 3: Accounting Changes In 2007, we adopted standards that required companies to accrue the cost of compensated absences for sabbatical leave over the service period. We adopted these standards through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of 2007, resulting in an additional liability of $280 million, additional deferred tax assets of $99 million, and a reduction to retained earnings of $181 million. We also adopted standards that changed the accounting for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion, see Note 27: Taxes. In the first quarter of 2008, we adopted new standards for fair value measurements for all financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The standards defined fair value, established a framework for measuring fair value, and enhanced fair value measurement disclosures. The adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, and the resulting fair values calculated after adoption were not significantly different from the fair values that would have been calculated under previous guidance. As discussed below, we adopted the fair value measurement standards for our non-financial assets and liabilities in the first quarter of 2009. For further discussion of our fair value measurements, see Note 5: Fair Value. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we adopted new standards that clarified the application of fair value in a market that is not active, and addressed application issues such as the use of internal assumptions when relevant observable data does not exist, the use of observable market information when the market is not active, and the use of market quotes when assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data. The adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In the first quarter of 2008, we adopted new standards that permitted companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value using an instrument-by-instrument election. The new standards required unrealized gains and losses to be reported in earnings for items measured using the fair value option. For further discussion, see Note 5: Fair Value. These new standards also required cash flows from purchases, sales, and maturities of trading securities to be classified based on the nature and purpose for which the securities were acquired. We assessed the nature and purpose of our trading assets and determined that our marketable debt instruments will be classified on the statement of cash flows as investing activities, as they are held with the purpose of generating returns. Activity related to equity securities offsetting deferred compensation remained classified as operating activities, as they were maintained to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risk of certain deferred compensation arrangements. These standards did not allow for retrospective application to periods prior to 2008; therefore, all trading asset activity for prior periods will continue to be presented as operating activities on the statement of cash flows. In the first quarter of 2008, amended views of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the use of the simplified method in developing estimates of the expected lives of share options became effective for us. The amendment, in part, allowed the continued use, subject to specific criteria, of the simplified method in estimating the expected lives of share options granted after December 31, 2007. We will continue to use the simplified method until we have the historical data necessary to provide reasonable estimates of expected lives. In the first quarter of 2009, we adopted new standards that changed the accounting for convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features. As of adoption, these new standards applied to our junior subordinated convertible debentures issued in 2005 (the 2005 debentures). Under the previous standards, our 2005 debentures were recognized entirely as a liability at historical value. In accordance with adopting these new standards, we retrospectively recognized both a liability and an equity component of the 2005 debentures at fair value. The liability component is recognized as the fair value of a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature at issuance. The equity component, which is the value of the conversion feature at issuance, is recognized as the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the 2005 debentures and the fair value of the liability component, after adjusting for the deferred tax impact. The 2005 debentures were issued at a coupon rate of 2.95%, which was below that of a similar instrument that did not have a conversion feature (6.45%). Therefore, the valuation of the debt component, using the income approach, resulted in a debt discount. The debt discount is reduced over the expected life of the debt, which is also the stated life of the debt. These new standards are also applicable in accounting for our convertible debt issued during 2009. See Note 20: Borrowings for further discussion. As a result of applying these new standards retrospectively to all periods presented, we recognized the following incremental effects on individual line items on the consolidated balance sheets: ##TABLE_START              December 27, 2008 Before After (In Millions) Adoption Adjustments Adoption Property, plant and equipment, net $ 17,544 $ 30 $ 17,574 Other long-term assets 1 $ 6,092 $ (273 ) $ 5,819 Long-term debt $ 1,886 $ (701 ) $ 1,185 Common stock and capital in excess of par value $ 12,944 $ 458 $ 13,402 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 Primarily related to the adjustment made to the net deferred tax asset. ##TABLE_END The adoption of these new standards did not result in a change to our prior-period consolidated statements of operations, as the interest associated with our debt issuances is capitalized and added to the cost of qualified assets. The adoption of these new standards did not result in a significant change to depreciation expense or earnings per common share for 2009. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In the first quarter of 2009, we adopted revised standards for business combinations. These revised standards generally require an entity to recognize the assets, liabilities, contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. For circumstances in which the acquisition-date fair value for a contingency cannot be determined during the measurement period and it is concluded that it is probable that an asset or liability exists as of the acquisition date and the amount can be reasonably estimated, a contingency is recognized as of the acquisition date based on the estimated amount. It further requires that acquisition-related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred, restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date, and changes in estimates for accounting of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties that occur subsequent to the measurement period be reflected in income tax expense (benefit). In addition, acquired in-process research and development is capitalized as an intangible asset. These new standards became applicable to business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of 2009. Our acquisitions completed during 2009 have been accounted for using these revised standards. See Note 15: Acquisitions. In the first quarter of 2009, we adopted new standards that specify the way in which fair value measurements should be made for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities that are not measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, and specify additional disclosures related to these fair value measurements. The adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the second quarter of 2009, we adopted new standards that provide guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities when the volume and level of activity for the asset/liability have significantly decreased. These new standards also provide guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. In addition, we are required to disclose in interim and annual periods the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and a discussion of changes in valuation techniques. The adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the second quarter of 2009, we adopted new standards for the recognition and measurement of other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities that replaced the pre-existing intent and ability indicator. These new standards specify that if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances in which (1) an entity has an intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) the entity does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security (that is, a credit loss exists). Other-than-temporary impairments are separated into amounts representing credit losses, which are recognized in earnings, and amounts related to all other factors, which are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). The adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 7: Available-for-Sale Investments for further discussion. In the third quarter of 2009, we adopted amended standards for the fair value measurement of liabilities. These amended standards clarify that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, we are required to use the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset, quoted prices for similar liabilities, or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets. If these quoted prices are not available, we are required to use another valuation technique, such as an income approach or a market approach. These amended standards became effective for us beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009 and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Note 4: Recent Accounting Standards In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new standards for the accounting for transfers of financial assets. These new standards eliminate the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity; remove the scope exception from applying the accounting standards that address the consolidation of variable interest entities to qualifying special-purpose entities; change the standards for de-recognizing financial assets; and require enhanced disclosure. These new standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2010, and are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued amended standards for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity. These amended standards eliminate a mandatory quantitative approach to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity in favor of a qualitatively focused analysis, and require an ongoing reassessment of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary. These amended standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2010 and are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are required to be adopted in the first quarter of 2011; however, early adoption is permitted. We do not expect these new standards to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards for the accounting for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements. These new standards amend the scope of pre-existing software revenue guidance by removing from the guidance non-software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products. These new standards are required to be adopted in the first quarter of 2011; however, early adoption is permitted. We do not expect these new standards to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued amended standards that require additional fair value disclosures. These amended standards require disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value as well as disclosures about significant transfers, beginning in the first quarter of 2010. Additionally, these amended standards require presentation of disaggregated activity within the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), beginning in the first quarter of 2011. We do not expect these new standards to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. Note 5: Fair Value Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value, except for equity method investments, cost method investments, cost method loans receivable, and most of our liabilities. Fair Value Hierarchy The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Assets/Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components, consisted of the following types of instruments as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008: ##TABLE_START                                  December 26, 2009 December 27, 2008 Fair Value Measured and Recorded at Fair Value Measured and Recorded at Reporting Date Using Reporting Date Using (In Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets Commercial paper $  $ 6,326 $  $ 6,326 $  $ 4,387 $  $ 4,387 Corporate bonds 579 3,894 369 4,842 152 5,987 555 6,694 Government bonds 1 17 3,549  3,566  604  604 Bank time deposits  1,582  1,582  633  633 Marketable equity securities 676 97  773 308 44  352 Asset-backed securities   754 754   1,083 1,083 Municipal bonds  390  390  383  383 Loans receivable  249  249     Derivative assets  137 31 168  158 15 173 Money market fund deposits 61 17  78 373 49  422 Equity securities offsetting deferred compensation     299   299 Total assets measured and recorded at fair value $ 1,333 $ 16,241 $ 1,154 $ 18,728 $ 1,132 $ 12,245 $ 1,653 $ 15,030 Liabilities Derivative liabilities $  $ 161 $ 65 $ 226 $  $ 274 $ 25 $ 299 Long-term debt   123 123   122 122 Total liabilities measured and recorded at fair value $  $ 161 $ 188 $ 349 $  $ 274 $ 147 $ 421 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 Includes bonds issued or deemed to be guaranteed by non-U.S. governments, Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC)-insured corporate bonds, U.S. agency securities, and U.S. Treasury securities. ##TABLE_END 63 INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The tables below present reconciliations for all assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for 2009 and 2008: ##TABLE_START                              Fair Value Measured and Recorded Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Government Corporate Asset-Backed Derivative Derivative Long-Term Total Gains (In Millions) Bonds Bonds Securities Assets Liabilities Debt (Losses) Balance as of December 27, 2008 $  $ 555 $ 1,083 $ 15 $ (25 ) $ (122 ) Total gains or losses (realized and unrealized): Included in earnings 1  4 25 (2 ) 18 (1 ) 44 Included in other comprehensive income (loss) 1 36 20    57 Purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements, net 300 279 (374 ) 18   Transfers in and/or out of Level 3 (301 ) 2 (505 ) 2   (58 )  Balance as of December 26, 2009 $  $ 369 $ 754 $ 31 $ (65 ) $ (123 ) Changes in unrealized gains or losses included in earnings related to assets and liabilities still held as of December 26, 2009 1 $  $  $ 53 $  $ 18 $ (1 ) $ 70 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 Gains and losses (realized and unrealized) included in earnings are primarily reported in interest and other, net on the consolidated statements of operations.  2 Transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 due to a greater availability of observable market data and/or non-binding market consensus prices to value or corroborate the value of these instruments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START                          Fair Value Measured and Recorded Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Corporate Asset-Backed Derivative Derivative Long-Term Total Gains (In Millions) Bonds Securities Assets Liabilities Debt (Losses) Balance as of December 29, 2007 $ 733 $ 1,840 $ 18 $ (15 ) $ (125 ) Total gains or losses (realized and unrealized): Included in earnings 1 3 (108 ) 4 (13 ) 3 (111 ) Included in other comprehensive income (loss) (26 ) (23 )    (49 ) Purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements, net 526 (626 ) (10 ) 3  Transfers in and/or out of Level 3 (681 ) 2  3   Balance as of December 27, 2008 $ 555 $ 1,083 $ 15 $ (25 ) $ (122 ) Changes in unrealized gains or losses included in earnings related to assets and liabilities still held as of December 27, 2008 1 $ 3 $ (108 ) $ 4 $ (13 ) $ 3 $ (111 ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 Gains and losses (realized and unrealized) included in earnings are primarily reported in interest and other, net on the consolidated statements of operations.  2 Transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 due to a greater availability of observable market data and/or non-binding market consensus prices to value or corroborate the value of these instruments. ##TABLE_END 64 INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Fair Value Option for Financial Assets/Liabilities Under accounting standards issued in 2008, all of our non-convertible long-term debt was eligible to be accounted for at fair value. However, we elected this fair value option only for the bonds issued in 2007 by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona (2007 Arizona bonds). In connection with the 2007 Arizona bonds, we entered into a total return swap agreement that effectively converts the fixed rate obligation on the bonds to a floating U.S.-dollar LIBOR-based rate. As a result, changes in the fair value of this debt are largely offset by changes in the fair value of the total return swap agreement, without the need to apply hedge accounting provisions. We did not elect this fair value option for our Arizona bonds issued in 2005, since the bonds were carried at amortized cost and were not eligible to apply hedge accounting provisions due to the use of non-derivative hedging instruments. The 2007 Arizona bonds are included within the long-term debt balance on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, no other instruments were similar to the long-term debt instrument for which we elected fair value treatment. The fair value of the 2007 Arizona bonds approximated carrying value at the time that we elected the fair value option; therefore, we did not record a cumulative-effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings or to the deferred tax liability. As of December 26, 2009, the fair value of the 2007 Arizona bonds did not significantly differ from the contractual principal balance. The fair value of the 2007 Arizona bonds was determined using inputs that are observable in the market or that can be derived from or corroborated with observable market data, as well as unobservable inputs that were significant to the fair value. Gains and losses on the 2007 Arizona bonds are recorded in interest and other, net on the consolidated statements of operations. We capitalize interest associated with the 2007 Arizona bonds. We add capitalized interest to the cost of qualified assets and amortize it over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We elected the fair value option for loans made in the second quarter of 2009. These loans receivable are denominated in euros and mature in 2012 and 2013. In connection with these loans receivable, we entered into a currency interest rate swap agreement that effectively converts the euro-denominated fixed-rate loans receivable to a floating U.S.-dollar LIBOR-based rate. As a result, changes in the fair value are largely offset by changes in the fair value of the currency interest rate swap agreement, without the need to apply hedge accounting provisions. We made a loan in the fourth quarter of 2009 that is denominated in U.S. dollars and has a floating-rate coupon. Since the loan matched our investment objectives, we did not enter into any derivative instruments and did not elect the fair value option for the loan. As of December 26, 2009, the fair value of our loans receivable for which we elected the fair value option did not significantly differ from the contractual principal balance. These loans receivable are classified within other long-term assets. Fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Gains and losses from changes in fair value, as well as interest income, are recorded in interest and other, net on the consolidated statements of operations. During 2009, gains from fair value changes of our loans receivable were largely offset by losses from fair value changes of the currency interest rate swap, resulting in a negligible net impact on our consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses attributable to changes in credit risk are determined using observable credit default spreads for comparable companies and were insignificant during 2009. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis The following table presents the financial instruments and non-financial assets that were measured and recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis during 2009, and the gains (losses) recorded during 2009 on those assets: ##TABLE_START                      Total Gains Net Carrying (Losses) for 12 Value as of Fair Value Measured and Recorded Using Months Ended (In Millions) Dec. 26, 2009 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Dec. 26, 2009 Non-marketable equity investments $ 208 $  $  $ 211 $ (187 ) Property, plant and equipment $ 27 $  $ 27 $  $ (16 ) Total gains (losses) for assets held as of December 26, 2009 $ (203 ) Gains (losses) for non-marketable equity investments no longer held $ (34 ) Gains (losses) for property, plant and equipment no longer held $ (136 ) Total gains (losses) for recorded non-recurring measurement $ (373 ) ##TABLE_END The following table presents the financial instruments that were measured and recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis during 2008, and the gains (losses) recorded during 2008 on those assets: ##TABLE_START                      Total Gains Net Carrying (Losses) for 12 Value as of Fair Value Measured and Recorded Using Months Ended (In Millions) Dec. 27, 2008 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Dec. 27, 2008 Clearwire Communications, LLC $ 238 $  $ 238 $  $ (762 ) Numonyx B.V. $ 484 $  $  $ 503 $ (250 ) Other non-marketable equity investments $ 84 $  $  $ 84 $ (200 ) Total gains (losses) for assets held as of December 27, 2008 $ (1,212 ) ##TABLE_END The carrying value of our impaired non-marketable equity investments may not equal our fair value measurement at the time of impairment due to the subsequent recognition of equity method adjustments. A portion of our non-marketable equity investments were measured and recorded at fair value in 2009 and 2008 due to events or circumstances that significantly impacted the fair value of those investments, resulting in other-than-temporary impairment charges. During 2008, we recorded a $762 million impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC) to write down our investment to its fair value, primarily due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment. The impairment charge was included in gains (losses) on equity method investments, net. We determine the fair value of our investment in Clearwire LLC primarily using the quoted prices for its parent company, Clearwire Corporation. The effects of adjusting the quoted price for premiums that we believe market participants would consider for Clearwire LLC, such as tax benefits and voting rights associated with our investments, were mostly offset by the effects of discounts to the fair value, such as those due to transfer restrictions, lack of liquidity, and differences in dividend rights that are included in the value of Clearwire Corporation stock. We classified our investment in Clearwire LLC as Level 2, as the unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology were not significant to the measurement of fair value.

INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) We recorded a $250 million impairment charge on our investment in Numonyx B.V. during 2008 to write down our investment to its fair value. Estimates for revenue, earnings, and future cash flows were revised lower due to a general decline in the NOR flash memory market segment in 2008. We measured the fair value of our investment in Numonyx using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach included the use of a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of Numonyx, which required the use of unobservable inputs, including assumptions of projected revenue, expenses, capital spending, and other costs, as well as a discount rate calculated based on the risk profile of the flash memory market segment comparable to our investment in Numonyx. The market approach included the use of financial metrics and ratios, such as multiples of revenue and earnings of comparable public companies. The impairment charge was included in gains (losses) on equity method investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. We also measured and recorded other non-marketable equity investments at fair value during 2009 and 2008 when we recognized other-than-temporary impairment charges. We classified these measurements as Level 3, as we used unobservable inputs to the valuation methodologies that were significant to the fair value measurements, and the valuations required management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices. We calculated these fair value measurements using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies sizes, growth rates, industries, development stages, and other relevant factors. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which requires the following significant estimates for the investee: revenue, based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share; costs; and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of market segment size, market segment share, and costs are developed by the investee and/or Intel using historical data and available market data. The valuation of these non-marketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, the investees capital structure, and differences in seniority and rights associated with the investees capital. Additionally, certain of our property, plant and equipment were measured and recorded at fair value during 2009 due to events or circumstances we identified that indicated that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping was not recoverable, resulting in other-than-temporary impairment charges. Most of these asset impairments related to manufacturing assets. Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis We measure our equity method investments, cost method investments, and cost method loans receivable at fair value quarterly; however, they are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. Our non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are measured at fair value when the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, and are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. Financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value are measured at fair value quarterly for disclosure purposes. The carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments not recorded at fair value as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 were as follows: ##TABLE_START                  2009 2008 Carrying Carrying (In Millions) Amount Fair Value Amount Fair Value Non-marketable equity investments $ 3,411 $ 5,723 $ 4,053 $ 4,391 Loans receivable $ 100 $ 100 $  $  Long-term debt $ 2,083 $ 2,314 $ 1,065 $ 1,030 ##TABLE_END The carrying amount and fair value of loans receivable exclude $249 million of loans measured and recorded at fair value as of December 26, 2009. The carrying amount and fair value of long-term debt exclude $123 million of long-term debt measured and recorded at fair value as of December 26, 2009 ($122 million as of December 27, 2008). In addition, the carrying amount and fair value of the current portion of long-term debt are included in long-term debt in the table above. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Our non-marketable equity investments include our investment in Numonyx. In February 2010, we signed a definitive agreement with Micron Technology, Inc. and Numonyx under which Micron agreed to acquire Numonyx in an all-stock transaction. The fair value of our investment in Numonyx was based on managements assessment as of December 26, 2009, and therefore the value implied by the pending sale was not included in that assessment. For further information, see Note 11: Non-Marketable Equity Investments. As of December 26, 2009, we had non-marketable equity investments in an unrealized loss position of $30 million that had a fair value of $205 million (unrealized loss position of $100 million on non-marketable equity investments with a fair value of $270 million as of December 27, 2008). The fair value of our loans receivable is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. The fair value of our long-term debt takes into consideration variables such as credit-rating changes and interest rate changes. Note 6: Trading Assets Trading assets outstanding as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 were as follows: ##TABLE_START                  2009 2008 Net Net Unrealized Unrealized (In Millions) Gains (Losses) Fair Value Gains (Losses) Fair Value Marketable debt instruments $ 47 $ 4,648 $ (96 ) $ 2,863 Equity securities offsetting deferred compensation   (41 ) 299 Total trading assets $ 47 $ 4,648 $ (137 ) $ 3,162 ##TABLE_END During 2009, we sold our equity securities offsetting deferred compensation and entered into derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to these deferred compensation arrangements. These deferred compensation liabilities were $511 million as of December 26, 2009 ($332 million as of December 27, 2008) and are included in other accrued liabilities. See Note 8: Derivative Financial Instruments for further information on our equity market risk management programs. Net losses on equity securities offsetting deferred compensation arrangements still held at the reporting date were $209 million in 2008 (gains of $28 million in 2007). Net gains on marketable debt instruments that we classified as trading assets held at the reporting date were $91 million in 2009 (losses of $132 million in 2008 and gains of $19 million in 2007). Net gains on the related derivatives were $18 million in 2009 (losses of $5 million in 2008 and $37 million in 2007).

The available-for-sale investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 27, 2008, aggregated by the length of time that individual securities had been in a continuous loss position, were as follows: ##TABLE_START                          2008 Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Gross Gross Gross Unrealized Unrealized Unrealized (In Millions) Losses Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses Fair Value Corporate bonds $ (71 ) $ 2,939 $ (68 ) $ 1,778 $ (139 ) $ 4,717 Marketable equity securities (43 ) 322   (43 ) 322 Asset-backed securities   (43 ) 312 (43 ) 312 Total $ (114 ) $ 3,261 $ (111 ) $ 2,090 $ (225 ) $ 5,351 ##TABLE_END As of December 26, 2009, a majority of our available-for-sale investments in an unrealized loss position were rated AA-/Aa3 or better. With the exception of a limited number of investments for which we have recognized other-than-temporary impairments, we have not seen significant liquidation delays, and for those that have matured we have received the full par value of our original debt investments. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale debt investments as of December 26, 2009, by contractual maturity, were as follows: ##TABLE_START          (In Millions) Cost Fair Value Due in 1 year or less $ 8,617 $ 8,619 Due in 12 years 1,887 1,892 Due in 25 years 2,150 2,178 Instruments not due at a single maturity date 1 219 201 Total $ 12,873 $ 12,890 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 Includes asset-backed securities and money market fund deposits. ##TABLE_END We sold available-for-sale investments, primarily marketable equity securities, for proceeds of $192 million in 2009 ($1.2 billion in 2008 and $1.7 billion in 2007, primarily marketable debt instruments). The gross realized gains on sales of available-for-sale investments totaled $43 million in 2009 ($38 million in 2008 and $138 million in 2007) and were primarily related to our sales of marketable equity securities. We recognized gains of $56 million on third-party merger transactions during 2009 (insignificant during 2008 and 2007). Impairment charges recognized on available-for-sale investments were $9 million in 2009 ($354 million in 2008 and insignificant in 2007). The 2008 impairment charges were primarily related to a $176 million impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire Corporation and $97 million of impairment charges on our investment in Micron. Gross realized losses on sales were $64 million during 2009 (insignificant during 2008 and 2007) and were primarily related to asset-backed securities. We had previously recognized other-than-temporary impairments totaling $34 million during 2008 and 2009 on these investments that were sold. Note 8: Derivative Financial Instruments Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and to a lesser extent, equity market risk and commodity price risk. We currently do not hold derivative instruments for the purpose of managing credit risk since we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty and generally enter into derivative transactions with high-credit-quality counterparties. For further discussion, see Note 9: Concentrations of Credit Risk. Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to currency exchange rate risk on our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable, which are generally hedged with offsetting currency forward contracts, currency options, or currency interest rate swaps. Substantially all of our revenue and a majority of our expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, certain operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, the euro, and the Israeli shekel. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. These programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. Our currency risk management programs include: ##TABLE_START   Currency derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize currency forward contracts and currency options to hedge exposures to the variability in the U.S.-dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S.-dollar-denominated cash flows. These instruments generally mature within 12 months. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and within the same line item on the consolidated statements of operations as the impact of the hedged transaction.   Currency derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize currency forward contracts, currency options, or currency interest rate swaps to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities and non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets. The maturity of these instruments generally occurs within 12 months, except for derivatives associated with certain long-term equity-related investments and our loans receivable that generally mature within five years. Changes in the U.S.-dollar-equivalent cash flows of the underlying assets and liabilities are approximately offset by the changes in fair values of the related derivatives. We record net gains or losses in the line item on the consolidated statements of operations most closely associated with the economic underlying, primarily in interest and other, net, except for equity-related gains or losses, which we primarily record in gains (losses) on other equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END 70 INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Interest Rate Risk Our primary objective for holding investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields. We generally swap the returns on our investments in fixed-rate debt instruments with remaining maturities longer than six months into U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns, unless management specifically approves otherwise. Our interest rate risk management programs include: ##TABLE_START   Interest rate derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest characteristics of debt instruments. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and within the same line item on the consolidated statements of operations as the impact of the hedged transaction.   Interest rate derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize interest rate swaps and currency interest rate swaps in economic hedging transactions, including hedges of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets. Floating interest rates on the swaps are reset on a monthly, quarterly, or semiannual basis. Changes in fair value of the debt instruments classified as trading assets are generally offset by changes in fair value of the related derivatives, both of which are recorded in interest and other, net. ##TABLE_END Equity Market Risk Our marketable investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. To the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activity. We may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments, including warrants. For securities that we no longer consider strategic, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk. Our equity market risk management program includes equity derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize equity derivatives, such as warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives. We recognize changes in the fair value of such derivatives in gains (losses) on other equity investments, net. We also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains and losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the gains and losses on the related liabilities, both of which are recorded in interest and other, net. As of December 27, 2008, we held equity securities, which were classified as trading assets, to generate returns that sought to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risk of certain deferred compensation arrangements. During 2009, we sold these securities and began utilizing derivative instruments to offset the equity market risks of these deferred compensation arrangements. The gains and losses on the derivative instruments are intended to more closely offset changes in the liabilities related to the deferred compensation arrangements than our previous method of investing in equity securities. Commodity Price Risk We operate facilities that consume commodities, and have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices, such as those for natural gas. These programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of commodity price movements. Our commodity price risk management program includes commodity derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize commodity swap contracts to hedge future cash flow exposures to the variability in commodity prices. These instruments generally mature within 12 months. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain (loss) from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and within the same line item on the consolidated statements of operations as the impact of the hedged transaction. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Volume of Derivative Activity Total gross notional amounts for outstanding derivatives (recorded at fair value) as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 were as follows: ##TABLE_START          (In Millions) 2009 2008 Currency forwards $ 5,732 $ 4,331 Embedded debt derivative 3,600 1,600 Interest rate swaps 1,698 1,209 Currency interest rate swaps 1,577 612 Total return swaps 530 125 Currency options 375  Other 130 163 Total $ 13,642 $ 8,040 ##TABLE_END The gross notional amounts for currency forwards, currency interest rate swaps, and currency options (presented by currency) as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 were as follows: ##TABLE_START          (In Millions) 2009 2008 Euro $ 3,330 $ 1,819 Japanese yen 1,764 909 Israeli shekel 707 680 British pound sterling 563 366 Chinese yuan 434 491 Malaysian ringgit 310 326 Other 576 352 Total $ 7,684 $ 4,943 ##TABLE_END We utilize a rolling hedge strategy for the majority of our currency forward contracts with cash flow hedge accounting designation that hedges exposures to the variability in the U.S.-dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S.-dollar-denominated cash flows. All of our currency forward contracts are single delivery that are settled at maturity involving one cash-payment exchange. We use interest rate swaps and currency interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate and currency exchange rate risk components for our fixed-rate debt instruments with remaining maturities longer than six months and for debt instruments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These swaps have multiple deliveries that are settled at various interest payment times involving cash payments at each interest and principal payment date, with the majority of the contracts having quarterly payments. Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features An insignificant amount of our derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features, such as provisions that require our debt to maintain an investment-grade credit rating from each of the major credit-rating agencies. As of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, we did not have any derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a significant net liability position.

For all periods presented, there was an insignificant impact on results of operations from discontinued cash flow hedges as a result of forecasted transactions that did not occur. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The effects of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 were as follows: ##TABLE_START            Location of Gains (Losses) (In Millions) Recognized in Income on Derivatives 2009 2008 Currency forwards Interest and other, net $ 37 $ 82 Interest rate swaps Interest and other, net 15 (27 ) Currency interest rate swaps Interest and other, net (7 ) 47 Total return swaps Interest and other, net 51 2 Other Interest and other, net 2 (11 ) Other Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net 17 (7 ) Total $ 115 $ 86 ##TABLE_END Note 9: Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, derivative financial instruments, loans receivable, and trade receivables. We also enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterpartys relative credit standing. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with A/A2 or better rated issuers, and a substantial majority of the issuers are rated AA-/Aa3 or better. Our investment policy requires substantially all investments with original maturities at the time of investment of up to six months to be rated at least A-1/P-1 by Standard  Poors/Moodys, and specifies a higher minimum rating for investments with longer maturities. For instance, investments with maturities of greater than three years require a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3 at the time of investment. Government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, or the absence of A rated counterparties in certain countries, result in some minor exceptions. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. The amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which a counterpartys obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of December 26, 2009, the total credit exposure to any single counterparty did not exceed $500 million. We obtain and secure available collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions, when we deem it appropriate. A substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers. We also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and retail distributors. Our two largest customers accounted for 38% of net revenue for 2009 and 2008, and 35% of net revenue for 2007. Additionally, these two largest customers accounted for 41% of our accounts receivable as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008. We believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe that credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis, and from this analysis, we establish credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices, such as obtaining some form of third-party guaranty or standby letter of credit, or obtaining credit insurance for all or a portion of the account balance if necessary. We continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures in accordance with the policies approved by our Board of Directors. We intend to continue to closely monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policies as deemed necessary.

IMFT/IMFS Micron and Intel formed IM Flash Technologies, LLC (IMFT) in January 2006 and IM Flash Singapore, LLP (IMFS) in February 2007. We established these joint ventures to manufacture NAND flash memory products for Micron and Intel. We own a 49% interest in each of these ventures. Initial production at the IMFS fabrication facility, including the purchase and installation of manufacturing equipment, remains on hold. IMFT and IMFS are each governed by a Board of Managers, with Micron and Intel initially appointing an equal number of managers to each of the boards. The number of managers appointed by each party adjusts depending on the parties ownership interests. These ventures will operate until 2016 but are subject to prior termination under certain terms and conditions. These joint ventures are variable interest entities. All costs of the joint ventures will be passed on to Micron and Intel through our purchase agreements. IMFT and IMFS are dependent upon Micron and Intel for any additional cash requirements. Our known maximum exposure to loss approximated our investment balance as of December 26, 2009, which was $1.6 billion in IMFT/IMFS ($2.1 billion as of December 27, 2008). Our investment in these ventures is classified within other long-term assets. As of December 26, 2009, except for the amount due to IMFT/IMFS for product purchases and services, we did not incur any additional liabilities in connection with our interests in these joint ventures. In addition to the potential loss of our existing investment, our actual losses could be higher, as Intel and Micron are liable for other future operating costs and/or obligations of IMFT/IMFS. In addition, future cash calls could increase our investment balance and the related exposure to loss. Finally, as we are currently committed to purchasing 49% of IMFTs production output and production-related services, we may be required to purchase products at a cost in excess of realizable value. Our portion of IMFT costs, primarily related to product purchases and start-up costs, was $735 million during 2009 ($1.1 billion during 2008 and $790 million during 2007). The amount due to IMFT for product purchases and services provided was $75 million as of December 26, 2009 and $190 million as of December 27, 2008. During 2009, $419 million was returned to Intel by IMFT, which is reflected as a return of equity method investment within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows ($298 million during 2008). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Micron and Intel are considered related parties under the accounting standards for consolidating variable interest entities. As a result, the primary beneficiary is the entity that is most closely associated with the joint ventures. To make that determination, we reviewed several factors. The most important factors were consideration of the size and nature of the joint ventures operations relative to Micron and Intel, and which party had the majority of economic exposure under the purchase agreements. Based on those factors, we have determined that we are not most closely associated with the joint ventures; therefore, we account for our interests using the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate these joint ventures. Numonyx In 2008, we divested our NOR flash memory business in exchange for a 45.1% ownership interest in Numonyx. For further discussion, see Note 16: Divestitures. Our initial ownership interest, comprising common stock and a note receivable, was recorded at $821 million. Our investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and our proportionate share of the income or loss is recognized on a one-quarter lag. During 2009, we recorded $31 million of equity method losses ($87 million in 2008) within gains (losses) on equity method investments, net. In 2008, we also recorded a $250 million impairment charge on our investment in Numonyx within gains (losses) on equity method investments, net. For further discussion, see Note 5: Fair Value. As of December 26, 2009, our investment balance in Numonyx was $453 million and is classified within other long-term assets ($484 million as of December 27, 2008). The carrying amount of our investment in Numonyx as of December 26, 2009 was $274 million below our share of the book value of the net assets of Numonyx. Most of this difference has been assigned to specific Numonyx long-lived assets, and our proportionate share of Numonyx income or loss will be adjusted to recognize this difference over the estimated remaining useful lives of those long-lived assets. Additional terms of our investment in Numonyx include: ##TABLE_START   We are leasing a facility in Israel to Numonyx for a period of up to 24 years under a fully paid, up-front operating lease. Upon completion of the divestiture, we recorded $82 million of deferred income representing the value of the prepaid operating lease. The deferred income will generally offset the related depreciation over the lease term.   We entered into supply and service agreements that involve the manufacture and the assembly and test of NOR flash memory products for Numonyx through 2008. The fair value of these agreements was $110 million and was recorded in other accrued liabilities upon completion of the transaction. This amount was recognized during 2008, primarily as a reduction of cost of sales. Subsequently, we agreed with Numonyx to continue certain supply and service agreements, and these agreements ended at the end of 2009.   We entered into a transition services agreement that involved providing certain services, such as information technology, supply chain, and finance support, to Numonyx. The reimbursement from Numonyx for these services offset the related cost of sales and operating expenses. Most of the services provided under the agreement ended during 2009.   Numonyx entered into an unsecured, four-year senior credit facility of up to $550 million, comprising a $450 million term loan and a $100 million revolving loan. Intel and STMicroelectronics N.V. have each provided the lenders with a guarantee of 50% of the payment obligations of Numonyx under the senior credit facility. A demand on our guarantee can be triggered if Numonyx is unable to meet its obligations under the credit facility. Acceleration of the obligations of Numonyx under the credit facility could be triggered by a monetary default of Numonyx or, in certain circumstances, by events affecting the creditworthiness of STMicroelectronics or Intel. The maximum amount of future undiscounted payments that we could be required to make under the guarantee is $275 million plus accrued interest, expenses of the lenders, and penalties. As of December 26, 2009, the carrying amount of the liability associated with the guarantee was $79 million, unchanged from the amount initially recorded in 2008, and is included in other accrued liabilities.   Our note receivable is subordinated to the senior credit facility and the preferential payout of Francisco Partners L.P., and will be deemed extinguished in liquidation events that generate proceeds insufficient to repay the senior credit facility and Francisco Partners preferential payout. ##TABLE_END 77 INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Subsequent to the end of 2009, in February 2010, we signed a definitive agreement with Micron and Numonyx under which Micron agreed to acquire Numonyx in an all-stock transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, Intel, STMicroelectronics, and Francisco Partners would sell their financial interest in Numonyx for 140 million shares of Micron common stock plus, under certain circumstances, up to an additional 10 million shares of Micron common stock. Clearwire LLC In 2008, we invested $1.0 billion in Clearwire LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Clearwire Corporation. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we invested an additional $50 million. Our investment in Clearwire LLC is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and our proportionate share of the income or loss is recognized on a one-quarter lag. During 2009, we recorded $27 million of equity method losses, which was net of a gain of $37 million as a result of a dilution of our ownership interest from the additional investment. Due to the one-quarter lag, we did not record equity method adjustments related to Clearwire LLC during 2008. During 2008, we recorded a $762 million impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire LLC to write down our investment to its fair value. The impairment charge was included in gains (losses) on equity method investments, net. For further discussion, see Note 5: Fair Value. As of December 26, 2009, our investment balance in Clearwire LLC was $261 million and is classified within other long-term assets ($238 million as of December 27, 2008). As of December 26, 2009, the carrying value of our investment in Clearwire LLC was $323 million below our share of the book value of the net assets of Clearwire Corporation, and a substantial majority of this difference has been assigned to Clearwire Corporation spectrum assets, a majority of which have an indefinite life. Cost Method Investments The carrying value of our non-marketable cost method investments was $939 million as of December 26, 2009 and $1.0 billion as of December 27, 2008. In 2009, we recognized impairment charges on non-marketable cost method investments of $179 million within gains (losses) on other equity investments ($135 million in 2008 and $90 million in 2007). Note 12: Gains (Losses) on Equity Method Investments, Net Gains (losses) on equity method investments, net included: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Equity method losses, net $ (131 ) $ (316 ) $ (103 ) Impairment charges (42 ) (1,077 ) (28 ) Other, net 26 13 134 Total gains (losses) on equity method investments, net $ (147 ) $ (1,380 ) $ 3 ##TABLE_END Note 13: Gains (Losses) on Other Equity Investments, Net Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net included: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Impairment charges $ (179 ) $ (455 ) $ (92 ) Gains on sales, net 55 60 204 Other, net 101 19 42 Total gains (losses) on other equity investments, net $ (23 ) $ (376 ) $ 154 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 14: Interest and Other, Net The components of interest and other, net were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 168 $ 592 $ 804 Interest expense (1 ) (8 ) (15 ) Other, net (4 ) (96 ) 4 Total interest and other, net $ 163 $ 488 $ 793 ##TABLE_END Note 15: Acquisitions Consideration for acquisitions that qualify as business combinations includes the net cash paid and the fair value of any vested share-based awards assumed. During the third quarter of 2009, we completed two acquisitions qualifying as business combinations for total consideration of $885 million (net of $59 million cash acquired). Substantially all of this amount related to the acquisition of Wind River Systems, Inc., a vendor of software for embedded devices, completed by acquiring all issued and outstanding Wind River Systems common shares. The objective of the acquisition of Wind River Systems was to enable the introduction of products for the embedded and handheld market segments, resulting in benefits for our existing operations. The combined consideration for acquisitions completed during 2009 was allocated as follows: ##TABLE_START      (In Millions) Fair value of net tangible assets acquired $ 47 Goodwill 489 Acquired developed technology 148 Other identified intangible assets 169 Share-based awards assumed 32 Total $ 885 ##TABLE_END During 2008, we completed two acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate net cash consideration of $16 million, plus certain liabilities. We allocated all of this consideration to goodwill. During 2007, we completed one acquisition qualifying as a business combination in exchange for net cash consideration of $76 million, plus assumption of certain liabilities. We allocated a substantial majority of this consideration to goodwill. During 2008 and 2007, the acquired business and related goodwill were recorded within the other operating segments category for segment reporting purposes. The completed acquisitions in 2009, 2008, and 2007 were not significant to our consolidated results of operations. Note 16: Divestitures During the first quarter of 2008, we completed the divestiture of a portion of the telecommunications-related assets of our optical platform division. Consideration for the divestiture was $85 million, including $75 million in cash and common shares of the acquiring company, with an estimated value of $10 million at the date of purchase. We entered into an agreement with the acquiring company to provide certain manufacturing and transition services for a limited time that has since been completed. During the first quarter of 2008, as a result of this divestiture, we recorded a net gain of $39 million within interest and other, net. During the second quarter of 2008, we completed the sale of the remaining portion of our optical platform division for common shares of the acquiring company with an estimated value of $27 million at the date of purchase. Overall, approximately 100 employees of our optical products business became employees of the acquiring company. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) During the second quarter of 2008, we completed the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business. We exchanged certain NOR flash memory assets and certain assets associated with our phase change memory initiatives with Numonyx for a note receivable with a contractual amount of $144 million and a 45.1% ownership interest in the form of common stock, together valued at $821 million. We retain certain rights to intellectual property included within the divestiture. Approximately 2,500 employees of our NOR flash memory business became employees of Numonyx. STMicroelectronics contributed certain assets to Numonyx for a note receivable with a contractual amount of $156 million and a 48.6% ownership interest in the form of common stock. Francisco Partners paid $150 million in cash in exchange for the remaining 6.3% ownership interest in the form of preferred stock and a note receivable with a contractual amount of $20 million. In addition, they received a payout right that is preferential relative to the investments of Intel and STMicroelectronics. We did not incur a gain or loss upon completion of the transaction in the second quarter of 2008, as we had recorded asset impairment charges in quarters prior to deal closure. For further discussion, see Note 19: Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. Subsequent to the divestiture, in the third quarter of 2008 we recorded a $250 million impairment charge on our investment in Numonyx within gains (losses) on equity method investments. In February 2010, we signed a definitive agreement with Micron and Numonyx under which Micron agreed to acquire Numonyx in an all-stock transaction. For further information, see Note 11: Non-Marketable Equity Investments. Note 17: Goodwill At the end of 2009, we reorganized our business to better align our major product groups around the core competencies of Intel architecture and our manufacturing operations. See Note 29: Operating Segment and Geographic Information for further discussion. Due to this reorganization, goodwill was allocated from our prior operating segments to our new operating segments, as shown below under Transfers. The allocation was based on the fair value of each business group within its original operating segment relative to the fair value of that operating segment. Goodwill activity for the years ended December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 was as follows: ##TABLE_START                              Other Intel Digital Architecture Other Enterprise Mobility PC Client Data Center Operating Operating (In Millions) Group Group Group Group Segments Segments Total Goodwill, net December 29, 2007 $ 3,385 $ 248 $  $  $  $ 283 $ 3,916 Additions due to business combinations 9     9 18 Transfers 123     (123 )  Other (2 )      (2 ) December 27, 2008 $ 3,515 $ 248 $  $  $  $ 169 $ 3,932 Additions due to business combinations 192 142    155 489 Transfers (3,707 ) (390 ) 2,220 1,459 507 (89 )  December 26, 2009 $  $  $ 2,220 $ 1,459 $ 507 $ 235 $ 4,421 ##TABLE_END During 2009, prior to our reorganization, we completed two acquisitions, including the acquisition of Wind River Systems (see Note 15: Acquisitions for further discussion). Goodwill recognized from the Wind River Systems acquisition was assigned to our Digital Enterprise Group, our Mobility Group, our Digital Home Group, and our Wind River Software Group based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition. The assignment of goodwill to our Digital Enterprise Group, our Mobility Group, and our Digital Home Group was based on the proportionate benefits expected to be generated for each group resulting from enhanced market presence for existing businesses. During 2008, we completed two acquisitions that resulted in goodwill of $18 million. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) After completing our annual impairment reviews during the fourth quarter of 2009, 2008, and 2007, we concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any year. As of December 26, 2009, accumulated impairment losses in total were $713 million: $355 million associated with our PC Client Group, $279 million associated with our Data Center Group, and $79 million associated with other Intel architecture operating segments. Note 18: Identified Intangible Assets We classify identified intangible assets within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Identified intangible assets consisted of the following as of December 26, 2009: ##TABLE_START              Accumulated (In Millions) Gross Assets Amortization Net Intellectual property assets $ 1,190 $ (616 ) $ 574 Acquisition-related developed technology 166 (34 ) 132 Other intangible assets 509 (332 ) 177 Total identified intangible assets $ 1,865 $ (982 ) $ 883 ##TABLE_END During 2009, we acquired intellectual property assets for $99 million with a weighted average life of six years. During 2009, as a result of our acquisition of Wind River Systems, we recorded acquisition-related developed technology for $148 million with a weighted average life of four years, and additions to other intangible assets of $169 million with a weighted average life of seven years. The substantial majority of other intangible assets recorded were associated with customer relationships and the Wind River Systems trade name. The remaining amount of other intangible assets was related to acquired in-process research and development. Identified intangible assets consisted of the following as of December 27, 2008: ##TABLE_START              Accumulated (In Millions) Gross Assets Amortization Net Intellectual property assets $ 1,206 $ (582 ) $ 624 Acquisition-related developed technology 22 (8 ) 14 Other intangible assets 340 (203 ) 137 Total identified intangible assets $ 1,568 $ (793 ) $ 775 ##TABLE_END During 2008, we acquired intellectual property assets for $68 million with a weighted average life of 10 years. We recorded the amortization of identified intangible assets on the consolidated statements of operations as cost of sales, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, or a reduction of revenue. Amortization expenses for the three years ended December 26, 2009 were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Intellectual property assets $ 149 $ 164 $ 159 Acquisition-related developed technology $ 30 $ 5 $ 1 Other intangible assets $ 129 $ 87 $ 92 ##TABLE_END Based on identified intangible assets recorded as of December 26, 2009, and assuming that the underlying assets will not be impaired in the future, we expect amortization expenses for each period to be as follows: ##TABLE_START                      (In Millions) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Intellectual property assets $ 147 $ 95 $ 84 $ 67 $ 56 Acquisition-related developed technology $ 54 $ 45 $ 24 $ 9 $  Other intangible assets $ 26 $ 21 $ 24 $ 23 $ 20 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 19: Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges The following table summarizes restructuring and asset impairment charges by plan for the three years ended December 26, 2009: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009 restructuring program $ 215 $  $  2008 NAND plan  215  2006 efficiency program 16 495 516 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 231 $ 710 $ 516 ##TABLE_END 2009 Restructuring Program In the first quarter of 2009, management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing and assembly and test operations. These plans included closing two assembly and test facilities in Malaysia, one facility in the Philippines, and one facility in China; stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Oregon; and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in California. We do not expect significant future charges related to the 2009 plan. The following table summarizes charges for the 2009 restructuring plan during 2009: ##TABLE_START      (In Millions) 2009 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $ 208 Asset impairments 7 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 215 ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2009 restructuring plan during 2009: ##TABLE_START              Employee Severance Asset (In Millions) and Benefits Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2008 $  $  $  Additional accruals 223 7 230 Adjustments (15 )  (15 ) Cash payments (182 )  (182 ) Non-cash settlements  (7 ) (7 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2009 $ 26 $  $ 26 ##TABLE_END We recorded the additional accruals, net of adjustments, as restructuring and asset impairment charges. The remaining accrual as of December 26, 2009 was related to severance benefits that are recorded within accrued compensation and benefits. The charges above include $208 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for 6,500 employees. 2008 NAND Plan In the fourth quarter of 2008, management approved a plan with Micron to discontinue the supply of NAND flash memory from the 200mm facility within the IMFT manufacturing network. The agreement resulted in a $215 million restructuring charge, primarily related to the IMFT 200mm supply agreement. The restructuring charge resulted in a reduction of our investment in IMFT/IMFS of $184 million, a cash payment to Micron of $24 million, and other cash payments of $7 million. The 2008 NAND plan was completed at the end of 2008. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2006 Efficiency Program In the third quarter of 2006, management approved several actions as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results. The following table summarizes charges for the 2006 efficiency program for the three years ended December 26, 2009: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $ 8 $ 151 $ 289 Asset impairments 8 344 227 Total $ 16 $ 495 $ 516 ##TABLE_END During 2006, as part of our assessment of our worldwide manufacturing capacity operations, we placed for sale our fabrication facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. As a result of placing the facility for sale, in 2006 we recorded a $214 million impairment charge to write down to fair value the land, building, and equipment. We incurred $54 million in additional asset impairment charges as a result of market conditions related to the Colorado Springs facility during 2007 and additional charges in 2008. We sold the Colorado Springs facility in 2009. In addition, during 2007 we recorded land and building write-downs related to certain facilities in Santa Clara, California. We also incurred $85 million in asset impairment charges related to assets that we sold in conjunction with the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business in 2007 and an additional $275 million in 2008. We determined the impairment charges based on the fair value, less selling costs, that we expected to receive upon completion of the divestiture in 2007 and determined the impairment charges based on the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable that we received upon completion of the divestiture, less selling costs, in 2008. For further information on this divestiture, see Note 16: Divestitures. The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2006 efficiency program during 2008 and 2009: ##TABLE_START              Employee Severance Asset (In Millions) and Benefits Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 29, 2007 $ 127 $  $ 127 Additional accruals 167 344 511 Adjustments (16 )  (16 ) Cash payments (221 )  (221 ) Non-cash settlements  (344 ) (344 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2008 $ 57 $  $ 57 Additional accruals 18 8 26 Adjustments (10 )  (10 ) Cash payments (65 )  (65 ) Non-cash settlements  (8 ) (8 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2009 $  $  $  ##TABLE_END We recorded the additional accruals, net of adjustments, as restructuring and asset impairment charges. The 2006 efficiency plan is complete. From the third quarter of 2006 through 2009, we incurred a total of $1.6 billion in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this program. These charges included a total of $686 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for 11,300 employees, and $896 million in asset impairment charges. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 20: Borrowings Short-Term Debt Short-term debt included the current portion of long-term debt of $157 million and drafts payable of $15 million as of December 26, 2009 (drafts payable of $100 million and the current portion of long-term debt of $2 million as of December 27, 2008). We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2009 were $610 million. We did not have outstanding commercial paper as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2008 were $1.3 billion. Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard  Poors and P-1 by Moodys as of December 26, 2009. Long-Term Debt Our long-term debt as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 was as follows: ##TABLE_START          (In Millions) 2009 2008 1 2009 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2039 at 3.25% $ 1,030 $  2005 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2035 at 2.95% 896 886 2005 Arizona bonds due 2035 at 4.375% 157 158 2007 Arizona bonds due 2037 at 5.3% 123 122 Other debt  21 2,206 1,187 Less: current portion of long-term debt (157 ) (2 ) Total long-term debt $ 2,049 $ 1,185 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 As adjusted due to changes to the accounting for convertible debt instruments. See Note 3: Accounting Changes. ##TABLE_END Convertible Debentures In 2005, we issued $1.6 billion of junior subordinated convertible debentures (the 2005 debentures) due in 2035. In 2009, we issued $2.0 billion of junior subordinated convertible debentures (the 2009 debentures) due in 2039. Both the 2005 and 2009 debentures pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually. We capitalized all interest associated with these debentures during the periods presented. ##TABLE_START          2005 Debentures 2009 Debentures  Coupon interest rate 2.95 % 3.25 % Effective interest rate 1 6.45 % 7.20 % Maximum amount of contingent interest that will accrue per year 2 0.40 % 0.50 % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 The effective rate is based on the rate for a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature.  2 Both the 2005 and 2009 debentures have a contingent interest component that will require us to pay interest based on certain thresholds and for certain events commencing on December 15, 2010 and August 1, 2019, for the 2005 and 2009 debentures, respectively, as outlined in the indentures governing the 2005 and 2009 debentures. The fair value of the related embedded derivative was $24 million and $15 million as of December 26, 2009 for the 2005 and 2009 debentures, respectively ($36 million as of December 27, 2008 for the 2005 debentures). ##TABLE_END 84 INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Both the 2005 and 2009 debentures are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into shares of our common stock. Holders can surrender the 2005 debentures for conversion at any time. Holders can surrender the 2009 debentures for conversion if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter. We can settle any conversion or repurchase of the 2005 debentures in cash or stock at our option. However, we will settle any conversion or repurchase of the 2009 debentures in cash up to the face value, and any amount in excess of face value will be settled in cash or stock at our option. On or after December 15, 2012, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2005 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the date on which we provide notice of redemption. On or after August 5, 2019, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2009 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the date on which we provide notice of redemption. If certain events occur in the future, the indentures governing the 2005 and 2009 debentures provide that each holder of the debentures can, for a pre-defined period of time, require us to repurchase the holders debentures for the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Both the 2005 and 2009 debentures are subordinated in right of payment to our existing and future senior debt and to the other liabilities of our subsidiaries. We have concluded that both the 2005 and 2009 debentures are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded stock conversion options qualify as derivatives. In addition, we have concluded that the embedded conversion options would be classified in stockholders equity if they were freestanding derivative instruments. As such, the embedded conversion options are not accounted for separately as derivatives. ##TABLE_START              2005 Debentures 2009 Debentures Dec. 26, Dec. 27, Dec. 26, (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 2009 2008 2009  Outstanding principal $ 1,600 $ 1,600 $ 2,000 Equity component carrying amount $ 466 $ 466 $ 613 Unamortized discount 1 $ 691 $ 701 $ 953 Net debt carrying amount $ 896 $ 886 $ 1,030 Conversion rate (shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures) 2 32.12 31.72 44.09 Effective conversion price (per share of common stock) $ 31.14 $ 31.53 $ 22.68 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 The remaining amortization periods for the 2005 and 2009 debentures are approximately 26 and 30 years, respectively, as of December 26, 2009.  2 The conversion rate adjusts for certain events outlined in the indentures governing the 2005 and 2009 debentures, such as quarterly dividend distributions in excess of $0.10 and $0.14 per share, for the 2005 and 2009 debentures, respectively, but does not adjust for accrued interest. In addition, the conversion rate will increase for a holder of either the 2005 or 2009 debentures who elects to convert the debentures in connection with certain share exchanges, mergers, or consolidations involving Intel, as described in the indentures governing the 2005 and 2009 debentures. ##TABLE_END Arizona Bonds In 2005, we guaranteed repayment of principal and interest on bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona, which constitutes an unsecured general obligation for Intel. The principal amount, excluding the premium, of the bonds issued in 2005 (2005 Arizona bonds) was $157 million. The bonds are due in 2035 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.375% until 2010. The 2005 Arizona bonds are subject to mandatory tender on November 30, 2010, at which time we can re-market the bonds as either fixed-rate bonds for a specified period or as variable-rate bonds until their final maturity on December 1, 2035. As such, the 2005 Arizona bonds were classified as short-term debt as of December 26, 2009. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In 2007, we guaranteed repayment of principal and interest on bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona, which constitute an unsecured general obligation for Intel. The aggregate principal amount of the bonds issued in December 2007 (2007 Arizona bonds) is $125 million due in 2037, and the bonds bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.3%. The 2007 Arizona bonds are subject to mandatory tender, at our option, on any interest payment date beginning on or after December 1, 2012 until their final maturity on December 1, 2037. Upon such tender, we can re-market the bonds as either fixed-rate bonds for a specified period or as variable-rate bonds until their final maturity. We also entered into a total return swap agreement that effectively converts the fixed-rate obligation on the bonds to a floating U.S.-dollar LIBOR-based rate. At the beginning of the first quarter of 2008, we elected to account for the 2007 Arizona bonds at fair value. For further discussion, see Note 5: Fair Value. As of December 26, 2009, our aggregate debt maturities based on outstanding principal were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START      Year Payable $ 157 2011  2012  2013  2014  2015 and thereafter 3,725 Total $ 3,882 ##TABLE_END Substantially all of the difference between the total aggregate debt maturities above and the total carrying amount of our debt is due to the equity component of our convertible debentures. Note 21: Retirement Benefit Plans Profit Sharing Plans We provide tax-qualified profit sharing retirement plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. and certain other countries. The plans, which are funded by annual discretionary contributions by Intel, are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) determines the amounts to be contributed to the U.S. Profit Sharing Plan under delegation of authority from our Board of Directors, pursuant to the terms of the Profit Sharing Plan. As of December 26, 2009, 51% of our U.S. Profit Sharing Fund was invested in equities, and 49% was invested in fixed-income instruments. Most assets are managed by external investment managers. For the benefit of eligible U.S. employees, we also provide a non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees. This plan is designed to permit certain discretionary employer contributions and to permit employee deferral of a portion of compensation in excess of certain tax limits. This plan is unfunded. We expensed $260 million for the qualified and non-qualified U.S. profit sharing retirement plans in 2009 ($289 million in 2008 and $302 million in 2007). In the first quarter of 2010, we funded $265 million for the 2009 contribution to the qualified U.S. Profit Sharing Plan. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans U.S. Pension Benefits. We provide a tax-qualified defined-benefit pension plan for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. The plan provides for a minimum pension benefit that is determined by a participants years of service and final average compensation (taking into account the participants social security wage base), reduced by the participants balance in the U.S. Profit Sharing Plan. If we do not continue to contribute to, or significantly reduce contributions to, the U.S. Profit Sharing Plan, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. defined-benefit plan could increase significantly. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Non-U.S. Pension Benefits. We also provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain other countries. Consistent with the requirements of local law, we deposit funds for certain plans with insurance companies, with third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts, and/or accrue for the unfunded portion of the obligation. The assumptions used in calculating the obligation for the non-U.S. plans depend on the local economic environment. Postretirement Medical Benefits. Upon retirement, eligible U.S. employees are credited with a defined dollar amount based on years of service. These credits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase coverage in an Intel-sponsored medical plan. If the available credits are not sufficient to pay the entire cost of the coverage, the remaining cost is the responsibility of the retiree. Funding Policy. Our practice is to fund the various pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of U.S. federal laws and regulations or applicable local laws and regulations. Additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate. Depending on the design of the plan, local customs, and market circumstances, the liabilities of a plan may exceed qualified plan assets. Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets The changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets for the plans described above were as follows: ##TABLE_START                          U.S. Pension Non-U.S. Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits Medical Benefits (In Millions) 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 Change in projected benefit obligation: Beginning benefit obligation $ 542 $ 291 $ 691 $ 794 $ 173 $ 213 Service cost 12 14 47 64 12 12 Interest cost 35 16 37 42 11 12 Plan participants contributions   9 10 4 3 Actuarial (gain) loss (10 ) 244 (74 ) (157 ) 6 (60 ) Currency exchange rate changes   4 13   Plan amendments   (19 )    Plan curtailments 1   (7 ) (20 )   Plan settlements 1   (16 ) (27 )   Benefits paid to plan participants (12 ) (23 ) (19 ) (28 ) (6 ) (7 ) Ending projected benefit obligation $ 567 $ 542 $ 653 $ 691 $ 200 $ 173 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START                          U.S. Pension Non-U.S. Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits Medical Benefits (In Millions) 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 Change in plan assets: Beginning fair value of plan assets $ 303 $ 227 $ 457 $ 548 $ 1 $ 1 Actual return on plan assets 20 (6 ) 58 (132 ) (1 ) (1 ) Employer contributions 100 105 54 80 4 5 Plan participants contributions   9 10 4 3 Currency exchange rate changes   3 22   Plan settlements 1   (10 ) (43 )   Benefits paid to plan participants (12 ) (23 ) (19 ) (28 ) (6 ) (7 ) Ending fair value of plan assets $ 411 $ 303 $ 552 $ 457 $ 2 $ 1 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 2008 curtailments and settlements were primarily related to the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business for employees at our Israel and Philippines facilities. ##TABLE_END 87 INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following table summarizes the amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008: ##TABLE_START                          U.S. Pension Non-U.S. Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits Medical Benefits (In Millions) 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 Other long-term assets $  $  $ 85 $ 39 $  $  Accrued compensation and benefits   (5 ) (4 ) (4 ) (4 ) Other long-term liabilities (156 ) (239 ) (181 ) (269 ) (194 ) (168 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (income) 268 307 21 167 (42 ) (49 ) Net amount recognized $ 112 $ 68 $ (80 ) $ (67 ) $ (240 ) $ (221 ) ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the amounts recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) before taxes, as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008: ##TABLE_START                          U.S. Pension Non-U.S. Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits Medical Benefits (In Millions) 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 Net prior service cost $  $  $ 16 $  $ (12 ) $ (16 ) Net actuarial gain (loss) (268 ) (307 ) (36 ) (165 ) 54 65 Reclassification adjustment of transition obligation   (1 ) (2 )   Defined benefit plans, net $ (268 ) $ (307 ) $ (21 ) $ (167 ) $ 42 $ 49 ##TABLE_END As of December 26, 2009, the accumulated benefit obligation was $270 million for the U.S. defined-benefit pension plan ($251 million as of December 27, 2008) and $511 million for the non-U.S. defined-benefit pension plans ($556 million as of December 27, 2008). Included in the aggregate data in the following tables are the amounts applicable to our pension plans, with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, as well as plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. Amounts related to such plans were as follows: ##TABLE_START                  U.S. Pension Non-U.S. Pension Benefits Benefits (In Millions) 2009 2008 2009 2008  Plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets: Accumulated benefit obligations $  $  $ 198 $ 447 Plan assets $  $  $ 68 $ 255 Plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets: Projected benefit obligations $ 567 $ 542 $ 258 $ 531 Plan assets $ 411 $ 303 $ 70 $ 258 ##TABLE_END Assumptions Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans were as follows: ##TABLE_START                          U.S. Pension Non-U.S. Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits Medical Benefits 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008  Discount rate 6.1 % 6.7 % 5.7 % 5.6 % 6.3 % 6.8 % Rate of compensation increase 5.1 % 5.0 % 3.6 % 3.5 % n/a n/a ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine costs for the plans were as follows: ##TABLE_START                                      Non-U.S. Pension Postretirement U.S. Pension Benefits Benefits Medical Benefits 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007  Discount rate 6.7 % 5.6 % 5.5 % 5.5 % 5.2 % 5.2 % 6.8 % 5.6 % 5.5 % Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 4.5 % 5.1 % 5.6 % 6.7 % 6.5 % 6.2 % n/a n/a n/a Rate of compensation increase 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.0 % 3.4 % 4.3 % 4.5 % n/a n/a n/a ##TABLE_END For the U.S. plans, we developed the discount rate by calculating the benefit payment streams by year to determine when benefit payments will be due. We then matched the benefit payment streams by year to the AA corporate bond rates to match the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments and discounted back to the measurement date to determine the appropriate discount rate. For the non-U.S. plans, we used two approaches to develop the discount rate. In certain countries, we used a model consisting of a theoretical bond portfolio for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximated the estimated benefit payments of our pension plans. In other countries, we analyzed current market long-term bond rates and matched the bond maturity with the average duration of the pension liabilities. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions take into consideration both duration and risk of the investment portfolios, and are developed through consensus and building-block methodologies. The consensus methodology includes unadjusted estimates by the fund manager on future market expectations by broad asset classes and geography. The building-block approach determines the rates of return implied by historical risk premiums across asset classes. In addition, we analyzed rates of return relevant to the country where each plan is in effect and the investments applicable to the plan, expectations of future returns, local actuarial projections, and the projected long-term rates of return from external investment managers. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets shown for the non-U.S. plan assets is weighted to reflect each countrys relative portion of the non-U.S. plan assets. Net Periodic Benefit Cost The net periodic benefit cost for the plans included the following components: ##TABLE_START                                      Non-U.S. Pension Postretirement U.S. Pension Benefits Benefits Medical Benefits (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Service cost $ 12 $ 14 $ 18 $ 47 $ 64 $ 70 $ 12 $ 12 $ 6 Interest cost 35 16 17 37 42 37 11 12 11 Expected return on plan assets (13 ) (11 ) (10 ) (31 ) (39 ) (29 )    Amortization of prior service cost   (25 ) (4 )  1 4 4 4 Amortization of transition obligation    1      Recognized net actuarial loss (gain) 22 1 7 8 6 11 (4 )   Recognized curtailment gains 1    (6 ) (4 )     Recognized settlement losses 1    6 17     Net periodic benefit cost $ 56 $ 20 $ 7 $ 58 $ 86 $ 90 $ 23 $ 28 $ 21 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 2008 curtailments and settlements were primarily related to the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business for employees at our Israel and Philippines facilities. ##TABLE_END 89 INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Fair Value of Plan Assets Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value of plan assets are as follows: Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data. Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets. U.S. Pension Plan Assets In general, the investment strategy for U.S. pension plan assets is to maximize risk-adjusted returns, taking into consideration the investment horizon and expected volatility, to ensure that there are sufficient assets available to pay pension benefits as they come due. When deemed appropriate, we may invest a portion of the funds in futures contracts for the purpose of acting as a temporary substitute for an investment in a particular equity security. The fund does not engage in speculative futures transactions. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 80% to 90% for fixed-income debt instrument investments and 10% to 20% for domestic and international equity fund investments. The fixed-income debt instrument portion is invested largely in common collective trust funds that invest in one- to three-year U.S. government bonds and investment-grade credit, and to a lesser extent, in non-U.S., asset-backed, and non-investment-grade debt. The expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. pension plan assets is 4.5%. U.S. pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following investment categories as of December 26, 2009: ##TABLE_START                  Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using (In Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Equity securities: U.S. Large Cap Stock Fund $  $ 25 $  $ 25 U.S. Small Cap Stock Fund  7  7 International Stock Fund  31  31 Fixed income: U.S. Treasuries 1  182  182 U.S. corporate bonds  65  65 Global Bond FundCommon Collective Trusts 2  53  53 Global Bond FundOther 2 15 33  48 Total U.S. pension plan assets at fair value $ 15 $ 396 $  $ 411 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 This category represents two common collective trust funds that seek to replicate the performance of the Barclays Capital 1  3 Year Treasury Bond Index and Barclays Capital 1  3 Year Agency Bond Index over the long term.  2 The funds target allocation is approximately 50% of assets in government and high-quality corporate bonds and asset-backed securities to mitigate risks related to deflation, 10% in global inflation-indexed bonds to provide protection from inflation, and another 10% in international government and corporate bonds. The residual 30% of the fund is allocated to other fixed-income investments, which may include exposures to the aforementioned sectors as well as emerging markets, high-yield investments, and mortgage-backed securities. ##TABLE_END 90 INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Non-U.S. Plan Assets The investments of the non-U.S. plans are managed by insurance companies, third-party trustees, or pension funds, consistent with regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within the guidelines set by us or local regulations. The investment manager evaluates performance by comparing the actual rate of return to the return on other similar assets. Investments managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under standard contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we have discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equities and fixed-income debt instruments, either through index funds or direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or individual securities in order to reduce market risk and assure that the pension assets are available to pay benefits as they come due. The average expected long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plan assets is 6.1%. Non-U.S. plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following investment categories as of December 26, 2009: ##TABLE_START                  Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using (In Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Equity securities: Global equities 1 $ 149 $ 60 $  $ 209 Real estate  7 14 21 Non-U.S. venture capital   2 2 Fixed income: Non-U.S. government bonds  116  116 Investments held by insurance companies 2  167  167 Insurance contracts 2   25 25 Total assets measured at fair value $ 149 $ 350 $ 41 $ 540 Cash 12 Total non-U.S. plan assets at fair value $ 552 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 The majority of the assets in this category are invested in a diversified mix of equities of developed countries, including the U.S., and emerging markets throughout the world.  2 Investment assets managed by qualified insurance companies are invested as part of the insurance companies general fund. We do not have control over the target allocation or visibility of the investment strategies of these investments. Insurance contracts and investments held by insurance companies made up 35% of total non-U.S. plan assets as of December 26, 2009 (36% as of December 27, 2008). ##TABLE_END The table below presents a reconciliation for the non-U.S. plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for 2009: ##TABLE_START              Non-U.S. Venture Insurance (In Millions) Real Estate Capital Contracts Balance as of December 27, 2008 $ 16 $ 4 $ 23 Realized and unrealized return on plan assets (4 ) (2 ) 1 Purchases, sales, and settlements, net 2  1 Balance as of December 26, 2009 $ 14 $ 2 $ 25 ##TABLE_END The target allocation of the non-U.S. plan assets that we have control over is 65% equity securities and 35% fixed-income instruments. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Concentration of Risk We manage a variety of risks, including market, credit, and liquidity risks, across our plan assets through our investment managers. We define a concentration of risk as an undiversified exposure to one of the above-mentioned risks that increases the exposure of the loss of plan assets unnecessarily. We monitor exposure to such risks in both the U.S. and non-U.S. plans by monitoring the magnitude of the risk in each plan and diversifying our exposure to such risks across a variety of instruments, markets, and counterparties. As of December 26, 2009, we did not have concentrations of risk in any single entity, manager, counterparty, sector, industry, or country. Funding Expectations Under applicable law for the U.S. Pension Plan, we are not required to make any contributions during 2010. Our expected funding for the non-U.S. plans during 2010 is approximately $55 million. We expect employer contributions to the postretirement medical benefits plan to be approximately $5 million during 2010. Estimated Future Benefit Payments We expect the benefits to be paid through 2019 from the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to be on average approximately $75 million annually. Note 22: Commitments A portion of our capital equipment and certain facilities are under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2028. Additionally, portions of our land are under leases that expire at various dates through 2062. Rental expense was $120 million in 2009 ($141 million in 2008 and $154 million in 2007). Minimum rental commitments under all non-cancelable leases with an initial term in excess of one year were as follows as of December 26, 2009 (in millions): ##TABLE_START      Year Payable $ 102 2011 83 2012 66 2013 40 2014 20 2015 and thereafter 38 Total $ 349 ##TABLE_END Commitments for construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment totaled $1.8 billion as of December 26, 2009 ($2.9 billion as of December 27, 2008), substantially all of which will be due within the next year. Other purchase obligations and commitments totaled approximately $900 million as of December 26, 2009 ($1.2 billion as of December 27, 2008). Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses, agreements to purchase raw materials or other goods, and payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include, for example, agreements to fund various projects with other companies. In addition, we have various contractual commitments with Micron and IMFT/IMFS. For further information on these contractual commitments, see Note 11: Non-Marketable Equity Investments. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 23: Employee Equity Incentive Plans Our equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term retention programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. In May 2009, stockholders approved an extension of the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan). Stockholders approved 134 million additional shares for issuance, increasing the total shares of common stock available for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors to 428 million shares. The approval also extended the expiration date of the 2006 Plan to June 2012. The maximum number of shares to be awarded as non-vested shares (restricted stock) or non-vested share units (restricted stock units) increased to 253 million shares. As of December 26, 2009, 226 million shares remained available for future grant under the 2006 Plan. We may assume the equity incentive plans and the outstanding equity awards of certain acquired companies. Once they are assumed, we do not grant additional shares under these plans. Also in May 2009, stockholders approved an employee stock option exchange program (Option Exchange) to give employees (not listed officers) the opportunity to exchange eligible stock options for a lesser number of new stock options that have approximately the same fair value as the options surrendered, as of the date of the exchange. The Option Exchange commenced on September 28, 2009 and expired on October 30, 2009. Eligible options included stock options granted under any Intel stock option or equity incentive plan between October 1, 2000 and September 28, 2008 that had an exercise price above $20.83, which was the 52-week closing-price high as of October 30, 2009. A total of 217 million eligible stock options were tendered and cancelled in exchange for 83 million new stock options granted. The new stock options have an exercise price of $19.04, which is equal to the market price of Intel common stock (defined as the average of the high and low trading prices) on October 30, 2009. The new stock options were issued under the 2006 Plan and are subject to its terms and conditions. The new stock options vest in equal annual increments over a four-year period from the date of grant and will expire seven years from the grant date. Using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, we determined that the fair value of the surrendered stock options on a grant-by-grant basis was approximately equal, as of the date of the exchange, to the fair value of the eligible stock options exchanged, resulting in insignificant incremental share-based compensation. In 2009, we began issuing restricted stock units with both a market condition and a service condition (market-based restricted stock units), which were referred to in our 2009 Proxy Statement as outperformance stock units, to a small group of senior officers and non-employee directors. The number of shares of Intel common stock to be received at vesting will range from 33% to 200% of the target amount, based on total stockholder return (TSR) on Intel common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of a peer group over a three-year period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. As of December 26, 2009, there were 2 million market-based restricted stock units outstanding. These market-based restricted stock units accrue dividend equivalents and vest three years and one month from the grant date. In connection with our completed acquisition of Wind River Systems, we assumed their equity incentive plans and issued replacement awards in the third quarter of 2009. The stock options and restricted stock units issued generally retain the terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted. We will not grant additional shares under these plans. Equity awards granted to employees in 2009 under our equity incentive plans generally vest over 4 years from the date of grant, and options expire 7 years from the date of grant with the exception of market-based restricted stock units and replacement awards related to acquisitions. Equity awards granted to key officers, senior-level employees, and key employees in 2009 may have delayed vesting beginning 3 to 5 years from the date of grant, and options expire 7 to 10 years from the date of grant. The 2006 Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific dates. Under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan, we made 240 million shares of common stock available for issuance through August 2011. As of December 26, 2009, 157 million shares were available for issuance under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation recognized in 2009 was $889 million ($851 million in 2008 and $952 million in 2007). We adjust share-based compensation on a quarterly basis for changes to our estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on our review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. We recognize the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all expense amortization after January 1, 2006 in the period that we change the forfeiture estimate. The effect of forfeiture adjustments in 2007, 2008, and 2009 was not significant. The total share-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory as of December 26, 2009 was $33 million ($46 million as of December 27, 2008 and $41 million as of December 29, 2007). During 2009, the tax benefit that we realized for the tax deduction from option exercises and other awards totaled $119 million ($147 million in 2008 and $265 million in 2007). We estimate the fair value of restricted stock unit awards with time-based vesting using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting. We estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock units using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant. We based the weighted average estimated values of restricted stock unit grants, as well as the weighted average assumptions that we used in calculating the fair value, on estimates at the date of grant, as follows: ##TABLE_START              2009 2008 2007 Estimated values $ 14.63 $ 19.94 $ 21.13 Risk-free interest rate 0.9 % 2.1 % 4.7 % Dividend yield 3.5 % 2.6 % 2.0 % Volatility 46 % n/a n/a ##TABLE_END We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted under our equity incentive plans and rights to acquire common stock granted under our stock purchase plan. We based the weighted average estimated values of employee stock option grants (excluding stock option grants in connection with the Option Exchange) and rights granted under the stock purchase plan, as well as the weighted average assumptions used in calculating these values, on estimates at the date of grant, as follows: ##TABLE_START                          Stock Options Stock Purchase Plan 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Estimated values $ 4.72 $ 5.74 $ 5.79 $ 4.14 $ 5.32 $ 5.18 Expected life (in years) 4.9 5.0 5.0 .5 .5 .5 Risk-free interest rate 1.8 % 3.0 % 4.5 % 0.4 % 2.1 % 5.2 % Volatility 46 % 37 % 26 % 44 % 35 % 28 % Dividend yield 3.6 % 2.7 % 2.0 % 3.6 % 2.5 % 2.0 % ##TABLE_END We base the expected volatility on implied volatility, because we have determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. We use the simplified method of calculating expected life, due to significant differences in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to our historical grants.

INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Stock Purchase Plan Approximately 80% of our employees were participating in our stock purchase plan as of December 26, 2009. Employees purchased 30.9 million shares in 2009 for $344 million under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan (25.9 million shares for $453 million in 2008 and 26.1 million shares for $428 million in 2007). As of December 26, 2009, there was $9 million in unrecognized compensation costs related to rights to acquire common stock under our stock purchase plan. We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of one month. Note 24: Common Stock Repurchases Common Stock Repurchase Program We have an ongoing authorization, amended in November 2005, from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $25 billion in shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. As of December 26, 2009, $5.7 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization. During 2009, we utilized the majority of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2009 debentures to repurchase 88.2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1.7 billion (for further information on the issuance of the 2009 debentures, see Note 20: Borrowings). We repurchased 324 million shares at a cost of $7.1 billion during 2008 and 111 million shares at a cost of $2.75 billion during 2007. We have repurchased and retired 3.4 billion shares at a cost of $69 billion since the program began in 1990. Our repurchases in 2009 and a portion of our purchases in 2008 and 2007 were executed in privately negotiated transactions. Restricted Stock Unit Withholdings We issue restricted stock units as part of our equity incentive plans. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. During 2009, we withheld 5.8 million shares (3.5 million shares during 2008 and 1.7 million shares during 2007) to satisfy $92 million ($78 million during 2008 and $38 million during 2007) of employees tax obligations. Although shares withheld are not issued, they are treated as common stock repurchases in our consolidated financial statements, as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. Note 25: Earnings Per Share We computed our basic and diluted earnings per common share as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 2009 2008 2007 Net income available to common stockholders 1 $ 4,369 $ 5,292 $ 6,976 Weighted average common shares outstandingbasic 5,557 5,663 5,816 Dilutive effect of employee equity incentive plans 37 34 69 Dilutive effect of convertible debt 51 51 51 Weighted average common shares outstandingdiluted 5,645 5,748 5,936 Basic earnings per common share $ 0.79 $ 0.93 $ 1.20 Diluted earnings per common share $ 0.77 $ 0.92 $ 1.18 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 Net income available to participating securities was insignificant in 2009. ##TABLE_END 97 INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) We computed our basic earnings per common share using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We computed diluted earnings per common share using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan. Potentially dilutive common shares are determined by applying the if-converted method for the 2005 debentures. However, as our 2009 debentures require settlement of the principal amount of the debt in cash upon conversion, with the conversion premium paid in cash or stock at our option, potentially dilutive common shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method for these debentures. For further discussion on the specific conversion features of our 2005 and 2009 debentures, see Note 20: Borrowings. For 2009, we excluded 486 million outstanding weighted average stock options (484 million in 2008 and 417 million in 2007) from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the exercise prices of these stock options were greater than or equal to the average market value of the common shares. These options could be included in the calculation in the future if the average market value of the common shares increases and is greater than the exercise price of these options. We also excluded our 2009 debentures from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the conversion option of these debentures was anti-dilutive. In the future, we could have potentially dilutive shares if the average market price is above the conversion price. Note 26: Comprehensive Income The components of total comprehensive income were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net income $ 4,369 $ 5,292 $ 6,976 Other comprehensive income (loss) 786 (654 ) 318 Total comprehensive income $ 5,155 $ 4,638 $ 7,294 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The components of other comprehensive income (loss) and related tax effects were as follows: ##TABLE_START                                      2009 2008 2007 (In Millions) Before Tax Tax Net of Tax Before Tax Tax Net of Tax Before Tax Tax Net of Tax Change in unrealized holding gain (loss) on investments $ 578 $ (210 ) $ 368 $ (764 ) $ 279 $ (485 ) $ 420 $ (155 ) $ 265 Less: adjustment for (gain) loss on investments included in net income 50 (18 ) 32 34 (12 ) 22 (85 ) 31 (54 ) Change in deferred tax asset valuation allowance 1  146 146       Change in unrealized holding gain (loss) on derivatives 75 (4 ) 71 (23 ) 8 (15 ) 80 (21 ) 59 Less: adjustment for amortization of (gain) loss on derivatives included in net income 22 (1 ) 21 (58 ) 21 (37 ) (55 ) 16 (39 ) Change in prior service costs 20 (7 ) 13 5 (2 ) 3 4 (1 ) 3 Change in actuarial loss 157 (23 ) 134 (220 ) 78 (142 ) 106 (22 ) 84 Change in transition obligation 1  1       Total other comprehensive income (loss) $ 903 $ (117 ) $ 786 $ (1,026 ) $ 372 $ (654 ) $ 470 $ (152 ) $ 318 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 Amount is related to the reversal of a portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance attributed to changes in unrealized holding gains on our available-for-sale investments.

The difference between the tax provision at the statutory federal income tax rate and the tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes (effective tax rate) was as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Percentages) 2009 2008 2007 Statutory federal income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Increase (reduction) in rate resulting from: Non-U.S. income taxed at different rates (12.4 ) (4.2 ) (4.7 ) European Commission fine 8.9   Settlements, effective settlements, and related remeasurements (6.4 ) (1.3 ) (5.3 ) Research and development tax credits (2.0 ) (1.4 ) (1.3 ) Domestic manufacturing deduction benefit (1.5 ) (1.7 ) (1.1 ) Deferred tax asset valuation allowance  unrealized losses 0.2 3.4  Other 1.6 1.3 1.3 Effective tax rate 23.4 % 31.1 % 23.9 % ##TABLE_END During 2009, net income tax deficiencies attributable to equity-based compensation transactions that were allocated to stockholders equity totaled $41 million (net benefits of $8 million in 2008 and $123 million in 2007). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at year-ends were as follows: ##TABLE_START          (In Millions) 2009 2008 1 Deferred tax assets Accrued compensation and other benefits $ 568 $ 529 Deferred income 228 160 Share-based compensation 774 669 Inventory 340 602 Unrealized losses on investments and derivatives 407 762 State credits and net operating losses 187 138 Investment in foreign subsidiaries 129 50 Capital losses 150  Other, net 386 337 Gross deferred tax assets 3,169 3,247 Valuation allowance (329 ) (358 ) Total deferred tax assets $ 2,840 $ 2,889 Deferred tax liabilities Property, plant and equipment $ (817 ) $ (507 ) Convertible debt (708 ) (332 ) Licenses and intangibles (129 ) (54 ) Other, net (247 ) (141 ) Total deferred tax liabilities $ (1,901 ) $ (1,034 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 939 $ 1,855 Reported as: Current deferred tax assets $ 1,216 $ 1,390 Non-current deferred tax assets 2 278 511 Non-current deferred tax liabilities (555 ) (46 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 939 $ 1,855 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 As adjusted due to changes to the accounting for convertible debt instruments. See Note 3: Accounting Changes.  2 Included within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. ##TABLE_END The valuation allowance is based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. The valuation allowance as of December 26, 2009 included allowances related to unrealized state credit carry forwards of $135 million, investment asset impairments of $118 million, and depreciation expense and other matters related to our non-U.S. subsidiaries of $76 million. As of December 26, 2009, we had not recognized U.S. deferred income taxes on a cumulative total of $10.1 billion of undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. Determining the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to investments in these non-U.S. subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested is not practicable. We currently intend to reinvest those earnings in operations outside the U.S. Effective at the beginning of 2007, we adopted standards that changed the accounting for uncertain tax positions. As a result of the implementation of these standards, we reduced the liability for net unrecognized tax benefits by $181 million, and accounted for the reduction as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $181 million. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Long-term income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and non-U.S. tax credits, and may also include other long-term tax liabilities that are not uncertain but have not yet been paid. The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows: ##TABLE_START      (In Millions) Beginning balance as of December 31, 2006 (date of adoption) $ 1,896 Settlements and effective settlements with tax authorities and related remeasurements (1,243 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods 106 Decreases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods (26 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during current period 61 December 29, 2007 $ 794 Settlements and effective settlements with tax authorities and related remeasurements (154 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods 72 Decreases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods (84 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during current period 116 December 27, 2008 $ 744 Settlements and effective settlements with tax authorities and related remeasurements (526 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods 28 Decreases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods (58 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during current period 32 December 26, 2009 $ 220 ##TABLE_END During 2007, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) closed its examination of our tax returns for the years 1999 through 2002, resolving issues related to the tax benefits for export sales as well as a number of other issues. Additionally, we reached a settlement with the IRS for years 2003 through 2005 with respect to the tax benefits for export sales. In connection with the $739 million settlement with the IRS, we reversed long-term income taxes payable, which resulted in a $276 million tax benefit in 2007. Also during 2007, we effectively settled with the IRS several other matters related to the audit for the 2003 and 2004 tax years, despite the fact that the IRS audit for those years remains open. The result of effectively settling those positions and the process of re-evaluating, based on all available information and certain required remeasurements, was a reduction of $389 million in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, $155 million of which resulted in a tax benefit in 2007. During 2008, we reached a settlement with the IRS and certain state tax authorities related to prior years. The result of the settlements and related remeasurements was a reduction of $154 million in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, $103 million of which resulted in a tax benefit in 2008. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) During 2009, we settled and effectively settled matters with the IRS and certain state tax authorities related to tax positions taken during prior periods. The result of the settlements, effective settlements, and resulting remeasurements was a reduction of $526 million in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, $366 million of which resulted in a tax benefit in 2009. If the remaining balance of $220 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 26, 2009 ($744 million as of December 27, 2008) were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $101 million and a reduction of the effective tax rate ($590 million as of December 27, 2008). During all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of operations. In 2009, we recognized a net benefit of $62 million, primarily due to the reversal of accrued interest and penalties related to settled and effectively settled matters described above ($6 million of expense in 2008 and a net benefit of $142 million in 2007). As of December 26, 2009, we had $55 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits ($153 million as of December 27, 2008). Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure on audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. However, given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. We had state tax credits of $219 million as of December 26, 2009 that will expire between 2010 and 2020. We file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and non-U.S. tax returns. For U.S. state and non-U.S. tax returns, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 1996. For U.S. federal tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2003. Note 28: Contingencies Legal Proceedings We are currently a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted in this section. While management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm the companys financial position, cash flows, or overall trends in results of operations, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include substantial money damages, and in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of intellectual property. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. Except as may be otherwise indicated, the outcomes in these matters are not reasonably estimable. A number of proceedings, described below, generally challenge certain of our competitive practices, contending generally that we improperly condition price rebates and other discounts on our microprocessors on exclusive or near-exclusive dealing by some of our customers. We believe that we compete lawfully and that our marketing practices benefit our customers and our stockholders, and we will continue to vigorously defend ourselves. While we have settled some of these matters, the distractions caused by challenges to our business practices from the remaining matters are undesirable, and the legal and other costs associated with defending our position have been and continue to be significant. We assume that these challenges could continue for a number of years and may require the investment of substantial additional management time and substantial financial resources to explain and defend our position. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and AMD International Sales  Service, Ltd. v. Intel Corporation and Intel Kabushiki Kaisha, and Related Consumer Class Actions and Government Investigations In June 2005, AMD filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that we and our Japanese subsidiary engaged in various actions in violation of the Sherman Act and the California Business and Professions Code, including, among other things, providing discounts and rebates to our manufacturer and distributor customers conditioned on exclusive or near-exclusive dealing that allegedly unfairly interfered with AMDs ability to sell its microprocessors, interfering with certain AMD product launches, and interfering with AMDs participation in certain industry standards-setting groups. AMDs complaint sought unspecified treble damages, punitive damages, an injunction requiring Intel to cease any conduct found to be unlawful, and attorneys fees and costs. AMDs Japanese subsidiary also filed suits in the Tokyo High Court and the Tokyo District Court against our Japanese subsidiary, asserting violations of Japans Antimonopoly Law and alleging damages in each suit of approximately $55 million, plus various other costs and fees. On November 12, 2009, Intel Corporation and AMD announced a comprehensive agreement to end all outstanding legal disputes between the companies, including antitrust litigation and patent cross-license disputes. Under terms of the agreement, AMD and Intel obtained patent rights from a new five-year cross-license agreement, Intel and AMD gave up any claims of breach from the previous license agreement, and Intel paid AMD $1.25 billion. We recorded the related charge within marketing, general and administrative on the consolidated statements of operations. Intel also agreed to abide by a set of business practice provisions. As a result, AMD dropped all pending litigation, including the case in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and two cases pending in Japan. AMD also withdrew all of its regulatory complaints worldwide. In addition, at least 82 separate class actions have been filed in the U.S. District Courts for the Northern District of California, Southern District of California, District of Idaho, District of Nebraska, District of New Mexico, District of Maine, and District of Delaware, as well as in various California, Kansas, and Tennessee state courts. These actions generally repeat AMDs allegations and assert various consumer injuries, including that consumers in various states have been injured by paying higher prices for computers containing our microprocessors. All of the federal class actions and the Kansas and Tennessee state court class actions have been consolidated by the Multidistrict Litigation Panel to the District of Delaware. In January 2010, the plaintiffs in the Delaware action filed a motion for sanctions for Intels failure to preserve evidence. This motion largely copies a motion previously filed by AMD in the AMD litigation, which has settled. The putative class in the coordinated actions has moved for class certification, which we are in the process of opposing. All California class actions have been consolidated to the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County. The plaintiffs in the California actions have moved for class certification, which we are in the process of opposing. At our request, the court in the California actions has agreed to delay ruling on this motion until after the Delaware Federal Court rules on the similar motion in the coordinated actions. We dispute the class-action claims, and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. We are also subject to certain antitrust regulatory inquiries. In 2001, the European Commission (EC) commenced an investigation regarding claims by AMD that we used unfair business practices to persuade clients to buy our microprocessors. Since that time, we have received numerous requests for information and documents from the EC, and we have responded to each of those requests. The EC issued a Statement of Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. On May 13, 2009, the EC issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged conditional rebates and payments that required Intel customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged payments to prevent sales of specific rival products. The EC imposed a fine on us in the amount of 1.06 billion ($1.447 billion as of May 13, 2009), which we paid during the third quarter of 2009, and also ordered us to immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in the EC decision. We recorded the related charge within marketing, general and administrative on the consolidated statements of operations. We strongly disagree with the ECs decision, and we have appealed the decision to the General Court (formerly the Court of First Instance). The EC announced that it would actively monitor Intels compliance with its decision. We have taken steps, which are subject to the ECs ongoing review, to comply with that decision pending appeal. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In June 2005, we received an inquiry from the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) requesting documents from our Korean subsidiary related to marketing and rebate programs that we entered into with Korean PC manufacturers. In February 2006, the KFTC initiated an inspection of documents at our offices in Korea. In September 2007, the KFTC served us an Examination Report alleging that sales to two customers during parts of 20022005 violated Koreas Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act. In December 2007, we submitted our written response to the KFTC. In February 2008, the KFTCs examiner submitted a written reply to our response. In March 2008, we submitted a further response. In April 2008, we participated in a pre-hearing conference before the KFTC, and we participated in formal hearings in May and June 2008. In June 2008, the KFTC announced its intent to fine us approximately $25 million for providing discounts to Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and TriGem Computer Inc. In November 2008, the KFTC issued a final written decision concluding that Intels discounts had violated Korean antitrust law and imposing a fine on Intel of approximately $20 million, which Intel paid in January 2009. In December 2008, Intel appealed this decision by filing a lawsuit in the Seoul High Court seeking to overturn the KFTCs decision. The KFTC through its attorneys filed its answer to Intels complaint in March 2009. Thereafter Intel and the KFTC will provide arguments to the court in sequential briefs. In November 2009, the State of New York filed a lawsuit against Intel in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The lawsuit alleges that Intel violated federal antitrust laws; the New York Donnelly Act, which prohibits contracts or agreements to monopolize; and the New York Executive Law, which proscribes underlying violations of federal and state antitrust laws. The lawsuit alleges that Intel has engaged in a systematic worldwide campaign of illegal, exclusionary conduct to maintain its monopoly power and prices in the market for x86 microprocessors through the use of various alleged actions, including exclusive or near-exclusive agreements from large computer makers in exchange for loyalty payments and bribes, and other alleged threats and retaliation. The plaintiff claims that Intels alleged actions harmed consumers, competition, and innovation. The lawsuit seeks a declaration that Intels alleged actions have violated the federal and New York antitrust laws and the New York Executive Law, an injunction to prevent further alleged unlawful acts, unspecified damages in an amount to be proven at trial, trebled as provided for by law, restitution, disgorgement, $1 million for each violation of the Donnelly Act proven by the plaintiff, and attorneys fees and costs. In January 2010, Intel filed its answer. Intel disagrees with the plaintiffs allegations and claims, and intends to conduct a vigorous defense of the lawsuit. In December 2009, the New York Attorney Generals staff served a subpoena on Intel. That subpoena calls for production of documents and information related to various aspects of Intels notebook computer business, including products that offer graphics capabilities and/or potentially compete with graphic processing units (GPUs). It also calls for production of all documents concerning Intels notebook computer business that Intel previously produced to other U.S. and foreign antitrust agencies in connection with their antitrust investigations of Intel. In June 2008, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a formal investigation into our sales practices. In June 2009, the FTC staff asked for additional information and testimony by some Intel witnesses. During the months that followed, the FTC staff broadened its inquiry and gave Intel only limited opportunities to address staff concerns. Settlement discussions were unsuccessful. In December 2009, three FTC commissioners voted to issue an administrative complaint alleging that Intel had violated Section 5 of the FTC Act by engaging in unfair methods of competition and unfair acts or practices in markets for CPUs and GPUs. This administrative proceeding will lead to a hearing before Chief Administrative Law Judge Chappell that is set to begin in September 2010. Any initial decision rendered by Judge Chappell can be appealed to the Commissioners by both the FTC staff supporting the complaint and by Intel. If the FTC ultimately issues a decision adverse to Intel, that decision can be appealed to a Federal Circuit of Intels choosing. Intel disagrees with the FTCs allegations and claims, and intends to conduct a vigorous defense. Intel/AMD Cross-License Agreement Intel and AMD entered into a patent cross-license in January 2001. Under that license, Intel granted AMD a limited license to certain Intel patents, subject to the terms of that agreement. In October 2008, AMD announced its intention to form a joint venture called The Foundry Company (later renamed GlobalFoundries Inc.) with two investment entities of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. In March 2009, AMD announced that it had closed this transaction. AMD has claimed that GlobalFoundries is entitled to a license to Intel patents under the 2001 Intel/AMD cross-license. Intel disagreed with that claim and also claimed that AMD had breached the Intel/AMD 2001 cross-license. In November 2009, Intel and AMD resolved these disputes as part of a comprehensive settlement and entered into a new five-year cross-license agreement. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Antitrust Derivative Litigation and Related Matters In February 2008, Martin Smilow, an Intel stockholder, filed a putative derivative action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against members of our Board of Directors. The complaint alleges generally that the Board allowed the company to violate antitrust and other laws, as described in AMDs antitrust lawsuits against us, and that those Board-sanctioned activities have harmed the company. The complaint repeats many of AMDs allegations and references various investigations by the EC, the KFTC, and others. In February 2008, a second plaintiff, Evan Tobias, filed a derivative suit in the same court against the Board containing many of the same allegations as in the Smilow suit. On July 30, 2008, the District Court entered an order directing Smilow and Tobias to file a single, consolidated complaint by August 7, 2008 and directing us to respond within 30 days thereafter. An amended consolidated complaint was filed on August 7, 2008. In June 2009, the Court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the plaintiffs consolidated complaint, with prejudice. In June 2008, a third plaintiff, Christine Del Gaizo, filed a derivative suit in the Santa Clara County Superior Court against the Board, a former director of the Board, and six of our officers, containing many of the same allegations as in the Smilow and Tobias suits. In August 2008, the parties in the California derivative suit entered into a stipulation to stay the action pending further order of the court, and the court entered an order to that effect in September 2008. In November 2009, a fourth plaintiff, Charles Gilman, filed a stockholder derivative suit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Intels current Board members as well as three former Board members. Gilmans complaint makes many of the same allegations raised in the earlier suits, additionally cites a number of excerpts from the ECs ruling, and points to the settlement of the AMD litigation as supposed evidence of damage to Intel. In December 2009, a fifth plaintiff, Louisiana Municipal Police Employee Retirement System (LMPERS), filed a stockholder derivative suit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Intels current Board members as well as three former Board members. LMPERSs complaint makes many of the same allegations raised in the earlier suits, and additionally incorporates by reference the allegations made in the lawsuit filed against Intel by the New York Attorney General. In January 2010, Delaware District Court Judge Farnan signed a stipulated order consolidating the Gilman and LMPERS actions under the name In re Intel Corp. Derivative Litigation . Gilman and LMPERS filed a consolidated complaint in February 2010. We deny the allegations in all of these derivative suits and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. Intel stockholders Martin Smilow and the Rosenfeld Family Foundation filed an action in Delaware Chancery Court in November 2009 to enforce an inspection demand that they had previously made pursuant to section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Intel denies the allegations and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously. Intel Corporation v. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) In May 2005, Intel filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against CSIRO, an Australian research institute. CSIRO had sent letters to Intel customers claiming that products compliant with the IEEE 802.11a and 802.11g standards infringe CSIROs U.S. Patent No. 5,487,069 (the 069 patent). Intels lawsuit sought a declaration that the CSIRO patent is invalid and that no Intel product infringes it. Dell Inc. was a co-declaratory judgment plaintiff with Intel; Microsoft Corporation, Netgear Inc., and Hewlett-Packard Company filed a similar, separate lawsuit against CSIRO. In its amended answer, CSIRO claimed that various Intel products compliant with the IEEE 802.11a, 802.11g, and/or draft 802.11n standards infringe the 069 patent. In 2009, we entered into a settlement agreement with CSIRO pursuant to which, among other things, we made payments to CSIRO in exchange for a license to certain patents. The settlement agreement did not significantly impact our results of operations or cash flows. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Lehman Matter In November 2009, representatives of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. advised Intel informally that the Lehman bankruptcy estate was considering a claim against Intel arising from a 2008 forward-share purchase contract. The transaction at issue was between Intel and Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. (together with its affiliate Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Lehman), which entered into a $1.0 billion forward-purchase agreement to purchase shares of Intel common stock. Under the terms of the agreement, Intel provided a $1.0 billion pre-payment to Lehman, in exchange for which Lehman was required to purchase $1.0 billion in shares of Intel common stock, calculated at a volume weighted average price from August 26, 2008 to September 26, 2008. Intel received an equivalent $1.0 billion of cash collateral from Lehman. Lehman was obligated to deliver approximately 50 million shares of Intel common stock to Intel on September 29, 2008. Lehman failed to deliver any shares of Intel common stock, and Intel foreclosed on the $1.0 billion collateral. No specific information has been provided by Lehman regarding the nature or scope of the potential claims, other than the assertion that Lehman contends that it suffered damages in a range between $130 million and $380 million. In February 2010, Lehman served a subpoena on Intel in connection with this transaction, but Lehman has not initiated any action against Intel to date. We believe that Intel acted appropriately under its agreement with Lehman, in light of Lehmans bankruptcy filing, and we intend to defend any claim to the contrary. Saxon Innovations, LLC v. Intel Corporation In August 2008, Saxon Innovations, LLC filed an action for patent infringement against six personal computer OEMs (Apple Inc., Gateway, Inc., Acer Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, Dell Inc., and ASUSTeK Computer Inc.) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The asserted patents are U.S. Patent No. 5,592,555, entitled Wireless Communications Privacy Method and System; U.S. Patent No. 5,502,689, entitled Clock Generator Capable of Shut-Down Mode and Clock Generation Method; U.S. Patent No. 5,530,597, entitled Apparatus and Method for Disabling Interrupt Masks in Processors or the Like; U.S. Patent No. 5,247,621, entitled System and Method for Processor Bus Use; and U.S. Patent No. 5,235,635, entitled Keypad Monitor with Keypad Activity-Based Activation. The complaint sought unspecified damages and a permanent injunction. In September 2008, Intel filed an unopposed motion to intervene in the case. In response, Saxon Innovations filed a counterclaim against Intel, accusing Intel of infringing the patents listed above, and asserting two additional patents against Intel: U.S. Patent No. 5,422,832, entitled Variable Thermal Sensor, and U.S. Patent No. 5,829,031, entitled Microprocessor Configured to Detect a Group of Instructions and to Perform a Specific Function upon Detection. In January 2010, we entered into a settlement agreement with Saxon Innovations pursuant to which, among other things, we made a payment to Saxon Innovations in exchange for a license to certain patents. The settlement agreement did not significantly impact our results of operations or cash flows. Frank T. Shum v. Intel Corporation, Jean-Marc Verdiell, and LightLogic, Inc. Intel acquired LightLogic, Inc. in May 2001. Frank Shum has sued Intel, LightLogic, and LightLogics founder, Jean-Marc Verdiell, claiming that much of LightLogics intellectual property is based on alleged inventions that Shum conceived while he and Verdiell were partners at Radiance Design, Inc. Shum has alleged claims for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent concealment, and breach of contract. Shum also seeks alleged correction of inventorship of seven patents acquired by Intel as part of the LightLogic acquisition. In January 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California denied Shums inventorship claim, and thereafter granted Intels motion for summary judgment on Shums remaining claims. In August 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the District Courts rulings and remanded the case for further proceedings. In October 2008, the District Court granted Intels motion for summary judgment on Shums claims for breach of fiduciary duty and fraudulent concealment, but denied Intels motion on Shums remaining claims. A jury trial on Shums remaining claims took place in November and December 2008. In pre-trial proceedings and at trial, Shum requested monetary damages against the defendants in amounts ranging from $31 million to $931 million, and his final request to the jury was for as much as $175 million. Following deliberations, the jury was unable to reach a verdict on most of the claims. With respect to Shums claim that he is the proper inventor on certain LightLogic patents now assigned to Intel, the jury agreed with Shum on some of those claims. But the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the breach of contract, fraud, or unjust enrichment claims. In April 2009, the court granted defendants motions for judgment as a matter of law. Shum has appealed that ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation v. Intel Corporation In February 2008, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation filed an action for patent infringement against Intel in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin. The complaint generally alleged that Intel infringed U.S. Patent No. 5,781,752 by making, using, offering for sale, importing, and/or selling certain of Intels microprocessors, including the Intel  Core tm 2 Duo processor family with Smart Memory Access and any other microprocessor using the same or a similar memory disambiguation technique. In 2009, we entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which, among other things, we made a payment to the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation in exchange for a license to certain patents. The settlement agreement did not significantly impact our results of operations or cash flows. Note 29: Operating Segment and Geographic Information At the end of 2009, we reorganized our business to better align our major product groups around the core competencies of Intel architecture and our manufacturing operations. After the reorganization, we have nine operating segments, including PC Client Group, Data Center Group, Embedded and Communications Group, Digital Home Group, Ultra-Mobility Group, NAND Solutions Group, Wind River Software Group, Software and Services Group, and Digital Health Group. All prior-period amounts have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect the new organizational structure. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our President and Chief Executive Officer. The CODM allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about its revenue and operating income (loss). Our PC Client Group and our Data Center Group are reportable operating segments. We also aggregate and disclose the financial results of the following non-reportable operating segments, whose product lines are based on Intel architecture: Embedded and Communications Group, Digital Home Group, and Ultra-Mobility Group. These non-reportable operating segments are aggregated, as they have similar economic characteristics and their operations are similar in nature. These aggregated operating segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have chosen to disclose the aggregation of these non-reportable operating segments into the other Intel architecture operating segments category. Revenue for our reportable and aggregated non-reportable operating segments is primarily related to the following product lines: ##TABLE_START   PC Client Group. Includes microprocessors and related chipsets and motherboards designed for the desktop (including high-end enthusiast PCs), notebook, and netbook market segments; and wireless connectivity products.   Data Center Group. Includes microprocessors and related chipsets and motherboards designed for the server, workstation, and storage computing market segments; and wired network connectivity products.   Other Intel architecture operating segments. Includes microprocessors and related chipsets for embedded applications and products designed for the ultra-mobile market segment, which includes various handheld devices; and products for the consumer electronics market segments. ##TABLE_END Our NAND Solutions Group, Wind River Software Group, Software and Services Group, and Digital Health Group operating segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments and are included within the other operating segments category. Revenue within the corporate category is primarily related to divested businesses for which discrete operating results are not reviewed by our CODM to assess performance and allocate resources. This includes revenue related to our NOR flash memory and cellular and handheld businesses, as well as revenue and expenses related to supply and service agreements that were entered into as part of these divestitures (see Note 16: Divestitures). We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments, and the expenses are included in the operating results reported below. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) During 2009, we incurred charges of $1.447 billion (1.06 billion) as a result of the fine from the EC and $1.25 billion as a result of our legal settlement with AMD. For further information, see Note 28: Contingencies. These charges were included in the corporate category, which also includes expenses and charges such as: ##TABLE_START   amounts included within restructuring and asset impairment charges;   a portion of profit-dependent compensation and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments;   results of operations of seed businesses that support our initiatives; and   acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. ##TABLE_END The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Except as discussed above, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole. Net revenue and operating income (loss) for the three years ended December 26, 2009 were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net revenue PC Client Group Microprocessor revenue $ 19,914 $ 21,516 $ 21,053 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 6,261 6,450 6,077 26,175 27,966 27,130 Data Center Group Microprocessor revenue 5,301 5,126 4,796 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 1,149 1,464 1,659 6,450 6,590 6,455 Other Intel architecture operating segments 1,402 1,763 1,908 Other operating segments 970 579 447 Corporate 130 688 2,394 Total net revenue $ 35,127 $ 37,586 $ 38,334 Operating income (loss) PC Client Group $ 7,585 $ 9,419 $ 8,535 Data Center Group 2,299 2,135 2,105 Other Intel architecture operating segments (179 ) (63 ) 47 Other operating segments (284 ) (1,042 ) (864 ) Corporate (3,710 ) (1,495 ) (1,607 ) Total operating income $ 5,711 $ 8,954 $ 8,216 ##TABLE_END In 2009, one customer accounted for 21% of our net revenue (20% in 2008 and 17% in 2007), while another customer accounted for 17% of our net revenue (18% in 2008 and 2007). The majority of the revenue from these customers was from the sale of microprocessors, chipsets, and other components by the PC Client Group and the Data Center Group operating segments. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Geographic revenue information for the three years ended December 26, 2009 is based on the location of the customer. Revenue from unaffiliated customers was as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Asia-Pacific (geographic region/country) Taiwan $ 10,574 $ 9,868 $ 8,606 China (including Hong Kong) 5,835 4,974 5,295 Other Asia-Pacific 2,933 4,202 5,531 19,342 19,044 19,432 Americas (geographic region/country) United States 5,280 5,462 6,015 Other Americas 1,838 1,981 1,700 7,118 7,443 7,715 Europe 5,278 7,116 7,262 Japan 3,389 3,983 3,925 Total net revenue $ 35,127 $ 37,586 $ 38,334 ##TABLE_END Revenue from unaffiliated customers outside the U.S. totaled $29,847 million in 2009 ($32,124 million in 2008 and $32,319 million in 2007).

REPORT OF ERNST  YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders, Intel Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intel Corporation as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2009. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Part IV, Item 15. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Intel Corporation at December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. As discussed in Notes 3 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements, Intel Corporation changed its method of accounting for convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features during 2009, its method of accounting for sabbatical leave as of December 31, 2006, and its method of accounting for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2006. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Intel Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 22, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP San Jose, California February 22, 2010 REPORT OF ERNST  YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders, Intel Corporation We have audited Intel Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Intel Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Intel Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on managements evaluation (with the participation of our CEO and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2009, the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Managements assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. Based on our assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst  Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their attestation report, which is included at the end of Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

Products We design and manufacture computing and communications components, such as microprocessors, chipsets, motherboards, and wireless and wired connectivity products. Our platforms incorporate software to enable and advance these components. We strive to optimize the overall performance of our products by improving energy efficiency, seamless connectivity to the Internet, and security features. Improved energy efficiency is achieved by lowering power consumption in relation to performance capabilities, and may result in longer battery life, reduced system heat output, power savings, and lower total cost of ownership. Increased performance can include faster processing performance and other improved capabilities, such as multithreading, multitasking, and processor graphics. Performance can also be improved by enhancing interoperability among devices, storage, manageability, utilization, reliability, and ease of use. Our vision is to create a continuum of personal computing experiences based on Intel  architecture. This continuum would give consumers a set of secure, consistent, and personalized computing experiences with a variety of devices that connect to the Internet and each other. Our goal is to provide consistency and interoperability between devices that are connected seamlessly and require computing capability both locally and in cloud computing. Cloud computing is a group of linked servers that provides a variety of applications and data to users over the Internet. Components Microprocessors A microprocessorthe central processing unit (CPU) of a computer systemprocesses system data and controls other devices in the system. We offer microprocessors with one or multiple processor cores designed for notebooks, netbooks, desktops, servers, workstations, storage products, embedded applications, communications products, consumer electronics devices, and handheld devices. Multi-core microprocessors can enable improved multitasking and energy-efficient performance by distributing computing tasks across two or more cores. The majority of our microprocessors are manufactured using our 32-nanometer (nm) second-generation Hi-k metal gate silicon process technology (32nm process technology). The use of Hi-k metal gate transistors increases performance while simultaneously reducing the leakage of electrical current. In December 2010, we introduced the 2nd generation Intel  Core tm processor family (formerly code-named Sandy Bridge), a new microarchitecture based on our 32nm process technology. Microarchitecture refers to the layout, density, and logical design of a microprocessor. Our 2nd generation Intel Core processor family incorporates features designed to increase performance and energy efficiency, such as: ##TABLE_START   Integrated processor graphics, which allow for shared resources across processing cores and graphics architectures to enable optimal performance while saving power;   Intel  Advanced Vector Extensions , which allow for faster and simpler performance of computationally intensive tasks, such as digital photo editing, creation of music, and other content creation;   Intel  Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 , which automatically increases processor frequency when applications demand higher performance; and   Intel  Quick Sync Video, which accelerates encoding, decoding, and transcoding features, such as conversion of media for portable players and online video-sharing services. ##TABLE_END Our 2nd generation Intel Core processor family integrates graphics functionality onto the processor die. In contrast, some of our previous-generation 32nm processors have incorporated a separate 45nm graphics chip inside the processor package. We also offer graphics functionality as part of a separate chipset outside the processor package. Processor packages may also integrate the memory controller. In addition, we offer and are continuing to develop System on Chip (SoC) products that integrate our core processing functionalities with other system components, such as graphics, audio, and video, onto a single chip to form a purpose-built solution. SoC products are designed to reduce total cost of ownership, and provide improved performance due to higher integration, lower power consumption, and smaller form factors. Chipsets A chipset sends data between the microprocessor and input, display, and storage devices, such as the keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard drive or solid-state drive, and CD, DVD, or Blu-ray* drive. We offer chipsets designed for notebooks, netbooks, desktops, servers, workstations, storage products, embedded applications, communications products, consumer electronics devices, and handheld devices. Chipsets extend the audio, video, and other capabilities of many systems and perform essential logic functions, such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks. Some chipsets may also include graphics functionality or both graphics functionality and a memory controller, for use with our microprocessors that do not integrate those system components. Motherboards We offer motherboard products designed for our desktop, server, and workstation platforms. A motherboard is the principal board within a system, and typically contains the microprocessor, chipset, memory, and other components. The motherboard also has connectors for attaching devices to the bus, which is the subsystem that transfers data among various components of a computer. Wireless and Wired Connectivity We offer wireless and wired connectivity products, including network adapters and embedded wireless cards, based on industry-standard protocols used to translate and transmit data across networks. Wireless connectivity products based on WiFi technology allow users to wirelessly connect to high-speed local area networks, typically within a close range. We have also developed wireless connectivity products for both mobile and fixed networks based on WiMAX, a standards-based wireless technology providing high-speed broadband connectivity that can link users and networks up to several miles apart. Microprocessor and Platform Technologies We offer features to improve microprocessor and platform capabilities that can enhance system performance and the user experience. For example, we offer technologies that can help information technology managers maintain, manage, and protect enabled systems that are plugged into a power source and connected to a network, even if a computer is turned off or has a failed hard drive or operating system. We also offer technologies that can enable virtualization, in which a single computer system can function as multiple virtual systems by running multiple operating systems and applications. Virtualization can consolidate workloads and provide increased security and management capabilities. To take advantage of these and other features that we offer, a computer system must have a microprocessor that supports a chipset, BIOS (basic input/output system) that uses the technology, and software that is optimized for the technology. Performance will vary depending on the system hardware and software used. We also offer technology that enables each processor core to process two software tasks or threads simultaneously. Additional Product Offerings We offer NAND flash memory, which is a specialized type of memory component primarily used in portable memory storage devices, digital camera memory cards, solid-state drives, and other devices. NAND flash memory retains information even when the power is off, and provides faster access to data than traditional hard drives. Because flash memory does not have any moving parts, it tolerates bumps and shocks better than devices such as rapidly spinning disk drives. We offer certain software products, including operating systems, middleware, and tools used to develop, run, and manage a wide variety of enterprise, consumer, embedded, and handheld devices. In addition, we offer software development tools, designed to complement our latest hardware technologies, that help enable the creation of applications.

As of December 25, 2010, we primarily manufactured our products in wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations: ##TABLE_START          Products Wafer Size Process Technology Locations Microprocessors 300mm 32nm Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico Microprocessors 300mm 45nm Israel, New Mexico Chipsets and microprocessors 300mm 65nm Ireland, Arizona, China Chipsets and other products 300mm 90nm Ireland Chipsets and other products 200mm 130nm and above Massachusetts, Ireland ##TABLE_END As of December 25, 2010, the majority of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers using our 32nm process technology. In the second half of 2011, we expect to begin manufacturing microprocessors using our 22nm process technology. As we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology, we incur significant start-up costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing. However, continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs. The benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor, reducing heat output from each transistor, and/or increasing the number of integrated features on each chip. These advancements can result in microprocessors that are higher performing, consume less power, and/or cost less to manufacture. We use third-party manufacturing companies (foundries) to manufacture wafers for certain components, including networking and communications products. In addition, we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture board-level products and systems, and purchase certain communications networking products from external vendors in the Asia-Pacific region. Following the manufacturing process, the majority of our components are subject to assembly and test. We perform our components assembly and test at facilities in Malaysia, China, Costa Rica, and Vietnam. Our Vietnam facility began production in the first half of 2010. To augment capacity, we use subcontractors to perform assembly of certain products, primarily chipsets and networking and communications products. Our NAND flash memory products are manufactured by IMFT, a NAND flash memory manufacturing company that we formed with Micron Technology, Inc. Our NAND flash memory products are manufactured by IMFT using 25nm, 34nm, or 50nm process technology. As of December 25, 2010, we were committed to purchase 49% of the manufactured output of IMFT. Assembly and test of NAND flash memory products is performed by Micron and other external subcontractors. See Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our employment practices are consistent with, and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by, local country law. In addition, we impose a minimum employee age requirement as well as progressive EHS requirements, regardless of local law. We have thousands of suppliers, including subcontractors, providing our various materials and service needs. We set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments. We communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary. We seek, where possible, to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources, but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country. In those cases, we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply. We have entered into long-term contracts with certain suppliers to ensure a portion of our silicon supply. Our products are typically produced at multiple Intel facilities at various sites around the world, or by subcontractors who have multiple facilities. However, some products are produced in only one Intel or subcontractor facility, and we seek to implement action plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Research and Development We are committed to investing in world-class technology development, particularly in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits. Research and development (RD) expenditures in 2010 were $6.6 billion ($5.7 billion in 2009 and 2008). Our RD activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms, which will in turn enable new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers. Our RD activities range from designing and developing new products and manufacturing processes to researching future technologies and products. We are focusing our RD efforts on advanced computing technologies, developing new microarchitectures, advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology, delivering the next generation of microprocessors and chipsets, improving our platform initiatives, and developing software solutions and tools to support our technologies. Our RD efforts enable new levels of performance and address areas such as energy efficiency, security, scalability for multi-core architectures, system manageability, and ease of use. We continue to make significant RD investments in the development of SoCs to enable growth in areas such as handheld devices, embedded applications, and consumer electronics. In addition, we continue to make significant investments in wireless technologies, graphics, and high-performance computing. As part of our RD efforts, we plan to introduce a new microarchitecture for our notebook, desktop, and Intel Xeon processors approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. We refer to this as our tick-tock technology development cadence. In 2010, we introduced our 2nd generation Intel Core microarchitecture, a new microarchitecture using our existing 32nm process technology. We are currently developing 22nm process technology, our next-generation process technology, and expect to begin manufacturing products using that technology in the second half of 2011. Our leadership in silicon technology has enabled us to make Moores Law a reality. Moores Law predicted that transistor density on integrated circuits would double about every two years. Our leadership in silicon technology has also helped expand on the advances anticipated by Moores Law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products and platforms optimized for a wider variety of applications. Our RD model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies, leading standards initiatives, and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies. Our RD initiatives are performed by various internal business groups, and we centrally manage key cross-business group product initiatives to align and prioritize our RD activities across these groups. In addition, we may augment our RD initiatives by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar RD focus areas. For example, we have an agreement with Micron for joint development of NAND flash memory technologies. Employees As of December 25, 2010, we had 82,500 employees worldwide, with approximately 55% of those employees located in the U.S. Sales and Marketing Customers We sell our products primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs). ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, we sell our products to other manufacturers, including makers of a wide range of industrial and communications equipment. Our customers also include those who buy PC components and our other products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customerssystems builders that purchase Intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors. We have a boxed processor program that allows distributors to sell Intel microprocessors in small quantities to these systems-builder customers; boxed processors are also available in direct retail outlets. In 2010, Hewlett-Packard Company accounted for 21% of our net revenue (21% in 2009 and 20% in 2008) and Dell Inc. accounted for 17% of our net revenue (17% in 2009 and 18% in 2008). No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue. For information about revenue and operating income by operating segment, and revenue from unaffiliated customers by geographic region/country, see Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 and Note 30: Operating Segment and Geographic Information in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Sales Arrangements Our products are sold through sales offices throughout the world. Sales of our products are typically made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, private-label branding, and other matters. Most of our sales are made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology. Our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer, even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related costs of sales is deferred. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, generally 30 days after shipment or delivery. Our credit department sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual customers to control credit risk to Intel arising from outstanding account balances. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis, and from this analysis, we establish credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices, such as obtaining some form of third-party guarantee or standby letter of credit, or obtaining credit insurance for all or a portion of the account balance if necessary. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. For information about our allowance for doubtful receivables, see Schedule IIValuation and Qualifying Accounts in Part IV of this Form 10-K. Most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. On most products, there is no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. We have the option to grant credit for, repair, or replace defective products, and there is no contractual limit on the amount of credit that may be granted to a distributor for defective products. Distribution Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. We also utilize third-party sales representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others. Sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory; instead, their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in close proximity to key customers. Backlog We do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is meaningful, as our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Only a small portion of our orders is non-cancelable, and the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant. Seasonal Trends Our microprocessor sales generally have followed a seasonal trend. Historically, our sales have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. Consumer purchases of PCs have historically been higher in the second half of the year, primarily due to back-to-school and holiday demand. In addition, purchases from businesses have also historically tended to be higher in the second half of the year. Marketing Our corporate marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known Intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel Atom, Intel  Pentium  , Intel  Celeron  , Intel Xeon, and Intel Itanium trademarks make up our processor brands. We promote brand awareness and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities include television, print, and Internet advertising, as well as press relations, consumer and trade events, and industry and consumer communications. We market to consumer and business audiences, and focus on building awareness and generating demand for increased performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as Internet connectivity and security. Purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the Intel Inside  Program. This program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Through the Intel Inside Program, certain customers are licensed to place Intel logos on computers containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses the OEMs for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to the OEMs meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include television, print, and Internet marketing. We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers. Competition The semiconductor industry is dynamic, characterized by rapid advances in technology and frequent product introductions. As unit volumes of a product grow, production experience is accumulated and costs typically decrease, further competition develops, and prices decline. The life cycle of our products is very short, sometimes less than a year. These short product life cycles and other factors lead to frequent negotiations with our OEM customers, which typically are large, sophisticated buyers who are also operating in very competitive environments. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to navigate this environment, by improving our products and processes faster than our competitors, anticipating changing customer requirements, developing and launching new products and platforms, pricing our products competitively, and reducing average unit cost. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Our products compete primarily based on performance, energy efficiency, features, price, quality, reliability, brand recognition, and availability. We are focused on offering innovative products and worldwide support for our customers at competitive prices, including providing improved energy-efficient performance, enhanced security, and Internet connectivity. We believe that our computing platforms, which we define as integrated hardware and software computing technologies that are designed to provide an optimized solution, provide us with a competitive advantage compared to components that are used separately. We believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and assembly and test facilities gives us a competitive advantage. This network enables us to have more direct control over our processes, quality control, product cost, volume, timing of production, and other factors. These facilities require significant up-front capital spending and therefore make it difficult for us to reduce our costs in the short term. Many of our competitors do not own such facilities because they may not be able to afford to do so or because their business models involve the use of third-party foundries and assembly and test subcontractors for manufacturing and assembly and test. The third-party foundries and subcontractors may also offer intellectual property, design services, and other goods and services to our competitors. These fabless semiconductor companies include Broadcom Corporation, NVIDIA Corporation, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and VIA Technologies, Inc. Some of our competitors, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), own portions of such facilities through investment or joint-venture arrangements with other companies. We plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work with the computing and communications industries through standards bodies, trade associations, OEMs, ODMs, and independent software and operating system vendors to help align the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models. We frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standards-setting organizations. Our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives and specification development. Our participation does not ensure that any standards or specifications adopted by these organizations will be consistent with our product planning. Microprocessors We continue to be largely dependent on the success of our microprocessor business. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to deliver new microprocessor products with increased performance capabilities and improved energy-efficient performance at competitive prices. Some of our microprocessor competitors, such as AMD, market software-compatible products that compete with our processors. We also face competition from companies offering rival architecture designs, such as Cell Broadband Engine Architecture developed jointly by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Sony Corporation, and Toshiba Corporation; Power Architecture* offered by IBM; ARM* architecture developed by ARM Limited; and Sun Scalable Processor Architecture (SPARC*) offered by Oracle Corporation. In addition, NVIDIA has begun developing CPUs based on the ARM architecture to combine with its graphics processors and has shifted some of the workload traditionally performed by the microprocessor to its graphics processor. AMD has been our primary competitor in the market segments for microprocessors used in notebooks, desktops, and servers, while companies using ARM-based designs are our primary competitors in the growing market segments for microprocessors used in handheld devices and tablets. Companies using ARM-based designs are also targeting the notebook, netbook, and server market segments. ARM does not manufacture microprocessors; they design and license semiconductor intellectual property and offer supporting software and services. Our ability to compete with ARM-based competitors depends on our ability to design and produce high-performance, energy-efficient microprocessors at competitive prices. It also requires us to develop a software ecosystem that appeals to end users and software developers. We have taken a number of steps to build this software ecosystem, including the development of MeeGo*, a Linux-based software platform that will run on multiple hardware platforms; acquiring McAfee, Inc., which we expect to complete in the first quarter of 2011, and Wind River Systems, Inc.; and creating the Intel  Atom tm Developer Program. The following is a list of our main microprocessor competitors by market segment: ##TABLE_START   PC Client: AMD, QUALCOMM, and VIA   Server: AMD, IBM, and Oracle   Application Processors 1 : AMD, Broadcom, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., MediaTek Inc., NVIDIA, QUALCOMM, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., STMicroelectronics N.V., and Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI)   Mobile Communications Processors 2 : MediaTek, QUALCOMM, ST-Ericsson N.V., and TI ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 The application processors market segment includes microprocessors designed for embedded applications, consumer electronics devices, and tablets. 2 The mobile communications processors market segment includes microprocessors designed for handheld devices. ##TABLE_END Chipsets Our chipsets compete with chipsets produced by companies such as AMD (including chipsets marketed under the ATI Technologies, Inc. brand), Broadcom, NVIDIA, Silicon Integrated Systems Corporation, and VIA. We also compete with companies offering graphics components and other special-purpose products used in the notebook, netbook, desktop, and workstation market segments. One aspect of our business model is to incorporate improved performance and advanced properties into our microprocessors and chipsets, for which demand may increasingly be affected by competition from companies whose business models are based on dedicated chipsets and other components, such as graphics controllers. Flash Memory Our NAND flash memory products currently compete with NAND products primarily manufactured by Hynix Semiconductor Inc., Micron, Samsung, SanDisk Corporation, and Toshiba. Connectivity We offer products designed for wireless and wired connectivity, and network processors. Our WiFi and WiMAX products currently compete with products manufactured by Atheros Communications, Inc., Broadcom, QUALCOMM, and other smaller companies. Competition Lawsuits and Government Matters We are currently a party to lawsuits and government matters involving our competitive practices. See Note 29: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Acquisitions and Strategic Investments We expect to complete the acquisition of McAfee in the first quarter of 2011. McAfee is a provider of security products and services that help secure systems and networks. As a result of the acquisition, we expect to hire approximately 6,400 McAfee employees. McAfees offerings will include endpoint security products, system security products, consumer security products, network security products, and risk and compliance products. Many of McAfees products are offered under a software-as-a-service delivery model, an online console used to manage and update hardware and software, which reduces on-premise capital expenses. The anticipated acquisition of McAfee reflects our belief that security is a fundamental component of online computing. As we develop future products and services, security considerations will be as important as our continued focus on energy-efficient performance and Internet connectivity. In the first quarter of 2011, we completed the acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon. As a result of the acquisition, we expect to hire approximately 3,700 employees from Infineon. The WLS business will operate as Intel Mobile Communications and offer mobile phone components such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers, and power management chips. In addition to managing the existing WLS business, the objective of the acquisition is to contribute to our strategy to provide solutions with Internet connectivity to a broad range of computing devices. During 2009, we completed the acquisition of Wind River Systems, a vendor of software for embedded devices. The objective of the acquisition of Wind River Systems was to enable the introduction of products for the embedded and handheld market segments, resulting in benefits for our existing operations. For further information, see Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Intellectual Property and Licensing Intellectual property rights that apply to our products and services include patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, and maskwork rights. We maintain a program to protect our investment in technology by attempting to ensure respect for our intellectual property rights. The extent of the legal protection given to different types of intellectual property rights varies under different countries legal systems. We intend to license our intellectual property rights where we can obtain adequate consideration. See Competition earlier in this section, Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, and Note 29: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We have filed and obtained a number of patents in the U.S. and other countries. While our patents are an important element of our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted. As we expand our product offerings into new industries, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such product offerings. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other intellectual property, may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain licenses from such companies on favorable terms or at all. The majority of the software that we distribute, including software embedded in our component-level and system-level products, is entitled to copyright protection. To distinguish Intel products from our competitors products, we have obtained certain trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with certain customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect certain details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. Compliance with Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations Our compliance efforts focus on monitoring regulatory and resource trends and setting company-wide performance targets for key resources and emissions. These targets address several parameters, including product design; chemical, energy, and water use; climate change; waste recycling; and emissions. Intel focuses on reducing natural resource use, the solid and chemical waste by-products of our manufacturing processes, and the environmental impact of our products. We currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of EHS laws and regulations. Over the past several years, we have significantly reduced the use of lead and halogenated flame retardants in our products and manufacturing processes. We work with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), non-governmental organizations, OEMs, and retailers to help manage e-waste (which includes electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives) and promote recycling. The European Union requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that allow consumers to return products for recycling. Many states in the U.S. have similar e-waste take-back laws. Although these laws are typically targeted at the end electronic product and not the component products that Intel manufactures, the inconsistency of many e-waste take-back laws and the lack of local e-waste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts. Intel seeks to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers to improve energy efficiency. We take a holistic approach to power management, addressing the challenge at the silicon, package, circuit, micro/macro architecture, platform, and software levels. We recognize that climate change may cause general economic risk. For further information on the risks of climate change, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations. This could include items applied to utilities that are passed along to customers, such as carbon taxes or costs associated with obtaining permits for our U.S. manufacturing operations, emission cap and trade programs, or renewable portfolio standards. We are committed to sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives and working proactively with governments, environmental groups, and industry to promote global environmental sustainability. We believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the worlds environmental challenges, and we are joining forces with industry, business, and governments to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to combat climate change. We have been purchasing wind power and other forms of renewable energy at some of our major sites for several years. At the beginning of 2008, we announced plans to purchase renewable energy certificates under a multi-year contract. The purchase has placed Intel at the top of the EPAs Green Power Partnership for the past three years and was intended to help stimulate the market for green power, leading to additional generating capacity and, ultimately, lower costs.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END Fluctuations in demand for our products may harm our financial results and are difficult to forecast. If demand for our products fluctuates, our revenue and profitability could be harmed. Important factors that could cause demand for our products to fluctuate include: ##TABLE_START   changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in the semiconductor industry and/or the overall economy;   changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market, expectations for inflation, unemployment levels, and energy or other commodity prices;   changes in the level of customers components inventories;   competitive pressures, including pricing pressures, from companies that have competing products, chip architectures, manufacturing technologies, and marketing programs;   changes in customer product needs;   strategic actions taken by our competitors; and   market acceptance of our products. ##TABLE_END If product demand decreases, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to record an impairment on our long-lived assets, including facilities and equipment as well as intangible assets, which would increase our expenses. In addition, if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin. Factory-planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of long-lived assets, including facilities and equipment, and cause us to accelerate depreciation. In the long term, if product demand increases, we may not be able to add manufacturing or assembly and test capacity fast enough to meet market demand. These changes in demand for our products, and changes in our customers product needs, could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results, and, in certain cases, may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us to recognize impairments of our assets. The semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, and by product demand that is highly variable and subject to significant downturns that may harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized by high costs, such as those related to facility construction and equipment, RD, and employment and training of a highly skilled workforce, that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. At the same time, demand for our products is highly variable and there have been downturns, often in connection with maturing product cycles and general economic market conditions. These downturns have been characterized by reduced product demand, manufacturing overcapacity and resulting excess capacity charges, high inventory levels, and lower average selling prices. The combination of these factors may cause our revenue, gross margin, cash flow, and profitability to vary significantly in both the short and long term. We operate in intensely competitive industries, and our failure to respond quickly to technological developments and incorporate new features into our products could harm our ability to compete. We operate in intensely competitive industries that experience rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product introductions and improvements. If we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments, we may lose our competitive position, and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete. As new computing market segments emerge, such as netbooks, handhelds, tablets, and consumer electronics devices, we face new sources of competition, and customers that have different requirements than customers in our traditional PC business. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships in these market segments. As the number and variety of Internet-connected devices increase, we need to improve the cost, energy efficiency, and security functionality of our microprocessors to succeed in these new market segments. In addition, we need to focus on the acquisition and development of our software capabilities in order to provide customers with complete computing solutions. To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful RD effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes at the same pace or ahead of our competitors. Our RD efforts are aimed at solving increasingly complex problems, and we do not expect that all of our projects will be successful. If our RD efforts are unsuccessful, our future results of operations could be materially harmed. We may not be able to develop and market these new products successfully, the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers, and products developed and new technologies offered by others may affect demand for our products. These types of events could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results, such as reducing our revenue, increasing our costs, lowering our gross margin percentage, and requiring us to recognize impairments on our assets. Litigation or regulatory proceedings could harm our business. We may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. As described in Note 29: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we are currently engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of intellectual property. If we were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. Fluctuations in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results. Because of the wide price differences among and within notebook, netbook, tablet, desktop, and server microprocessors, the mix and types of performance capabilities of microprocessors sold affect the average selling price of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue and gross margin. Our financial results also depend in part on the mix of other products that we sell, such as chipsets, flash memory, and other semiconductor products. In addition, more recently introduced products tend to have higher associated costs because of initial overall development and production ramp. Fluctuations in the mix and types of our products may also affect the extent to which we are able to recover the fixed costs and investments associated with a particular product, and as a result can harm our financial results. Our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our results of operations and financial condition. We have sales offices, RD, manufacturing, and assembly and test facilities in many countries, and some business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas. As a result, we are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products in particular countries or on a geographic basis, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition, including: ##TABLE_START   security concerns, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, and terrorist activity;   health concerns;   natural disasters;   inefficient and limited infrastructure and disruptions, such as large-scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, or telecommunications providers and supply chain interruptions;   restrictions on our operations by governments seeking to support local industries, nationalization of our operations, and restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings;   differing employment practices and labor issues;   local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations; and   regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ among jurisdictions. ##TABLE_END Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies, controls, and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, or agents may violate our policies. In addition, although substantially all of our products are sold in U.S. dollars, we incur a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as conduct certain investing and financing activities, in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, fluctuations in exchange rates could harm our results and financial condition. In addition, changes in tariff and import regulations and in U.S. and non-U.S. monetary policies may harm our results and financial condition by increasing our expenses and reducing our revenue. Varying tax rates in different jurisdictions could harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our overall tax rate. We maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property, casualty, and other risks. We place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions. However, there is a risk that one or more of our insurance providers may be unable to pay a claim. The types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location, depending on availability, cost, and our decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis. Losses not covered by insurance may be substantial, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Failure to meet our production targets, resulting in undersupply or oversupply of products, may harm our business and results of operations. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. Disruptions in this process can result from interruptions in our processes, errors, and difficulties in our development and implementation of new processes; defects in materials; disruptions in our supply of materials or resources; and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to, for example, accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditionsall of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. We may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes. The occurrence of any of the foregoing may result in our failure to meet or increase production as desired, resulting in higher costs or substantial decreases in yields, which could affect our ability to produce sufficient volume to meet specific product demand. The unavailability or reduced availability of certain products could make it more difficult to deliver computing platforms. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business and results of operations. We may have difficulties obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing, assembling and testing our products, or operating other aspects of our business, which could harm our ability to meet demand for our products and may increase our costs. We have thousands of suppliers providing various materials that we use in the production of our products and other aspects of our business, and we seek, where possible, to have several sources of supply for all of those materials. However, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country, for these materials. The inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or could make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. In addition, production could be disrupted by the unavailability of the resources used in production, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. Future environmental regulations could restrict the supply or increase the cost of certain of the materials that we currently use in our business. Environmental regulations also may make it more difficult to obtain permits to build or modify additional manufacturing capacity to meet demand. The unavailability or reduced availability of the materials or resources that we use in our business may require us to reduce production of products or may require us to incur additional costs in order to obtain an adequate supply of those materials or resources. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business and results of operations. Costs related to product defects and errata may harm our results of operations and business. Costs associated with unexpected product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) due to, for example, unanticipated problems in our design and manufacturing processes, could include: ##TABLE_START   writing off the value of inventory of such products;   disposing of products that cannot be fixed;   recalling such products that have been shipped to customers;   providing product replacements for, or modifications to, such products; and   defending against litigation related to such products. ##TABLE_END These costs could be substantial and may therefore increase our expenses and lower our gross margin. In addition, our reputation with our customers or users of our products could be damaged as a result of such product defects and errata, and the demand for our products could be reduced. The announcement of product defects and/or errata could cause customers to purchase products from our competitors as a result of anticipated shortages of Intel components or for other reasons. These factors could harm our financial results and the prospects for our business. We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, which could harm our business. Third parties may assert against us or our customers alleged patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. We are currently engaged in a number of litigation matters involving intellectual property rights. We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals and companies, including those who have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of asserting such claims against other companies. Any claims that our products or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others, regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims, could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to, defending, and resolving such claims, and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business. As a result of such intellectual property infringement claims, we could be required or otherwise decide that it is appropriate to: ##TABLE_START   pay third-party infringement claims;   discontinue manufacturing, using, or selling particular products subject to infringement claims;   discontinue using the technology or processes subject to infringement claims;   develop other technology not subject to infringement claims, which could be time-consuming and costly or may not be possible; or   license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. ##TABLE_END The occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment of our assets, which would reduce the value of our assets and increase expenses. In addition, if we alter or discontinue our production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed. We may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business. Our ability to enforce our patents, copyrights, software licenses, and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid, is otherwise not enforceable, or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim. In addition, our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own or assert other claims against us, which could harm our business. If we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation, we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction, or we may have to license the technology or pay damages that could, in turn, harm our results of operations. In addition, governments may adopt regulations, and governments or courts may render decisions, requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others, or governments may require that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business. We may be subject to intellectual property theft or misuse, which could result in third-party claims and harm our business and results of operations. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet to our information technology systems, such as when they masquerade as authorized users or surreptitiously introduce software. These attempts, which might be the result of industrial or other espionage, or actions by hackers seeking to harm the company, its products, or end users, are sometimes successful. We seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce marketplace acceptance of our products; the value of our investment in RD, product development, and marketing could be reduced; and third parties might assert against us or our customers claims related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information or end-user data, or system reliability. Our business could be subject to significant disruption, and we could suffer monetary and other losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm, in the event of such incidents and claims. Our licenses with other companies and our participation in industry initiatives may allow other companies, including our competitors, to use our patent rights. Companies in the semiconductor industry often rely on the ability to license patents from each other in order to compete. Many of our competitors have broad licenses or cross-licenses with us, and under current case law, some of the licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others. If one of these licensees becomes a foundry, our competitors might be able to avoid our patent rights in manufacturing competing products. In addition, our participation in industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies that adopt certain industry standards or specifications, even when such organizations do not adopt standards or specifications proposed by us. As a result, our patents implicated by our participation in industry initiatives might not be available for us to enforce against others who might otherwise be deemed to be infringing those patents, our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our intellectual property may be impaired. We invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments. We make investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives. Such investments include equity or debt instruments of public or private companies, and many of these instruments are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. These companies range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The success of these companies is dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business factors. The companies in which we invest may fail because they may not be able to secure additional funding, obtain favorable investment terms for future financings, or participate in liquidity events such as public offerings, mergers, and private sales. If any of these private companies fail, we could lose all or part of our investment in that company. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an equity or debt investment in a public or private company in which we have invested, we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment loss. We also have significant investments in companies in the flash memory market segment, and declines in this market segment or changes in managements plans with respect to our investments in this market segment could result in significant impairment charges, impacting gains (losses) on equity method investments, net and gains (losses) on other equity investments, net. When the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved, or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives, we may decide to dispose of the investment. We may incur losses on the disposal of our non-marketable investments. Additionally, for cases in which we are required under equity method accounting to recognize a proportionate share of another companys income or loss, such income or loss may impact our earnings. Gains or losses from equity securities could vary from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities, gains or losses from equity method investments, and impairment charges for equity and other investments. Our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations (see Critical Accounting Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K). Such methods, estimates, and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates, and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates, and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations. Decisions about the scope of operations of our business could affect our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in the business environment could lead to changes in our decisions about the scope of operations of our business, and these changes could result in restructuring and asset impairment charges. Factors that could affect our results of operations and financial condition with regard to changing the scope of our operations include: ##TABLE_START   timing and execution of plans and programs that may be subject to local labor law requirements, including consultation with appropriate work councils;   changes in assumptions related to severance and postretirement costs;   future divestitures;   new business initiatives and changes in product roadmap, development, and manufacturing;   changes in employment levels and turnover rates;   changes in product demand and the business environment; and   changes in the fair value of certain long-lived assets. ##TABLE_END Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and enter into agreements regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions, such as joint ventures. Acquisitions and other transactions involve significant challenges and risks, including risks that: ##TABLE_START   we may not be able to identify suitable opportunities at terms acceptable to us;   the transaction may not advance our business strategy;   we may not realize a satisfactory return on the investment we make;   we may not be able to retain key personnel of the acquired business;   we may experience difficulty in integrating new employees, business systems, and technology;   acquired businesses may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations globally, and our due diligence process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities that are in existence at the time of our acquisition;   we may have difficulty entering into new market segments in which we are not experienced; or   we may be unable to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses following the acquisition. ##TABLE_END When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions. These circumstances could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to businesses that we want to dispose of, or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, resulting in a loss on the transaction. If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to factors such as: ##TABLE_START   failure to obtain required regulatory or other approvals;   intellectual property or other litigation; or   difficulties that we or other parties may encounter in obtaining financing for the transaction. ##TABLE_END In order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate key employees, and our failure to do so could harm our results of operations. In order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees in the semiconductor industry can be intense. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based incentive awards such as non-vested share units (restricted stock units) and employee stock options. If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. Our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations worldwide could harm our business and results of operations. The manufacturing and assembling and testing of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of EHS laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with any of those applicable laws or regulations could result in: ##TABLE_START   regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities;   suspension of production;   alteration of our fabrication and assembly and test processes; and   curtailment of our operations or sales. ##TABLE_END In addition, our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or future liabilities. Existing and future environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify our product designs, or incur other expenses associated with such laws and regulations. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under existing or future environmental laws and regulations that may restrict our use of one or more of such materials in our manufacturing, assembly and test processes, or products. Any of these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct our business. In addition to the possible direct economic impact that climate change could have on us, climate change mitigation programs and regulations can increase our costs. For example, the cost of perfluorocompounds (PFCs), a gas that we use in manufacturing, could increase over time under some climate-change-focused emissions trading programs that may be imposed by government regulation. If the use of PFCs is prohibited, we would need to obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. In addition, air quality permit requirements for our manufacturing operations could become more burdensome and cause delays in our ability to modify or build additional manufacturing capacity. Under the recently adopted greenhouse gas regulations in the U.S., many of our manufacturing facilities will become major sources under the Clean Air Act in 2011. At a minimum, this change in status will result in some uncertainty as the EPA adopts guidance on implementation of its greenhouse gas regulations. Due to the dynamic nature of our semiconductor manufacturing operations, it is likely these new regulations will result in increased costs for our U.S. operations. These cost increases could be associated with new air pollution control requirements, and increased or new monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. We also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations. Our costs could increase if utility companies pass on their costs, such as those associated with carbon taxes, emission cap and trade programs, or renewable portfolio standards. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disasters or events. Many of our operations are located in semi-arid regions, such as Israel and the southwestern U.S. Some scenarios predict that these regions may become even more vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. Changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations. A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including: ##TABLE_START   the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;   the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;   changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in deferred tax valuation allowances;   adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;   increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;   changes in available tax credits;   changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of foreign income and expenses;   changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and   our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. ##TABLE_END Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods. Interest and other, net could be impacted by macroeconomic and other factors, harming our results of operations. Factors that could cause interest and other, net in our consolidated statements of income to fluctuate include: ##TABLE_START   fixed-income, equity, and credit market volatility;   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;   fluctuations in interest rates;   changes in the credit standing of financial instrument counterparties; and   changes in our cash and investment balances. ##TABLE_END 19 ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

Outside the U.S., we have wafer fabrication at our facilities in Israel, Ireland, and China. Our assembly and test facilities are located in Malaysia, China, Costa Rica, and Vietnam. In addition, we have sales and marketing offices worldwide that are generally located near major concentrations of customers. With the exception of certain facilities placed for sale and/or facilities included in our restructuring actions, we believe that our facilities detailed above are suitable and adequate for our present purposes (see Note 19: Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Additionally, the productive capacity in our facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize it. We do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES ##TABLE_END Information regarding the market price range of Intel common stock and dividend information may be found in Financial Information by Quarter (Unaudited) in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. As of February 4, 2011, there were approximately 165,000 registered holders of record of Intels common stock. A substantially greater number of holders of Intel common stock are street name or beneficial holders, whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers, and other financial institutions. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities As of December 25, 2010, we had an ongoing authorization, amended in November 2005, from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $25 billion in shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions, and $4.2 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit. In January 2011, our Board of Directors increased the repurchase authorization limit by $10 billion. Common stock repurchases under our authorized plan in each quarter of 2010 were as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): ##TABLE_START              Total Number of Shares Purchased as Total Number of Average Price Part of Publicly Period Shares Purchased Paid Per Share Announced Plans December 27, 2009  March 27, 2010  $   March 28, 2010  June 26, 2010  $   June 27, 2010  September 25, 2010  $   September 26, 2010  December 25, 2010 70.3 $ 21.35 70.3 Total 70.3 $ 21.35 70.3 ##TABLE_END Our purchases in 2010 were executed in privately negotiated transactions. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. These withheld shares are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized plan and are not included in the common stock repurchase totals in the preceding table.

Overview of contractual obligations, contingent liabilities, commitments, and off-balance-sheet arrangements outstanding as of December 25, 2010, including expected payment schedule. ##TABLE_END The various sections of this MDA contain a number of forward-looking statements. Words such as expects, goals, plans, believes, continues, may, will, and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the Business Outlook section and in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially, and other than our expected completion of the McAfee acquisition in the first quarter of 2011 (see Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K), these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of February 18, 2011. Overview Our results of operations were as follows: ##TABLE_START                  Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec. 25, Sept. 25, Dec. 25, Dec. 26, (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2010 2010 2009 Net revenue $ 11,457 $ 11,102 $ 43,623 $ 35,127 Gross margin $ 7,406 $ 7,321 $ 28,491 $ 19,561 Gross margin percentage 64.6 % 65.9 % 65.3 % 55.7 % Operating income $ 4,023 $ 4,136 $ 15,588 $ 5,711 Net income $ 3,180 $ 2,955 $ 11,464 $ 4,369 ##TABLE_END 2010 was a record year for us. Strong market growth in the business and consumer PC market segments as well as the continued build-out of the data center, the leadership of our product portfolio, and improvements to our cost structure all contributed to the most profitable year in our history. Revenue increased 24% in 2010 compared to 2009. Our 2010 gross margin percentage of 65.3% increased by 9.6 percentage points from 2009, primarily driven by lower factory underutilization charges, higher microprocessor average selling prices, lower platform (microprocessor and chipset) unit cost, and higher platform unit sales. We expect continued strength in emerging markets coupled with the build-out of the cloud computing infrastructure to contribute toward a 2011 revenue growth percentage in the mid- to high-teens. This expectation is also inclusive of the recently completed acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon and the expected acquisition of McAfee in the first quarter of 2011. In the fourth quarter, we achieved record quarterly revenue for the third quarter in a row despite continuation of the softness we saw in the consumer segments of mature markets starting in the middle of the year. The sequential decrease in our fourth quarter gross margin percentage was primarily driven by charges to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel  6 Series Express Chipset family (see Note 20: Chipset Design Issue in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K), increased costs associated with taking older technology offline, and higher start-up costs. These impacts were partially offset by the qualification for sale of our 2nd generation Intel  Core tm processor products (formerly code-named Sandy Bridge), resulting in lower microprocessor inventory write-offs and sales of previously written-off products, and higher platform average selling prices. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As we enter 2011, the strength of our product portfolio is highlighted with the launch of 32nm process technology products based on our 2nd generation Intel Core processor microarchitecture. We continue to deliver improvements in our product offerings through our tick-tock technology development cadence. We plan to invest $9.0 billion in capital assets in 2011 as we build and equip our 22nm process technology manufacturing capacity, which will increase our leading-edge facilities to four. This increase in capital spending will enable us to take advantage of the significant market growth opportunities that we believe exist for our products across the computing spectrum, as well as move more transistors to our leading-edge process technologies. The cash-generating power of our business was evident in 2010 with $16.7 billion of cash from operations. From a financial condition perspective, we ended 2010 with an investment portfolio of $21.5 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets. During 2010, we purchased $5.2 billion in capital assets, returned $3.5 billion to stockholders through dividends, and repurchased $1.5 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. In January 2011, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.1812 per common share for the first quarter of 2011, an increase of approximately 15% compared to our fourth quarter dividend, and increased the repurchase authorization limit of our common stock repurchase program by $10 billion. During 2010, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire McAfee for approximately $7.68 billion, and we expect to complete the acquisition in the first quarter of 2011. For further information, see Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. In the first quarter of 2011, we completed the acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon. Total net cash consideration for the acquisition is estimated at $1.4 billion. For further information, see Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In January 2011, we entered into a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA. Under the agreement, we receive a license to all of NVIDIAs patents, while NVIDIA products are licensed to our patents subject to exclusions for x86 products, certain chipsets, and certain flash memory technology products. The agreement also includes settlement of the existing litigation between the companies as well as broad mutual general releases. We agreed to make payments to NVIDIA totaling $1.5 billion over six years. For further information, see Note 29: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Strategy Our goal is to be the preeminent computing solutions company that powers the worldwide digital economy. We believe that the proliferation of the Internet and cloud computing have driven fundamental changes in the computing industry. We are transforming from a company with a primary focus on the design and manufacture of semiconductor chips for PCs and servers to a computing company that delivers complete solutions in the form of hardware and software platforms and supporting services. The number and variety of devices connected to the Internet is growing, and computing is becoming an increasingly personal experience. End users value consistency across devices that connect seamlessly and effortlessly to the Internet and to each other. We will help to enable this experience by innovating around three pillars of computing: energy-efficient performance, connectivity, and security. ##TABLE_START   Energy-Efficient Performance. We are focusing on improved energy-efficient performance for computing and communications systems and devices. Improved energy-efficient performance involves balancing higher performance with lower power consumption.   Connectivity. We are positioning our business to take advantage of the growth in devices that compute and connect to the Internet. In the first quarter of 2011, we acquired the WLS business of Infineon. This acquisition enables us to offer a portfolio of products that covers a broad range of wireless connectivity options by combining the Intel  WiFi and Intel  WiMAX technologies with WLS 2G and 3G technologies, and creates a combined path to accelerate industry adoption of 4G LTE.   Security. Our goal is to enhance security features through a combination of hardware and software solutions. This may include identity protection and fraud deterrence; detection and prevention of malware; securing data and assets; as well as system recovery and enhanced security patching. We expect to complete the acquisition of McAfee in the first quarter of 2011. We believe that this acquisition will accelerate and enhance our hardware and software security solutions, improving the overall security of our platforms. ##TABLE_END 25 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) To succeed in the changing computing environment, we have the following key objectives: ##TABLE_START   Strive to ensure that Intel technology remains the best choice for the PC as well as cloud computing and the data center.   Expand platforms into adjacent market segments to bring compelling new solutions to the smartphone, the tablet, the TV, the car, and the rest of the embedded world.   Enable devices that connect to the Internet and to each other to create a continuum of personal computing. This continuum would give consumers a set of secure, consistent, and personalized computing experiences.   Positively impact the world through our actions and the application of our energy-efficient technology. ##TABLE_END We will use our core assets to meet these objectives. Our core assets include our silicon and process technology, our architecture and platforms, our global presence, our strong relationships across the industry, and our brand recognition. We believe that applying these core assets to our key focus areas provides us with the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers needs quickly. Some of our core assets and key focus areas are: ##TABLE_START   Silicon and Manufacturing Technology Leadership. We have long been a leader in silicon process technology and manufacturing, and we aim to continue our lead through investment and innovation in this critical area. We drive a regular two-year upgrade cycleintroducing a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramping the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. We refer to this as our tick-tock technology development cadence. As we continue to drive Moores Law over the next several years, we believe that the value of this advantage will increase. We aim to have the best process technology, and unlike most semiconductor companies, we primarily manufacture our products in our own facilities. This allows us to optimize performance, reduce our time to market, and scale new products more rapidly.   Architecture and Platforms. We are now developing a wide range of solutions for devices that span the computing continuum, from PCs and smartphones to smart TVs and in-vehicle infotainment systems and beyond. Users want computing experiences that are consistent and devices that are interoperable. Users and developers value consistency of architecture, which provides a common framework that allows for reduced time to market, with the ability to leverage technologies across multiple form factors. We believe that we can meet the needs of both users and developers by offering Intel  architecture-based computing solutions across the computing continuum. We continue to invest in improving Intel architecture so that we can deliver increased value to our customers in existing market segments and also expand the capabilities of the architecture to meet end-user and customer needs in adjacent market segments. Increasingly, we are delivering our architecture in the form of platforms. Platforms include not only the microprocessor, but other critical hardware and software ingredients that are necessary to create computing solutions. We are expanding our platform capabilities with connectivity solutions, new types of user interfaces, new features and capabilities, and complementary software.   Software. We enable and advance the computing ecosystem by providing development tools and support to help software developers create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platforms. We seek to expedite growth in various market segments, such as the embedded and handheld market segments, through our software offerings. Additionally, we have collaborated with other companies to develop software platforms optimized for our Intel  Atom tm processors and that support multiple hardware architectures as well as multiple operating systems.   Customer Orientation. Our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of products based on the needs and expectations of our customers. In turn, our products help enable the design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers. We offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured to work together to provide an optimized solution compared to components that are used separately. Additionally, we promote industry standards that we believe will yield innovation and improved technologies for users.   Strategic Investments. We make investments in companies around the world that we believe will generate financial returns, further our strategic objectives, and support our key business initiatives. Our investments, including those made through our Intel Capital program, generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital economy, create new business opportunities for Intel, and expand global markets for our products.   Stewardship. We are committed to developing energy-efficient technology solutions that can be used to address major global problems while reducing our environmental impact. We are also committed to helping transform education globally through our technology, program, and policy leadership, as well as funding through the Intel Foundation. In addition, we strive to cultivate a work environment where engaged, energized employees can thrive in their jobs and in their communities. ##TABLE_END Our continued investment in developing our assets and execution on key focus areas will strengthen our competitive position as we enter and expand into new market segments. We believe that these new market segments will result in demand that is incremental to that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers. We also believe that increased Internet traffic and use of cloud computing create a need for greater server infrastructure, including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance and virtualization. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Strategy by Major Market Segment The strategy for our PC Client Group operating segment is to offer products that are incorporated into notebook, netbook, tablet, and desktop computers for consumers and businesses. ##TABLE_START   Our strategy for the notebook computing market segment is to offer notebook PC products designed to improve performance, battery life, and wireless connectivity, as well as to allow for the design of smaller, lighter, and thinner form factors. We are also increasing our focus on notebook products designed to offer technologies that provide increased manageability and security. In addition, we are focusing on providing seamless connectivity within our platforms through the use and development of multi-communication technologies such as WiMAX, WiFi, and 4G LTE.   Our strategy for the netbook computing market segment is to offer products that enable customization and affordable Internet-focused devices with small form factors. We also are focusing on offering performance capabilities and features that allow for enhanced end-user experiences such as seamless connectivity, improved synchronization of content between devices, and enhanced media usage.   Our strategy for the tablet computing market segment is to offer Intel Atom processor-based solutions for multiple operating systems that are designed to provide enhanced performance and seamless connectivity to the Internet and other devices. Tablets provide a unique form factor for multiple operating systems and a unique user interface, including multi-touch features.   Our strategy for the desktop computing market segment is to offer products that provide increased manageability, security, and energy-efficient performance while lowering total cost of ownership for businesses. For consumers in the desktop computing market segment, we also focus on the design of components for high-end enthusiast PCs and mainstream PCs with rich audio and video capabilities. ##TABLE_END The strategy for our Data Center Group operating segment is to offer products that provide leading performance, energy efficiency, and virtualization technology for server, workstation, and storage platforms. We are also increasing our focus on products designed for high-performance and mission-critical computing, cloud computing services, and emerging markets. In addition, we offer wired connectivity devices that are incorporated into products that make up the infrastructure for the Internet. The strategies for our other Intel architecture operating segments include: ##TABLE_START   driving Intel architecture as a solution for embedded applications by delivering long life-cycle support, software and architectural scalability, and platform integration;   continuing to develop and offer products that enable handheld devices to deliver digital content and the Internet to users in new ways; and   offering products and solutions for use in consumer electronics devices designed to access and share Internet, broadcast, optical media, and personal content through a variety of linked digital devices within the home, including the TV. ##TABLE_END Critical Accounting Estimates The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: ##TABLE_START   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity method investments, net, or gains (losses) on other equity investments, net when we record impairments;   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation;   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes;   the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and   the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment. ##TABLE_END Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Non-Marketable Equity Investments We regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $2.6 billion as of December 25, 2010 ($3.4 billion as of December 26, 2009). The majority of this balance as of December 25, 2010 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment. Our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in IM Flash Technologies, LLC (IMFT) and IM Flash Singapore, LLP (IMFS) of $1.5 billion ($1.6 billion as of December 26, 2009). For additional information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. Our non-marketable equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success is dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, other key business factors, and the ability of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile. The companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings. These events could cause our investments to become impaired. In addition, financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. For further information about our investment portfolio risks, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as projected revenues, earnings, and comparable performance multiples. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies sizes, growth rates, industries, development stages, and other relevant factors. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee: revenue, based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share; expenses, capital spending, and other costs; and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of market segment size, market segment share, expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed by the investee and/or Intel using historical data and available market data. The valuation of our non-marketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, the investees capital structure, and the terms of the investees issued interests. For non-marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment, such as: ##TABLE_START   the investees revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects;   the technological feasibility of the investees products and technologies;   the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes;   factors related to the investees ability to remain in business, such as the investees liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and   the investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. ##TABLE_END If the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal. If the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value. Impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $125 million in 2010. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2010, impairments of non-marketable equity investments ranged from $11 million to $896 million per quarter. This range included impairments of $896 million during the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily related to a $762 million impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC). MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) IMFT/IMFS IMFT and IMFS are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell NAND products to Intel and Micron at manufacturing cost. We determine the fair value of our investment in IMFT/IMFS using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our NAND Solutions Group business, which requires the use of unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs that require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments are the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate. Changes in management estimates for these unobservable inputs have the most significant effect on the fair value determination. We have not had an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in IMFT/IMFS. Long-Lived Assets We assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset groupings carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset groupings carrying value and its fair value. Long-lived assets such as goodwill; intangible assets; and property, plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets, and are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. Impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets new, shorter useful lives. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2010, impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $10 million to $300 million per quarter. Income Taxes We must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity, and effectively settled issues. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Inventory The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. The estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. As of December 25, 2010, we had total work-in-process inventory of $1.9 billion and total finished goods inventory of $1.4 billion. The demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin. In order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory, and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Over the past 12 quarters, excess capacity charges ranged from zero to $680 million per quarter. Loss Contingencies We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and asserted and potential claims, accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments (loss contingencies) that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. The outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims, and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments, are subject to significant uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. With respect to estimating the losses associated with repairing and replacing parts in connection with product errata, we make judgments with respect to customer return rates, costs to repair or replace parts, and where the product is in our customers manufacturing process. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter, and we may revise our estimates. These revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Accounting Changes and Recent Accounting Standards For a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3: Accounting Changes and Note 4: Recent Accounting Standards in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated: ##TABLE_START                          2010 2009 2008 % of Net % of Net % of Net (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Dollars Revenue Dollars Revenue Dollars Revenue Net revenue $ 43,623 100.0 % $ 35,127 100.0 % $ 37,586 100.0 % Cost of sales 15,132 34.7 % 15,566 44.3 % 16,742 44.5 % Gross margin 28,491 65.3 % 19,561 55.7 % 20,844 55.5 % Research and development 6,576 15.1 % 5,653 16.1 % 5,722 15.2 % Marketing, general and administrative 6,309 14.5 % 7,931 22.6 % 5,452 14.6 % Restructuring and asset impairment charges   % 231 0.6 % 710 1.9 % Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 18  % 35 0.1 % 6  % Operating income 15,588 35.7 % 5,711 16.3 % 8,954 23.8 % Gains (losses) on equity method investments, net 117 0.3 % (147 ) (0.4 )% (1,380 ) (3.7 )% Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net 231 0.5 % (23 ) (0.1 )% (376 ) (1.0 )% Interest and other, net 109 0.3 % 163 0.4 % 488 1.3 % Income before taxes 16,045 36.8 % 5,704 16.2 % 7,686 20.4 % Provision for taxes 4,581 10.5 % 1,335 3.8 % 2,394 6.3 % Net income $ 11,464 26.3 % $ 4,369 12.4 % $ 5,292 14.1 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 2.01 $ 0.77 $ 0.92 ##TABLE_END Geographic Breakdown of Revenue Our net revenue for 2010 increased $8.5 billion, or 24%, compared to 2009. The increase was due to higher microprocessor and chipset unit sales, as well as higher microprocessor average selling prices. Revenue in the Japan, Asia-Pacific, Americas, and Europe regions increased by 31%, 29%, 21%, and 6%, respectively, compared to 2009. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our overall gross margin dollars for 2010 increased $8.9 billion, or 46%, compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. To a lesser extent, excess capacity charges recorded in 2009 of $1.1 billion and lower platform (microprocessor and chipset) unit cost contributed to the increase in gross margin dollars for 2010 compared to 2009. These increases were partially offset by charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel  6 Series Express Chipset family. For further information, see Note 20: Chipset Design Issue in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our overall gross margin percentage increased to 65.3% in 2010 from 55.7% in 2009. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increase in the PC Client Group operating segment and, to a lesser extent, gross margin percentage increases in the Data Center Group and NAND Solutions Group operating segments. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2010 and 2009 from the sale of microprocessors in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. See Business Outlook for a discussion of gross margin expectations. Our net revenue for 2009 decreased 7% compared to 2008. Average selling prices for microprocessors and chipsets decreased and microprocessor and chipset unit sales increased, compared to 2008, primarily due to the ramp of Intel Atom processors and chipsets, which generally have lower average selling prices than our other microprocessor and chipset products. Revenue from the sale of NOR flash memory products and communications products declined $740 million, primarily as a result of business divestitures. Additionally, an increase in revenue from the sale of NAND flash memory products was mostly offset by a decrease in revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity products. Revenue in the Asia-Pacific region increased 2% compared to 2008, while revenue in the Europe, Japan, and Americas regions decreased by 26%, 15%, and 4%, respectively, compared to 2008. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2009 decreased $1.3 billion, or 6%, compared to 2008. The decrease was due to lower revenue, approximately $830 million of higher factory underutilization charges, and approximately $330 million of higher start-up costs. These decreases were partially offset by lower platform unit cost and lower NAND flash memory unit cost. Our overall gross margin percentage increased slightly to 55.7% in 2009 from 55.5% in 2008. The slight increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increases in the NAND Solutions Group and Data Center Group operating segments, offset by the gross margin percentage decrease in the PC Client Group operating segment. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2009, and most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2008, from the sales of microprocessors in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. PC Client Group The revenue and operating income for the PC Client Group (PCCG) for the three years ended December 25, 2010 were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Microprocessor revenue $ 24,721 $ 19,914 $ 21,516 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 6,877 6,261 6,450 Net revenue $ 31,598 $ 26,175 $ 27,966 Operating income $ 13,304 $ 7,585 $ 9,419 ##TABLE_END Net revenue for the PCCG operating segment increased by $5.4 billion, or 21%, in 2010 compared to 2009. Microprocessors and chipsets within PCCG include those designed for the notebook, netbook, and desktop computing market segments. Significantly higher notebook unit sales were the primary driver for the increase in microprocessor revenue. To a lesser extent, higher notebook average selling prices and higher desktop unit sales also contributed to the increase. The increase in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due to significantly higher chipset unit sales, partially offset by significantly lower revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity products. Operating income increased by $5.7 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. During 2009, PCCG recognized approximately $1.0 billion of excess capacity charges, primarily related to microprocessors and chipsets. Additionally, lower platform unit cost in 2010 contributed to the increase in operating income. These impacts were partially offset by charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel  6 Series Express Chipset family. Additionally, operating expenses in 2010 were higher compared to 2009. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) For 2009, net revenue for the PCCG operating segment decreased by $1.8 billion, or 6%, compared to 2008. The decrease in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to lower notebook microprocessor average selling prices, and lower desktop microprocessor unit sales and average selling prices. These decreases were partially offset by a significant increase in netbook microprocessor unit sales due to the ramp of Intel Atom processors. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset average selling prices and lower unit sales of wireless connectivity products, partially offset by higher chipset unit sales. Operating income decreased by $1.8 billion, or 19%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue and approximately $810 million of higher factory underutilization charges, partially offset by lower platform unit cost. Data Center Group The revenue and operating income for the Data Center Group (DCG) for the three years ended December 25, 2010 were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Microprocessor revenue $ 7,361 $ 5,301 $ 5,126 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 1,332 1,149 1,464 Net revenue $ 8,693 $ 6,450 $ 6,590 Operating income $ 4,395 $ 2,299 $ 2,135 ##TABLE_END Net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased by $2.2 billion, or 35%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to significantly higher microprocessor unit sales and, to a lesser extent, higher microprocessor average selling prices. The increase in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due to significantly higher chipset unit sales and significantly higher revenue from the sale of wired connectivity products. Operating income increased by $2.1 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in operating income was due to significantly higher revenue and, to a lesser extent, lower chipset unit cost. For 2009, net revenue for the DCG operating segment decreased slightly by $140 million, or 2%, compared to 2008. The increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor average selling prices, partially offset by lower microprocessor unit sales. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset average selling prices. Operating income increased by $164 million, or 8%, compared to 2008. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher microprocessor revenue and lower operating expenses, partially offset by approximately $150 million of higher start-up costs as well as lower chipset revenue. Other Intel Architecture Operating Segments The revenue and operating income for the other Intel architecture (Other IA) operating segments, including the Embedded and Communications Group (ECG), the Digital Home Group, and the Ultra-Mobility Group, for the three years ended December 25, 2010 were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net revenue $ 1,784 $ 1,402 $ 1,763 Operating income (loss) $ (60 ) $ (179 ) $ (63 ) ##TABLE_END Net revenue for the Other IA operating segments increased by $382 million, or 27%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue within ECG from significantly higher microprocessor and chipset unit sales. Operating loss decreased by $119 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The operating loss decrease was primarily due to significantly higher ECG revenue and lower ECG unit cost, partially offset by higher operating expenses in ECG and the Ultra-Mobility Group. For 2009, net revenue for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $361 million, or 20%, compared to 2008, and operating loss for the Other IA operating segments increased by $116 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The changes were primarily due to lower revenue from the sale of communications products within ECG, primarily as a result of business divestitures. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three years ended December 25, 2010 were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Research and development $ 6,576 $ 5,653 $ 5,722 Marketing, general and administrative $ 6,309 $ 7,931 $ 5,452 Restructuring and asset impairment charges $  $ 231 $ 710 Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles $ 18 $ 35 $ 6 ##TABLE_END Research and Development. RD spending increased by $923 million, or 16%, in 2010 compared to 2009, and was flat in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher profit-dependent compensation, an increase in employees, and higher process development costs as we transitioned from manufacturing start-up costs related to our 32nm process technology to RD of our next-generation 22nm process technology. In 2009 compared to 2008, we had lower process development costs as we transitioned from RD to manufacturing using our 32nm process technology. This decrease was offset by higher profit-dependent compensation. Marketing, General and Administrative. Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased $1.6 billion, or 20%, in 2010 compared to 2009, and increased $2.5 billion, or 45%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease in 2010 was due to the 2009 charge of $1.447 billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the European Commission (EC) and the $1.25 billion payment to AMD in 2009 as part of a settlement agreement. These decreases were partially offset by higher advertising expenses (including cooperative advertising expenses), higher profit-dependent compensation, and, to a lesser extent, expenses related to our Wind River Software Group operating segment and an expense of $100 million recognized during the fourth quarter of 2010 due to a patent cross-license agreement that we entered into with NVIDIA in January 2011 (see Note 29: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). The increase in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the 2009 charge incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the EC and the payment to AMD in 2009 as part of a settlement agreement. To a lesser extent, we had higher profit-dependent compensation expenses that were partially offset by lower advertising expenses (including cooperative advertising expenses). RD, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 30% of net revenue in 2010, 39% of net revenue in 2009, and 30% of net revenue in 2008. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. The following table summarizes restructuring and asset impairment charges by plan for the three years ended December 25, 2010: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 2009 restructuring program $  $ 215 $  2008 NAND plan   215 2006 efficiency program  16 495 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $  $ 231 $ 710 ##TABLE_END 2009 Restructuring Program In the first quarter of 2009, management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing and assembly and test operations. These plans included closing two assembly and test facilities in Malaysia, one facility in the Philippines, and one facility in China; stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Oregon; and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in California. The 2009 restructuring program is complete. The following table summarizes charges for the 2009 restructuring program for the two years ended December 25, 2010: ##TABLE_START          (In Millions) 2010 2009 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $  $ 208 Asset impairments  7 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $  $ 215 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2009 restructuring program during 2009 and 2010: ##TABLE_START              Employee Severance and Asset (In Millions) Benefits Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2008 $  $  $  Additional accruals 223 7 230 Adjustments (15 )  (15 ) Cash payments (182 )  (182 ) Non-cash settlements  (7 ) (7 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2009 $ 26 $  $ 26 Additional accruals    Adjustments    Cash payments (26 )  (26 ) Non-cash settlements    Accrued restructuring balance as of December 25, 2010 $  $  $  ##TABLE_END Under the 2009 restructuring program, we incurred $208 million of charges related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 6,500 employees. Most of these employee actions occurred within manufacturing. We estimate that these employee severance and benefit charges result in gross annual savings of approximately $290 million. We are realizing a substantial majority of these savings within cost of sales. 2008 NAND Plan In the fourth quarter of 2008, management approved a plan with Micron to discontinue the supply of NAND flash memory from the 200mm facility within the IMFT manufacturing network. The agreement resulted in a $215 million restructuring charge, primarily related to the IMFT 200mm supply agreement. The restructuring charge resulted in a reduction of our investment in IMFT/IMFS of $184 million, a cash payment to Micron of $24 million, and other cash payments of $7 million. The 2008 NAND plan was completed at the end of 2008. 2006 Efficiency Program In the third quarter of 2006, management approved several actions as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results. The following table summarizes charges for the 2006 efficiency program for the three years ended December 25, 2010: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $  $ 8 $ 151 Asset impairments  8 344 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $  $ 16 $ 495 ##TABLE_END During 2006, as part of our assessment of our worldwide manufacturing capacity operations, we placed for sale our fabrication facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. As a result of placing the facility for sale, in 2006 we recorded a $214 million impairment charge to write down to fair value the land, building, and equipment. We incurred $54 million in additional asset impairment charges as a result of market conditions related to the Colorado Springs facility during 2007 and additional charges in 2008. We sold the Colorado Springs facility in 2009. We incurred $85 million in asset impairment charges related to assets that we sold in conjunction with the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business in 2007 and an additional $275 million in 2008. We determined the impairment charges based on the fair value, less selling costs, that we expected to receive upon completion of the divestiture in 2007, and determined the impairment charges based on the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable that we received upon completion of the divestiture, less selling costs, in 2008. For further information on this divestiture, see Note 16: Divestitures in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2006 efficiency program during 2009: ##TABLE_START              Employee Severance and Asset (In Millions) Benefits Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2008 $ 57 $  $ 57 Additional accruals 18 8 26 Adjustments (10 )  (10 ) Cash payments (65 )  (65 ) Non-cash settlements  (8 ) (8 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2009 $  $  $  ##TABLE_END The 2006 efficiency program is complete. From the third quarter of 2006 through 2009, we incurred a total of $1.6 billion in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this program. These charges included a total of $686 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for 11,300 employees. A substantial majority of these employee actions affected employees within manufacturing, information technology, and marketing. The restructuring and asset impairment charges also included $896 million in asset impairment charges. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation totaled $917 million in 2010 ($889 million in 2009 and $851 million in 2008). Share-based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses. As of December 25, 2010, unrecognized share-based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows: ##TABLE_START          Unrecognized Share-Based Weighted Compensation Average (Dollars in Millions) Costs Period Stock options $ 220 1.2 years Restricted stock units $ 1,210 1.3 years Stock purchase plan $ 13 1 month ##TABLE_END Gains (Losses) on Equity Method Investments, Net Gains (losses) on equity method investments, net were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Equity method losses, net $ (113 ) $ (131 ) $ (316 ) Impairment charges (16 ) (42 ) (1,077 ) Other, net 246 26 13 Total gains (losses) on equity method investments, net $ 117 $ (147 ) $ (1,380 ) ##TABLE_END We recognized higher gains on sales, lower impairment charges, and lower equity method losses in 2010 compared to 2009. During 2010, we recognized a gain of $33 million on the initial public offering of SMART Technologies, Inc., included within Equity method losses, net, and a gain of $148 million on the subsequent sale of our shares in the secondary offering, included in Other, net, resulting in a total gain of $181 million. We also recognized a gain of $91 million on the sale of our ownership interest in Numonyx B.V., included in Other, net. Equity method losses, net also includes Clearwire LLC ($116 million loss in 2010 and $27 million loss in 2009), Numonyx ($42 million gain in 2010, $31 million loss in 2009, and $87 million loss in 2008), and Clearwire Corporation ($184 million loss in 2008). For further information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Impairment charges in 2008 included a $762 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Clearwire LLC and a $250 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Numonyx. We recognized the impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire LLC to write down our investment to its fair value, primarily due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment in the fourth quarter of 2008. The impairment charge on our investment in Numonyx was due to a general decline in 2008 in the NOR flash memory market segment. See Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Gains (Losses) on Other Equity Investments, Net Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Impairment charges $ (109 ) $ (179 ) $ (455 ) Gains on sales, net 185 55 60 Other, net 155 101 19 Total gains (losses) on other equity investments, net $ 231 $ (23 ) $ (376 ) ##TABLE_END We recognized higher gains on third-party merger transactions, primarily related to our cost method investments; higher gains on sales; and lower impairment charges in 2010 compared to 2009. Gains on other equity investments in 2010 included a gain of $67 million on the sale of shares in Micron, which occurred in the first quarter of 2010. Impairment charges in 2008 included a $176 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Clearwire Corporation and $97 million of impairment charges on our investment in Micron. The impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire Corporation was due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008. The impairment charges on our investment in Micron reflected the difference between our cost basis and the fair value of our investment in Micron at the end of the second and third quarters of 2008. In addition, we recognized higher gains on equity derivatives in 2009 compared to 2008. Interest and Other, Net The components of interest and other, net were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Interest income $ 119 $ 168 $ 592 Interest expense  (1 ) (8 ) Other, net (10 ) (4 ) (96 ) Total interest and other, net $ 109 $ 163 $ 488 ##TABLE_END Interest income was lower in 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances. The average interest rate earned during 2010 decreased by approximately 0.5 percentage points compared to 2009. In addition, lower fair value gains on our trading assets (zero in 2010 and $70 million in 2009) were partially offset by lower exchange rate losses (zero in 2010 and $40 million in 2009). Exchange rate losses in 2009 were due to euro exposure related to our euro-denominated liability for the EC fine. We recognized lower interest income in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of lower interest rates. The average interest rate earned during 2009 decreased by 2.4 percentage points compared to 2008. In addition, lower gains on divestitures (zero in 2009 and $59 million in 2008) were more than offset by $70 million of fair value gains in 2009 on our trading assets, compared to $130 million of fair value losses in 2008. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Provision for Taxes Our provision for taxes and effective tax rate were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Income before taxes $ 16,045 $ 5,704 $ 7,686 Provision for taxes $ 4,581 $ 1,335 $ 2,394 Effective tax rate 28.6 % 23.4 % 31.1 % ##TABLE_END We generated a higher percentage of our profits from higher tax jurisdictions in 2010 compared to 2009, negatively impacting our effective tax rate for 2010. The effective tax rate for 2009 was positively impacted by the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $366 million on settlements, effective settlements, and related remeasurements of various uncertain tax positions. These impacts were partially offset by the recognition of the EC fine of $1.447 billion in 2009, which was not tax deductible and therefore significantly increased our effective tax rate for 2009. For further information on the EC fine, see Note 29: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2009 compared to 2008, positively impacting our effective tax rate for 2009. In addition, the 2009 tax rate was positively impacted by the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $366 million on settlements, effective settlements, and related remeasurements of various uncertain tax positions compared to a reversal of $103 million for such matters in 2008. These impacts were partially offset by the recognition of the EC fine. In addition, our 2008 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing tax benefits related to impairments of our equity investments. Business Outlook Our future results of operations and the topics of other forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, including this MDA, involve a number of risks and uncertaintiesin particular: ##TABLE_START   changes in business and economic conditions;   revenue and pricing;   gross margin and costs;   pending legal proceedings;   our effective tax rate;   marketing, general and administrative expenses;   our goals and strategies;   new product introductions, and product defects and errata; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   plans to cultivate new businesses;   RD expenses;   divestitures, acquisitions, or similar transactions;   net gains (losses) from equity investments;   interest and other, net;   capital spending;   depreciation; and   impairment of investments. ##TABLE_END Our business outlook incorporates financial projections and assumptions concerning the performance of McAfee, which we expect to acquire in the first quarter of 2011, and the recently acquired WLS business of Infineon (see Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Because we are required to make a number of assumptions about the future performance of these businesses, it may be more difficult to accurately project our financial results. Some of these assumptions include the prospects for the acquired businesses products and markets, the ability to retain customer relationships and key employees, successful integration of key technologies or operations, and the potential for unexpected liabilities. In addition, as we integrate these businesses into our operations, our understanding of the financial and operational performance of the acquired businesses may change, which could require an update to our business outlook. Our business outlook contains forward-looking statements and projections based upon estimates of the impact of the chipset design issue related to our Intel 6 Series Express Chipset family (see Note 20: Chipset Design Issue in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) on our future financial and operating results, including on revenue, gross margin, and inventory valuation, based on our preliminary analysis. Among the factors related to the chipset design issue that could cause actual results to differ are the number of units that may be affected, the impact on systems in the market, the costs that we may incur in repairing or replacing impacted components, the extent to which customers purchase parts from our competitors as a result of our parts shortages or otherwise, the extent of shipments of impacted chipsets for use in PC system configurations that would not be impacted by the design issue, and the extent to which we are able to increase production of substitute or redesigned parts for customers. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our expectations for 2011 are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Revenue. We expect a 2011 revenue growth percentage in the mid- to high-teens.   Gross Margin Percentage. 63%, plus or minus a few percentage points. The 63% midpoint is lower compared to our 2010 gross margin of 65.3%, primarily due to higher manufacturing period costs, mostly start-up costs, as well as the impacts of the recently completed acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon and the expected acquisition of McAfee in the first quarter of 2011. We expect these decreases to be partially offset by lower platform unit cost and higher platform revenue.   Total Spending. We expect spending on RD, plus marketing, general and administrative expenses, in 2011 to be approximately $15.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million, compared to $12.9 billion in 2010.   Research and Development Spending. Approximately $8.2 billion compared to $6.6 billion in 2010 as we continue to ramp our new 22nm process technology.   Capital Spending. $9.0 billion, plus or minus $300 million, compared to $5.2 billion in 2010. We expect capital spending for 2011 to primarily consist of investments in 22nm process technology.   Depreciation. Approximately $5.0 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared to $4.4 billion in 2010.   Tax Rate. Approximately 29%, flat compared to 29% in 2010. The estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect as of December 25, 2010 and expected income. ##TABLE_END Status of Business Outlook We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet privately with investors, investment analysts, the media, and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the Business Outlook section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. At the same time, we will keep this Form 10-K and our most current business outlook publicly available on our Investor Relations web site at www.intc.com . The public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on our web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we publish a notice stating otherwise. The statements in the Business Outlook section and other forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times. From the close of business on March 4, 2011 until our quarterly earnings release is published, presently scheduled for April 19, 2011, we will observe a quiet period. During the quiet period, the Business Outlook section and other forward-looking statements first published in our Form 8-K filed on January 13, 2011, as updated in our Form 8-K filed on January 31, 2011, and as reiterated or updated as applicable in this Form 10-K, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. During the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations. The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources ##TABLE_START          Dec. 25, Dec. 26, (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt instruments included in trading assets, and short-term investments $ 21,497 $ 13,920 Loans receivable and other long-term investments $ 3,876 $ 4,528 Short-term and long-term debt $ 2,115 $ 2,221 Debt as % of stockholders equity 4.3 % 5.3 % ##TABLE_END Sources and Uses of Cash (In Millions) In summary, our cash flows were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 16,692 $ 11,170 $ 10,926 Net cash used for investing activities (10,539 ) (7,965 ) (5,865 ) Net cash used for financing activities (4,642 ) (2,568 ) (9,018 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,511 $ 637 $ (3,957 ) ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. For 2010 compared to 2009, the $5.5 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to higher net income, partially offset by adjustments for non-cash items. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2010 compared to 2009 were $3.7 billion higher, primarily due to higher income before taxes in 2010. Changes in assets and liabilities as of December 25, 2010 compared to December 26, 2009 included the following: ##TABLE_START   Inventories increased due to higher microprocessor inventory, primarily due to ramping new products.   Accounts receivable increased due to a higher proportion of sales at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010.   Accounts payable increased due to timing of payments. ##TABLE_END For 2010 and 2009, our two largest customers accounted for 38% of our net revenue, with one of these customers accounting for 21% of our net revenue in 2010 and 2009, and another customer accounting for 17% of our net revenue in 2010 and 2009. These two largest customers accounted for 44% of our accounts receivable as of December 25, 2010 (41% as of December 26, 2009). For 2009 compared to 2008, the $244 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities, partially offset by lower net income. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2009 compared to 2008 were $3.1 billion lower, primarily due to lower income before taxes and timing of payments. Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, maturities, disposals, and cash used for acquisitions. The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of available-for-sale investments and, to a lesser extent, higher capital expenditures ($5.2 billion in 2010 and $4.5 billion in 2009). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net purchases of trading assets and lower cash paid for acquisitions. The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets, and higher cash paid for acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in investments in non-marketable equity investments. Our investments in non-marketable equity investments in 2008 included $1.0 billion for an ownership interest in Clearwire LLC. Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans. The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2009. During 2010, we repurchased $1.7 billion of common stock compared to $1.8 billion in 2009. As of December 25, 2010, $4.2 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of $25 billion. In January 2011, our Board of Directors increased the repurchase authorization limit by $10 billion. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled $587 million in 2010 compared to $400 million in 2009. Our total dividend payments were $3.5 billion in 2010 compared to $3.1 billion in 2009 as a result of an increase in quarterly cash dividends per common share. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 73 quarters. In January 2011, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.1812 per common share for the first quarter of 2011. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2011 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2011. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases of common stock and the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by lower proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans. We used the majority of the proceeds from the 2009 issuance of long-term debt to repurchase common stock. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Liquidity Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. As of December 25, 2010, cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt instruments included in trading assets, and short-term investments totaled $21.5 billion. In addition to the $21.5 billion, we have $3.9 billion in loans receivable and other long-term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio. In the first quarter of 2011, we completed the acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon. Total net cash consideration for the acquisition is estimated at $1.4 billion. For further information, see Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with A/A2 or better rated issuers, and a substantial majority of the issuers are rated AA-/Aa3 or better. Our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2010 were $150 million, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 25, 2010. Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard  Poors and P-1 by Moodys as of December 25, 2010. We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions or strategic investments. Fair Value of Financial Instruments When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. For further information, see Fair Value in Note 2: Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value on a recurring basis. When fair value is determined using pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, the issuers credit risk and/or Intels credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value, as appropriate. Marketable Debt Instruments As of December 25, 2010, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $24 billion of marketable debt instruments. Of these instruments, $7 billion was classified as Level 1, $16.7 billion as Level 2, and $308 million as Level 3. Our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. Management judgment was required to determine the levels for the frequency of transactions that should be met for a market to be considered active. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration the number of days each individual instrument trades over a specified period. Of the $16.7 billion balance of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2, approximately 45% of the balance was classified as Level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model and approximately 55% due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data. Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. When observable market data is not available, we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data, if available. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Equity Securities As of December 25, 2010, our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $1.4 billion of marketable equity securities. Of these securities, $1.2 billion was classified as Level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period. The remaining marketable equity securities of $223 million were classified as Level 2 because their valuations were either adjusted for security-specific restrictions or based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 25, 2010: ##TABLE_START                      Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than (In Millions) Total 1 Year 13 Years 35 Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 327 $ 102 $ 142 $ 52 $ 31 Capital purchase obligations 1 4,576 4,260 316   Other purchase obligations and commitments 2 567 393 106 65 3 Long-term debt obligations 3 6,969 119 238 238 6,374 Other long-term liabilities 4, 5 701 252 184 133 132 Total 6 $ 13,140 $ 5,126 $ 986 $ 488 $ 6,540 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2010, as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property.  2 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase raw materials or other goods, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include, for example, agreements to fund various projects with other companies.  3 Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments.  4 We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $190 million of long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the preceding table. However, long-term income taxes payable, included on our consolidated balance sheet, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non-U.S. income.  5 Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Expected contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $56 million to be made during 2011 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2011 are not practical to estimate.  6 Total generally excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities. ##TABLE_END Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms and/or the minimum cancellation fee. We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements are not included in the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the preceding table. These obligations include contingent funding/payment obligations and milestone-based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party. Assuming that all future milestones are met, additional required payments related to these obligations were not significant as of December 25, 2010. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relative taxing authority is not included in the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest. We have a contractual obligation to purchase the output of IMFT in proportion to our investment, which was 49% as of December 25, 2010. We also have several agreements with Micron related to intellectual property rights, and RD funding related to NAND flash manufacturing. The obligation to purchase our proportion of IMFTs inventory was approximately $100 million as of December 25, 2010. See Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In January 2011, we entered into a patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA. We agreed to make payments totaling $1.5 billion to NVIDIA over six years ($300 million in each of January 2011, 2012, and 2013; and $200 million in each of January 2014, 2015, and 2016). For further information, see Note 29: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. During 2010, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding common shares of McAfee for $48.00 per share in cash to be paid to the stockholders of McAfee. As of the date that we entered into the agreement, the transaction had an approximate value of $7.68 billion. We expect to complete the acquisition in the first quarter of 2011. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. For further information, see Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. During 2010, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the WLS business of Infineon. In the first quarter of 2011, we completed the acquisition. Total net cash consideration for the acquisition is estimated at $1.4 billion. For further information, see Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements As of December 25, 2010, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market and commodity price risk. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange Rates In general, we economically hedge currency risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with offsetting currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in a negligible net exposure to loss. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, the euro, and the Israeli shekel. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts and, to a lesser extent, currency options in these hedging programs. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements (see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $35 million as of December 25, 2010 (less than $40 million as of December 26, 2009). Interest Rates We generally hedge interest rate risks of fixed-rate debt instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in a negligible net exposure to interest rate loss. We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and debt issuances. We refer to our combined investment portfolio, investment hedges, and debt issuances as our net investment position. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields. To achieve this objective, the returns on our investments in debt instruments are generally based on the U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our debt issuances of approximately $235 million as of December 25, 2010 (an increase of approximately $205 million as of December 26, 2009). A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 1.0%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of up to approximately $15 million as of December 25, 2010 (an increase of approximately $10 million as of December 26, 2009). These hypothetical decreases in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately $220 million as of December 25, 2010 (a decrease of $195 million as of December 26, 2009). The fluctuations in fair value of our net investment position reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in our net investment position. For further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, see Fair Value of Financial Instruments in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Equity Prices Our marketable equity investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options. To the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities; however, for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments, we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks. For securities that we no longer consider strategic, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal, and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk. We hold derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. The gains and losses from changes in fair value of these derivatives are designed to offset the gains and losses on the related liabilities, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss. As of December 25, 2010, the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $1.5 billion ($805 million as of December 26, 2009). Our marketable equity investments include our investments in Micron, Imagination Technologies Group PLC, VMware, Inc., and Clearwire Corporation, and were carried at a total fair market value of $968 million, or 65% of our marketable equity portfolio, as of December 25, 2010. Our marketable equity method investment in SMART is excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed necessary. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we analyzed the expected market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a loss of 40% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $365 million, based on the value as of December 25, 2010 (a decrease in value of approximately $405 million, based on the value as of December 26, 2009 using an assumed loss of 50%). Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity investments, excluding investments accounted for under the equity method, had a carrying amount of $872 million as of December 25, 2010 ($939 million as of December 26, 2009). As of December 25, 2010, the carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $1.8 billion ($2.5 billion as of December 26, 2009). A substantial majority of this balance as of December 25, 2010 was concentrated in our IMFT/IMFS investment of $1.5 billion ($1.6 billion as of December 26, 2009). Our investments as of December 26, 2009 also included an investment of $453 million in Numonyx, which was sold in 2010.

INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1: Basis of Presentation We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008 were all 52-week years. Fiscal year 2011 is a 53-week year. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Intel Corporation and our wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. We use the equity method to account for equity investments in instances in which we own common stock or similar interests and have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. For all fiscal years presented, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for Intel and our subsidiaries; therefore, we do not have a translation adjustment recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Note 2: Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The accounting estimates that require our most significant, difficult, and subjective judgments include: ##TABLE_START   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments;   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets;   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions);   the valuation of inventory; and   the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies. ##TABLE_END The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. Fair Value Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value, except for equity method investments, cost method investments, cost method loans receivable, and most of our liabilities. Fair Value Hierarchy The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data. For further discussion of fair value, see Note 5: Fair Value and Note 22: Retirement Benefit Plans. Trading Assets Marketable debt instruments are designated as trading assets when the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. The gains or losses of these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments, are recorded in interest and other, net. We also designate certain floating-rate securitized financial instruments, primarily asset-backed securities, as trading assets. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In the second quarter of 2010, we sold our ownership interest in Numonyx B.V. to Micron Technology, Inc. for consideration consisting of shares of Micron. The Micron shares that we received in the transaction are classified as marketable equity securities within trading assets. Our interest in Micron makes up most of the balance of marketable equity securities included in trading assets. We have entered into equity options that economically hedge our remaining ownership interest in Micron. Gains and losses from the changes in the fair value of Micron shares are mostly offset by changes in the fair value of the related equity options and are recorded as gains (losses) on other equity investments, net. For further information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments. Available-for-Sale Investments We consider all liquid available-for-sale debt instruments with original maturities from the date of purchase of approximately three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Available-for-sale debt instruments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Available-for-sale debt instruments with remaining maturities beyond one year are classified as other long-term investments. Investments that we designate as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except as noted in the Other-Than-Temporary Impairment section below. We determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level. Our available-for-sale investments include: ##TABLE_START   Marketable debt instruments when the interest rate and foreign currency risks are not hedged at inception of the investment or when our designation for trading assets is not met. We generally hold these debt instruments to generate a return commensurate with the U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR. We record the interest income and realized gains and losses on the sale of these instruments in interest and other, net.   Marketable equity securities when the investments are considered strategic in nature at the time of original classification or there are barriers to mitigating equity market risk through the sale or use of derivative instruments at the time of original classification. We acquire these equity investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. To the extent that these investments continue to have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks through hedging activities. We record the realized gains or losses on the sale or exchange of marketable equity securities in gains (losses) on other equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END Non-Marketable and Other Equity Investments Our non-marketable equity and other equity investments are included in other long-term assets. We account for non-marketable equity and other equity investments for which we do not have control over the investee as: ##TABLE_START   Equity method investments when we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Gains (losses) on equity method investments, net may be recorded with up to a one-quarter lag. Equity method investments include marketable and non-marketable investments.   Non-marketable cost method investments when the equity method does not apply. We record the realized gains or losses on the sale of non-marketable cost method investments in gains (losses) on other equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END Other-Than-Temporary Impairment All of our available-for-sale investments and non-marketable and other equity investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. Investments are considered impaired when the fair value is below the investments cost basis/amortized cost. Impairments affect earnings as follows: ##TABLE_START   Marketable debt instruments when the fair value is below amortized cost and we intend to sell the instrument, it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument (that is, a credit loss exists). Other-than-temporary impairments are separated into amounts representing credit losses, which are recognized in interest and other, net, and amounts related to all other factors, which are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).   Marketable equity securities based on the specific facts and circumstances present at the time of assessment, which include the consideration of general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is below cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in value in the foreseeable future. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee, which may include industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and changes in the investees credit rating. We record other-than-temporary impairment charges on marketable equity securities in gains (losses) on other equity investments, net and for marketable equity method investments in gains (losses) on other equity method investments, net. ##TABLE_END 53 INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) ##TABLE_START   Non-marketable equity investments based on our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment, and qualitative and quantitative analysis, including: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the investees revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects;   the technological feasibility of the investees products and technologies;   the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes;   factors related to the investees ability to remain in business, such as the investees liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and   the investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. ##TABLE_END We record other-than-temporary impairment charges in gains (losses) on other equity investments, net for non-marketable cost method investments and in gains (losses) on equity method investments, net for equity method investments. Derivative Financial Instruments Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market and commodity price risk. Our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. Our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for designation as cash flow or fair value hedges. A designated hedge of the exposure to variability in the future cash flows of an asset or a liability, or of a forecasted transaction, is referred to as a cash flow hedge. A designated hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or a liability, or of an unrecognized firm commitment, is referred to as a fair value hedge. The criteria for designating a derivative as a hedge include the assessment of the instruments effectiveness in risk reduction, matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction, and the assessment of the probability that the underlying transaction will occur. For derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and within the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction. For derivatives with fair value hedge accounting designation, we recognize gains or losses from the change in fair value of these derivatives, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the underlying hedged item, in earnings. Derivatives that we designate as hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from operating activities. We recognize gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes within the line item on the consolidated statements of income most closely associated with the economic underlying, primarily in interest and other, net and gains (losses) on other equity investments, net. As part of our strategic investment program, we also acquire equity derivative instruments, such as equity conversion rights associated with debt instruments, that we do not designate as hedging instruments. We recognize the gains or losses from changes in fair values of these equity derivative instruments in gains (losses) on other equity investments, net. Gains and losses from derivatives not designated as hedges are classified in cash flows from operating activities. Measurement of Effectiveness ##TABLE_START   Effectiveness for forwards is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the present value of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item. For currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to capital purchases, forward points are excluded, and effectiveness is measured using spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item. For currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to operating expenditures, forward points are included and effectiveness is measured using forward rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item.   Effectiveness for options with hedge accounting designation is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of an option instrument representing the hedged risks in the hedged item for cash flow hedges. For cash flow and fair value hedges, time value is excluded and effectiveness is measured based on spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item.   Effectiveness for interest rate swaps and commodity swaps is generally measured by comparing the change in fair value of the hedged item with the change in fair value of the swap. ##TABLE_END 54 INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) If a cash flow hedge is discontinued because it is no longer probable that the original hedged transaction will occur as anticipated, the unrealized gain or loss on the related derivative is reclassified into earnings. Subsequent gains or losses on the related derivative instrument are recognized in interest and other, net in each period until the instrument matures, is terminated, is re-designated as a qualified hedge, or is sold. Ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and fair value hedges, as well as amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, are recognized in earnings in interest and other, net. For further discussion of our derivative instruments, see Note 8: Derivative Financial Instruments. Securities Lending We may enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions, generally to facilitate hedging and certain investment transactions. Selected securities may be loaned, secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investment assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and cash equivalent collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. For lending agreements collateralized by securities, we do not record the collateral as an asset or a liability, unless the collateral is repledged. Loans Receivable We make loans to third parties that are classified within other current assets or other long-term assets. We may elect the fair value option for loans when the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. We record the gains or losses on these loans arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate, currency market fluctuations, and credit market volatility, offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments, in interest and other, net. Loans that are denominated in U.S. dollars and have a floating-rate coupon are carried at amortized cost. We measure interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method, which is based on the effective yield of the loans rather than the stated coupon rate. Inventories We compute inventory cost on a currently adjusted standard basis (which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis). Inventories at year-ends were as follows: ##TABLE_START          (In Millions) 2010 2009 Raw materials $ 471 $ 437 Work in process 1,887 1,469 Finished goods 1,399 1,029 Total inventories $ 3,757 $ 2,935 ##TABLE_END Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, net at year-ends was as follows: ##TABLE_START          (In Millions) 2010 2009 Land and buildings $ 17,421 $ 16,687 Machinery and equipment 30,421 28,339 Construction in progress 2,639 2,796 Total property, plant and equipment, gross 50,481 47,822 Less: accumulated depreciation (32,582 ) (30,597 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 17,899 $ 17,225 ##TABLE_END We compute depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment, 2 to 4 years; buildings, 4 to 40 years. We capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Goodwill We record goodwill when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets as of the date of acquisition, assigning the goodwill to our applicable reporting units based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition. We perform a quarterly review of goodwill for indicators of impairment. During the fourth quarter of each year, we perform an impairment review for each reporting unit using a fair value approach. We do not identify manufacturing and assembly and test assets with individual reporting units because of the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets. In determining the carrying value of the reporting unit, we make an allocation of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets based on each reporting units relative percentage utilization of the manufacturing and assembly and test assets. For further discussion of goodwill, see Note 17: Goodwill. Identified Intangible Assets Intellectual property assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods of benefit, ranging from 3 to 17 years. We amortize acquisition-related developed technology based on economic benefit over the estimated useful life of 4 years. We amortize other intangible assets that are subject to amortization over periods ranging from 1 to 7 years. We amortize acquisition-related in-process research and development over the estimated useful life once the research and development efforts are completed. In the quarter following the period in which identified intangible assets become fully amortized, the fully amortized balances are removed from the gross asset and accumulated amortization amounts. We perform a quarterly review of identified intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. For further discussion of identified intangible assets, see Note 18: Identified Intangible Assets. Product Warranty The vast majority of our products are sold with a limited warranty on product quality and a limited indemnification for customers against intellectual property infringement claims related to our products. The accrual and the related expense for known product warranty issues were not significant during the periods presented. Due to product testing, the short time typically between product shipment and the detection and correction of product failures, and the historical rate of payments on indemnification claims, the accrual and related expense for estimated incurred but unidentified issues were not significant during the periods presented. Revenue Recognition We recognize net product revenue when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, transfer of title, and acceptance, if applicable, as well as fixed pricing and probable collectability. We record pricing allowances, including discounts based on contractual arrangements with customers, when we recognize revenue as a reduction to both accounts receivable and net revenue. Because of frequent sales price reductions and rapid technology obsolescence in the industry, we defer product revenue and related costs of sales from sales made to distributors under agreements allowing price protection or right of return until the distributors sell the merchandise. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. We record the net deferred income from product sales to distributors on our balance sheet as deferred income on shipments to distributors. We include shipping charges billed to customers in net revenue, and include the related shipping costs in cost of sales. Sales of software, primarily through our Wind River Software Group, are made through term licenses that are generally 12 months in length, or perpetual licenses. Revenue is generally deferred and recognized ratably over the course of the license. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Advertising Cooperative advertising programs reimburse customers for marketing activities for certain of our products, subject to defined criteria. We accrue cooperative advertising obligations and record the costs at the same time that the related revenue is recognized. We record cooperative advertising costs as marketing, general and administrative expenses to the extent that an advertising benefit separate from the revenue transaction can be identified and the fair value of that advertising benefit received is determinable. We record any excess in cash paid over the fair value of the advertising benefit received as a reduction in revenue. Advertising costs, including direct marketing costs, recorded within marketing, general and administrative expenses were $1.8 billion in 2010 ($1.4 billion in 2009 and $1.9 billion in 2008). Employee Equity Incentive Plans We have employee equity incentive plans, which are described more fully in Note 24: Employee Equity Incentive Plans. We use the straight-line attribution method to recognize share-based compensation over the service period of the award. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock units, we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and restricted stock units with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award. Note 3: Accounting Changes In the first quarter of 2010, we adopted new standards for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity. These new standards eliminated a mandatory quantitative approach in favor of a qualitative analysis, and require an ongoing reassessment. The adoption of these new standards did not impact our consolidated statements of income or balance sheets. In the first quarter of 2009, we adopted new standards that changed the accounting for convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features. As of adoption, these new standards applied to our junior subordinated convertible debentures issued in 2005 (the 2005 debentures). Under the previous standards, our 2005 debentures were recognized entirely as a liability at historical value. In accordance with adopting these new standards, in 2009 we retrospectively recognized both a liability and an equity component of the 2005 debentures at fair value. The liability component is recognized as the fair value of a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature at issuance. The equity component, which is the value of the conversion feature at issuance, is recognized as the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the 2005 debentures and the fair value of the liability component, after adjusting for the deferred tax impact. The 2005 debentures were issued at a coupon rate of 2.95%, which was below that of a similar instrument that did not have a conversion feature (6.45%). Therefore, the valuation of the debt component, using the income approach, resulted in a debt discount. The debt discount is reduced over the expected life of the debt, which is also the stated life of the debt. These new standards are also applicable in accounting for our convertible debt issued during 2009. See Note 21: Borrowings for further discussion. In the first quarter of 2009, we adopted revised standards for business combinations. These revised standards generally require an entity to recognize the assets, liabilities, contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. For circumstances in which the acquisition-date fair value for a contingency cannot be determined during the measurement period and it is concluded that it is probable that an asset or liability exists as of the acquisition date and the amount can be reasonably estimated, a contingency is recognized as of the acquisition date based on the estimated amount. The revised standards further require that acquisition-related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred, restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date, and changes in estimates for accounting of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties that occur subsequent to the measurement period be reflected in income tax expense (benefit). In addition, acquired in-process research and development is capitalized as an intangible asset. These new standards became applicable to business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of 2009. Our acquisitions completed during 2010 and 2009 have been accounted for using these revised standards. See Note 15: Acquisitions. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In the first quarter of 2009, we adopted new standards that specify the way in which fair value measurements should be made for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities that are not measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, and specify additional disclosures related to these fair value measurements. The adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the second quarter of 2009, we adopted new standards that provide guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities when the volume and level of activity for the asset/liability have significantly decreased. These new standards also provide guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. In addition, we are required to disclose in interim and annual periods the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and a discussion of changes in valuation techniques. The adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the second quarter of 2009, we adopted new standards for the recognition and measurement of other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities that replaced the pre-existing intent and ability indicator. These new standards specify that if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances in which an entity has an intent to sell the security, it is more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or the entity does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security (that is, a credit loss exists). Other-than-temporary impairments are separated into amounts representing credit losses, which are recognized in earnings, and amounts related to all other factors, which are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). The adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion, see Note 7: Available-for-Sale Investments. In the third quarter of 2009, we adopted amended standards for the fair value measurement of liabilities. These amended standards clarify that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, we are required to use the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset, quoted prices for similar liabilities, or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets. If these quoted prices are not available, we are required to use another valuation technique, such as an income approach or a market approach. These amended standards became effective for us beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009 and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the first quarter of 2008, we adopted new standards for fair value measurements for all financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The standards defined fair value, established a framework for measuring fair value, and enhanced fair value measurement disclosures. The adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, and the resulting fair values calculated after adoption were not significantly different from the fair values that would have been calculated under previous guidance. As discussed above, we adopted the fair value measurement standards for our non-financial assets and liabilities in the first quarter of 2009. For further discussion of our fair value measurements, see Note 5: Fair Value. In the first quarter of 2008, we adopted new standards that permitted companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value using an instrument-by-instrument election. The new standards required unrealized gains and losses to be reported in earnings for items measured using the fair value option. For further discussion, see Note 5: Fair Value. These new standards also required cash flows from purchases, sales, and maturities of trading securities to be classified based on the nature and purpose for which the securities were acquired. We assessed the nature and purpose of our trading assets and determined that our marketable debt instruments will be classified on the statement of cash flows as investing activities, as they are held with the purpose of generating returns. Activity related to equity securities offsetting deferred compensation remained classified as operating activities, as they were maintained to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risk of certain deferred compensation arrangements. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In the first quarter of 2008, amended views of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the use of the simplified method in developing estimates of the expected lives of share options became effective for us. The amendment, in part, allowed the continued use, subject to specific criteria, of the simplified method in estimating the expected lives of share options granted after December 31, 2007. We will continue to use the simplified method until we have the historical data necessary to provide reasonable estimates of expected lives. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we adopted new standards that clarified the application of fair value in a market that is not active, and addressed application issues such as the use of internal assumptions when relevant observable data does not exist, the use of observable market information when the market is not active, and the use of market quotes when assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data. The adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities. Note 4: Recent Accounting Standards In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amended standards that require additional fair value disclosures. These amended standards require disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value, as well as disclosures about significant transfers, beginning in the first quarter of 2010. Additionally, these amended standards require presentation of disaggregated activity within the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), beginning in the first quarter of 2011. In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are required to be adopted in the first quarter of 2011. We do not expect these new standards to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards for the accounting for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements. These new standards amend the scope of pre-existing software revenue guidance by removing from the guidance non-software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products. These new standards are required to be adopted in the first quarter of 2011. We do not expect these new standards to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 5: Fair Value Assets/Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components, consisted of the following types of instruments as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009: ##TABLE_START                                  December 25, 2010 December 26, 2009 Fair Value Measured and Fair Value Measured and Recorded at Reporting Date Using Recorded at Reporting Date Using (In Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets Cash equivalents: Commercial paper $  $ 2,600 $  $ 2,600 $  $ 2,919 $  $ 2,919 Government bonds 1,279 505  1,784     Bank deposits  560  560  459  459 Money market fund deposits 34   34 48   48 Short-term investments: Government bonds 4,890 1,320  6,210  250  250 Commercial paper  2,712  2,712  2,525  2,525 Corporate bonds 121 1,378 1 1,500 133 1,560 76 1,769 Bank deposits  858  858  697  697 Asset-backed securities   14 14   27 27 Money market fund deposits      17  17 Trading assets: Government bonds 311 2,115  2,426  1,351  1,351 Corporate bonds 199 916  1,115 80 1,005 45 1,130 Commercial paper  488  488  882  882 Marketable equity securities 388   388     Municipal bonds  375  375  390  390 Asset-backed securities   190 190   618 618 Bank deposits  108  108  264  264 Money market fund deposits 3   3 13   13 Other current assets: Derivative assets  330  330  136  136 Marketable equity securities 785 223  1,008 676 97  773 Other long-term investments: Government bonds 83 2,002  2,085 17 1,948  1,965 Corporate bonds 104 601 50 755 366 1,329 248 1,943 Bank deposits  133  133  162  162 Asset-backed securities   53 53   109 109 Other long-term assets: Loans receivable  642  642  249  249 Derivative assets  19 31 50  1 31 32 Total assets measured and recorded at fair value $ 8,197 $ 17,885 $ 339 $ 26,421 $ 1,333 $ 16,241 $ 1,154 $ 18,728 Liabilities Other accrued liabilities: Derivative liabilities $  $ 201 $ 7 $ 208 $  $ 112 $ 65 $ 177 Long-term debt   128 128   123 123 Other long-term liabilities: Derivative liabilities  47  47  49  49 Total liabilities measured and recorded at fair value $  $ 248 $ 135 $ 383 $  $ 161 $ 188 $ 349 ##TABLE_END Government bonds include bonds issued or deemed to be guaranteed by U.S. Treasury securities, non-U.S. governments, U.S. agency securities, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured corporate bonds. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Marketable Debt Instruments Marketable debt instruments include instruments such as commercial paper, corporate bonds, government bonds, bank deposits, asset-backed securities, municipal bonds, and money market fund deposits. When we use observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets, we classify our marketable debt instruments as Level 2. When observable market prices for identical securities are not available, we price our marketable debt instruments using non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data; quoted market prices for similar instruments; or pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers. These valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding and binding broker quotes; observable market prices for identical or similar securities; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and, to a lesser degree, unobservable market inputs. We corroborate non-binding market consensus prices with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exists. The discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs, such as LIBOR-based yield curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings. Our marketable debt instruments that are classified as Level 3 are classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. When observable market data is not available, we corroborate non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes using available unobservable data. The following tables present reconciliations for all assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for 2010 and 2009: ##TABLE_START                          Fair Value Measured and Recorded Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Asset- Corporate Backed Derivative Derivative Long-Term Total Gains (In Millions) Bonds Securities Assets Liabilities Debt (Losses) Balance as of December 26, 2009 $ 369 $ 754 $ 31 $ (65 ) $ (123 ) Total gains or losses (realized and unrealized): Included in earnings (2 ) 6 (3 ) (2 ) (5 ) (6 ) Included in other comprehensive income (loss) 4 9    13 Purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements, net (113 ) (512 ) 3   Transfers out of Level 3 (207 )   60  Balance as of December 25, 2010 $ 51 $ 257 $ 31 $ (7 ) $ (128 ) Changes in unrealized gains or losses included in earnings related to assets and liabilities still held as of December 25, 2010 $  $ 6 $ (4 ) $ (1 ) $ (5 ) $ (4 ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START                              Fair Value Measured and Recorded Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Asset- Government Corporate Backed Derivative Derivative Long-Term Total Gains (In Millions) Bonds Bonds Securities Assets Liabilities Debt (Losses) Balance as of December 27, 2008 $  $ 555 $ 1,083 $ 15 $ (25 ) $ (122 ) Total gains or losses (realized and unrealized): Included in earnings  4 25 (2 ) 18 (1 ) 44 Included in other comprehensive income (loss) 1 36 20    57 Purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements, net 300 279 (374 ) 18   Transfers into Level 3  100   (68 )  Transfers out of Level 3 (301 ) (605 )   10  Balance as of December 26, 2009 $  $ 369 $ 754 $ 31 $ (65 ) $ (123 ) Changes in unrealized gains or losses included in earnings related to assets and liabilities still held as of December 26, 2009 $  $  $ 53 $  $ 18 $ (1 ) $ 70 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For all periods presented, gains and losses (realized and unrealized) included in earnings were primarily reported in interest and other, net. During 2010 and 2009, we transferred corporate bonds from Level 3 to Level 2 due to a greater availability of observable market data and/or non-binding market consensus prices to value or corroborate the value of these instruments. Our policy is to reflect transfers in and transfers out at the beginning of the quarter in which a change in circumstances resulted in the transfer. Fair Value Option for Financial Assets/Liabilities We elected the fair value option for loans made to third parties in 2010 and 2009 when the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk was hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. As of December 25, 2010, the fair value of our loans receivable for which we elected the fair value option did not significantly differ from the contractual principal balance based on the contractual currency. These loans receivable are classified within other long-term assets. Fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Gains and losses from changes in fair value on the loans receivable and related derivative instruments, as well as interest income, are recorded in interest and other, net. During 2010 and 2009, changes in the fair value of our loans receivable were largely offset by changes in the related derivative instruments, resulting in an insignificant net impact on our consolidated statements of income. Gains and losses attributable to changes in credit risk are determined using observable credit default spreads for the issuer or comparable companies and were insignificant during 2010 and 2009. We did not elect the fair value option for loans when the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk was not hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. Under accounting standards effective in 2008, all of our non-convertible long-term debt was eligible at inception to be accounted for at fair value. However, we elected this fair value option only for the bonds issued in 2007 by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona (2007 Arizona bonds). In connection with the 2007 Arizona bonds, we entered into a total return swap agreement that effectively converts the fixed-rate obligation on the bonds to a floating U.S.-dollar LIBOR-based rate. As a result, changes in the fair value of this debt are largely offset by changes in the fair value of the total return swap agreement, without the need to apply hedge accounting provisions. The 2007 Arizona bonds are included in long-term debt. We did not elect this fair value option for our Arizona bonds issued in 2005 (2005 Arizona bonds). We used fixed-rate debt securities to offset the risk of changes in fair value of the 2005 Arizona bonds. Changes in the fair value of the purchased debt securities were reported in other comprehensive income. Electing the fair value option for our 2005 Arizona bonds would have resulted in changes in fair value having been recorded in our results of operations without the offset from changes in fair value of the debt securities. As of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, no other instruments were similar to the 2007 Arizona bonds for which we elected fair value treatment. As of December 25, 2010, the fair value of the 2007 Arizona bonds did not significantly differ from the contractual principal balance. The fair value of the 2007 Arizona bonds was determined using inputs that are observable in the market or that can be derived from or corroborated with observable market data, as well as unobservable inputs that were significant to the fair value. Gains and losses on the 2007 Arizona bonds and the related total return swap are recorded in interest and other, net. We capitalize interest associated with the 2007 Arizona bonds. We add capitalized interest to the cost of qualified assets and amortize it over the estimated useful lives of the assets. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis Our non-marketable equity investments and non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. The following table presents the financial instruments and non-financial assets that were measured and recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis during 2010, and the gains (losses) recorded during 2010 on those assets: ##TABLE_START                      Total Gains Net Carrying (Losses) for 12 Value as of Fair Value Measured and Recorded Using Months Ended (In Millions) Dec. 25, 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Dec. 25, 2010 Non-marketable equity investments $ 123 $  $  $ 128 $ (121 ) Property, plant and equipment $ 4 $  $ 4 $  $ (25 ) Total gains (losses) for assets held as of December 25, 2010 $ (146 ) Gains (losses) for non-marketable equity investments no longer held $ (4 ) Gains (losses) for property, plant and equipment no longer held $ (66 ) Total gains (losses) for recorded non-recurring measurement $ (216 ) ##TABLE_END The following table presents the financial instruments and non-financial assets that were measured and recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis during 2009, and the gains (losses) recorded during 2009 on those assets: ##TABLE_START                      Total Gains Net Carrying (Losses) for 12 Value as of Fair Value Measured and Recorded Using Months Ended (In Millions) Dec. 26, 2009 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Dec. 26, 2009 Non-marketable equity investments $ 208 $  $  $ 211 $ (187 ) Property, plant and equipment $ 27 $  $ 27 $  $ (16 ) Total gains (losses) for assets held as of December 26, 2009 $ (203 ) Gains (losses) for non-marketable equity investments no longer held $ (34 ) Gains (losses) for property, plant and equipment no longer held $ (136 ) Total gains (losses) for recorded non-recurring measurement $ (373 ) ##TABLE_END The following table presents the financial instruments that were measured and recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis during 2008, and the gains (losses) recorded during 2008 on those assets: ##TABLE_START                      Total Gains Net Carrying (Losses) for 12 Value as of Fair Value Measured and Recorded Using Months Ended (In Millions) Dec. 27, 2008 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Dec. 27, 2008 Clearwire Communications, LLC $ 238 $  $ 238 $  $ (762 ) Numonyx B.V. $ 484 $  $  $ 503 $ (250 ) Other non-marketable equity investments $ 84 $  $  $ 84 $ (200 ) Total gains (losses) for assets held as of December 27, 2008 $ (1,212 ) ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In the preceding tables, the carrying value of our impaired non-marketable equity investments may not equal our fair value measurement at the time of impairment due to the subsequent recognition of equity method adjustments, and the carrying value of our impaired property, plant and equipment may not equal our fair value measurement at the time of impairment due to the subsequent recognition of depreciation expense. A portion of our non-marketable equity investments were measured and recorded at fair value due to events or circumstances that significantly impacted the fair value of those investments, resulting in other-than-temporary impairment charges. We classified these measurements as Level 3, as we used unobservable inputs to the valuation methodologies that were significant to the fair value measurements, and the valuations required management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies sizes, growth rates, industries, development stages, and other relevant factors. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which requires the following significant estimates for the investee: revenue, based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share; costs; and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of market segment size, market segment share, and costs are developed by the investee and/or Intel using historical data and available market data. The valuation of these non-marketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, the investees capital structure, and the terms of the investees issued interests. During 2008, we recorded a $762 million impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC) to write down our investment to its fair value, primarily due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment. The impairment charge was included in gains (losses) on equity method investments, net. We determine the fair value of our investment in Clearwire LLC primarily using the quoted prices for its parent company, Clearwire Corporation. The effects of adjusting the quoted price for premiums that we believe market participants would consider for Clearwire LLC, such as tax benefits and voting rights associated with our investments, were mostly offset by the effects of discounts to the fair value, such as those due to transfer restrictions, lack of liquidity, and differences in dividend rights that are included in the value of Clearwire Corporation stock. We classified our investment in Clearwire LLC as Level 2, as the unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology were not significant to the measurement of fair value. For further information about Clearwire LLC and Clearwire Corporation, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments. We recorded a $250 million impairment charge on our investment in Numonyx during 2008 to write down our investment to its fair value. Estimates for revenue, earnings, and future cash flows were revised lower due to a general decline in the NOR flash memory market segment in 2008. We measured the fair value of our investment in Numonyx using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach included the use of a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of Numonyx, which required the use of unobservable inputs, including assumptions of projected revenue, expenses, capital spending, and other costs, as well as a discount rate calculated based on the risk profile of the flash memory market segment comparable to our investment in Numonyx. The market approach included the use of financial metrics and ratios, such as multiples of revenue and earnings of comparable public companies. The impairment charge was included in gains (losses) on equity method investments, net. Additionally, certain of our property, plant and equipment was measured and recorded at fair value during 2010 and 2009 due to events or circumstances we identified that indicated that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping was not recoverable, resulting in impairment charges. Most of these asset impairments related to manufacturing assets. Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis We measure the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments, marketable equity method investment, debt carried at amortized cost, and cost method loans receivable quarterly for disclosure purposes; however, they are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. The carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 were as follows: ##TABLE_START                  2010 2009 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair (In Millions) Amount Value Amount Value Non-marketable equity investments $ 2,633 $ 5,144 $ 3,411 $ 5,723 Marketable equity method investments $ 31 $ 167 $  $  Loans receivable $ 208 $ 208 $ 100 $ 100 Long-term debt $ 1,949 $ 2,283 $ 2,083 $ 2,314 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Our non-marketable equity investments as of December 26, 2009 included our investment in Numonyx. We sold our ownership interest in Numonyx to Micron in the second quarter of 2010. As of December 26, 2009, the fair value was based on managements assessment using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. For further information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments. As of December 25, 2010, we had non-marketable equity investments in an unrealized loss position of $10 million that had a fair value of $95 million (unrealized loss position of $30 million on non-marketable equity investments with a fair value of $205 million as of December 26, 2009). Our marketable equity method investment is our ownership interest in SMART Technologies, Inc. The fair value of our ownership interest in SMART was $167 million based on the quoted closing stock price as of December 25, 2010. For further information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments. The carrying amount and fair value of loans receivable exclude $642 million of loans measured and recorded at fair value as of December 25, 2010 ($249 million as of December 26, 2009). The carrying amount and fair value of long-term debt exclude $128 million of long-term debt measured and recorded at fair value as of December 25, 2010 ($123 million as of December 26, 2009). The carrying amount and fair value of the current portion of long-term debt are included in long-term debt in the preceding table. The fair value of our loans receivable is determined using a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. The fair value of our long-term debt takes into consideration variables such as credit-rating changes and interest rate changes. The credit quality of our loans receivable remains high, with credit ratings of A/A2 or better as of December 25, 2010. Note 6: Trading Assets Trading assets outstanding as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 were as follows: ##TABLE_START          (In Millions) 2010 2009 Marketable debt instruments $ 4,705 $ 4,648 Marketable equity securities 388  Total trading assets $ 5,093 $ 4,648 ##TABLE_END Net losses on marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets still held at the reporting date were $50 million in 2010 (gains of $91 million in 2009 and losses of $132 million in 2008). Net gains on the related derivatives were $43 million in 2010 (gains of $18 million in 2009 and losses of $5 million in 2008). In 2010, we sold our ownership in Numonyx to Micron. The Micron shares that we received in the transaction are classified as marketable equity securities within trading assets. For further information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments. Net losses on marketable equity securities classified as trading assets still held at the reporting date, excluding the impacts of the related derivatives, were $14 million in 2010. During 2009, we sold our equity securities offsetting deferred compensation, which were classified as trading assets, and entered into derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to those deferred compensation arrangements. The deferred compensation liabilities were $646 million as of December 25, 2010 ($511 million as of December 26, 2009) and are included in other accrued liabilities. See Note 8: Derivative Financial Instruments for further information on our equity market risk management programs. Net losses on equity securities offsetting deferred compensation arrangements still held at the reporting date were $209 million in 2008. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 7: Available-for-Sale Investments Available-for-sale investments as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 were as follows: ##TABLE_START                                  2010 2009 Gross Gross Gross Gross Adjusted Unrealized Unrealized Fair Adjusted Unrealized Unrealized Fair (In Millions) Cost Gains Losses Value Cost Gains Losses Value Government bonds $ 10,075 $ 9 $ (5 ) $ 10,079 $ 2,205 $ 11 $ (1 ) $ 2,215 Commercial paper 5,312   5,312 5,444   5,444 Corporate bonds 2,250 9 (4 ) 2,255 3,688 38 (14 ) 3,712 Bank deposits 1,550 1  1,551 1,317 1  1,318 Marketable equity securities 380 629 (1 ) 1,008 387 386  773 Asset-backed securities 76  (9 ) 67 154  (18 ) 136 Money market fund deposits 34   34 65   65 Total available-for-sale investments $ 19,677 $ 648 $ (19 ) $ 20,306 $ 13,260 $ 436 $ (33 ) $ 13,663 ##TABLE_END In the preceding table, government bonds include bonds issued or deemed to be guaranteed by U.S. Treasury securities, non-U.S. governments, U.S. agency securities, and FDIC-insured corporate bonds. Bank deposits were primarily issued by institutions outside the U.S. as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009. As of December 25, 2010, $12 million of the $19 million gross unrealized losses were related to individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or more ($26 million of the $33 million as of December 26, 2009). The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale debt investments as of December 25, 2010, by contractual maturity, were as follows: ##TABLE_START          (In Millions) Cost Fair Value Due in 1 year or less $ 16,225 $ 16,225 Due in 12 years 2,190 2,200 Due in 25 years 769 770 Due after 5 years 3 2 Instruments not due at a single maturity date 110 101 Total $ 19,297 $ 19,298 ##TABLE_END Instruments not due at a single maturity date in the preceding table include asset-backed securities and money market fund deposits. We sold available-for-sale investments for proceeds of $475 million in 2010 ($192 million in 2009 and $1.2 billion in 2008). The gross realized gains on sales of available-for-sale investments were $160 million in 2010 ($43 million in 2009 and $38 million in 2008) and were primarily related to our sales of marketable equity securities. Gains on third-party merger transactions during 2010 were insignificant ($56 million in 2009 and insignificant in 2008). Impairment charges recognized on available-for-sale investments were insignificant in 2010 and 2009 ($354 million in 2008). The 2008 impairment charges were primarily related to a $176 million impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire Corporation and $97 million of impairment charges on our investment in Micron. Gross realized losses recognized on available-for-sale investments were $13 million in 2010 ($64 million in 2009 and insignificant in 2008). We had previously recognized other-than-temporary impairments totaling $34 million during 2008 and 2009 on the investments that were sold in 2009. Note 8: Derivative Financial Instruments Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk and commodity price risk. We currently do not hold derivative instruments for the purpose of managing credit risk since we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty and generally enter into derivative transactions with high-credit-quality counterparties. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to currency exchange rate risk and generally hedge our exposures with currency forward contracts, currency options, or currency interest rate swaps. Substantially all of our revenue and a majority of our expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, certain operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, the euro, and the Israeli shekel. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. Our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable are generally hedged with offsetting currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. These programs reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. Our currency risk management programs include: ##TABLE_START   Currency derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize currency forward contracts and currency options to hedge exposures to the variability in the U.S.-dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S.-dollar-denominated cash flows. These instruments generally mature within 12 months. All of our currency forward contracts are settled at maturity involving one cash-payment exchange. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and within the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction.   Currency derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities and non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets. The maturity of these instruments generally occurs within 12 months, except for derivatives associated with certain long-term equity-related investments and our loans receivable that generally mature within five years. The currency interest rate swaps are settled at various interest payment times involving cash payments at each interest and principal payment date, with the majority of the contracts having quarterly payments. Changes in the U.S.-dollar-equivalent cash flows of the underlying assets and liabilities are approximately offset by the changes in fair values of the related derivatives. We record net gains or losses in the line item on the consolidated statements of income most closely associated with the economic underlying, primarily in interest and other, net, except for equity-related gains or losses, which we primarily record in gains (losses) on other equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END Interest Rate Risk Our primary objective for holding investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields. We generally swap the returns on our investments in fixed-rate debt instruments with remaining maturities longer than six months into U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns, unless management specifically approves otherwise. These swaps are settled at various interest payment times involving cash payments at each interest and principal payment date, with the majority of the contracts having quarterly payments. Our interest rate risk management programs include: ##TABLE_START   Interest rate derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest characteristics of debt instruments. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and within the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction.   Interest rate derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize interest rate swaps and currency interest rate swaps in economic hedging transactions, including hedges of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets. Floating interest rates on the swaps are reset on a monthly, quarterly, or semiannual basis. Changes in fair value of the debt instruments classified as trading assets are generally offset by changes in fair value of the related derivatives, both of which are recorded in interest and other, net. ##TABLE_END 67 INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Equity Market Risk Our marketable investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. To the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities. We may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments. For securities that we no longer consider strategic, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk. Our equity market risk management program includes equity derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives. We recognize changes in the fair value of such derivatives in gains (losses) on other equity investments, net. We also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains and losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the gains and losses on the related liabilities, both of which are recorded in interest and other, net. In 2010, we sold our ownership interest in Numonyx to Micron for consideration consisting of shares of Micron. We have entered into equity options that economically hedge our remaining ownership interest in Micron. For further information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments. Commodity Price Risk We operate facilities that consume commodities, and have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices, such as those for natural gas. These programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of commodity price movements. Our commodity price risk management program includes commodity derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize commodity swap contracts to hedge future cash flow exposures to the variability in commodity prices. These instruments generally mature within 12 months. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain (loss) from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and within the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction. Volume of Derivative Activity Total gross notional amounts for outstanding derivatives (recorded at fair value) as of December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009, and December 27, 2008 were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Currency forwards $ 8,502 $ 5,732 $ 4,331 Embedded debt derivatives 3,600 3,600 1,600 Currency interest rate swaps 2,259 1,577 612 Interest rate swaps 2,166 1,698 1,209 Total return swaps 627 530 125 Equity options 496 50 68 Currency options 94 375  Other 66 80 95 Total $ 17,810 $ 13,642 $ 8,040 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The gross notional amounts for currency forwards, currency interest rate swaps, and currency options (presented by currency) as of December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009, and December 27, 2008 were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Euro $ 4,445 $ 3,330 $ 1,819 Japanese yen 3,440 1,764 909 Israeli shekel 1,191 707 680 British pound sterling 424 563 366 Malaysian ringgit 382 310 326 Chinese yuan 347 434 491 Other 626 576 352 Total $ 10,855 $ 7,684 $ 4,943 ##TABLE_END Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features An insignificant amount of our derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features, such as provisions that require our debt to maintain an investment-grade credit rating from each of the major credit-rating agencies. As of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, we did not have any derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a significant net liability position. Fair Values of Derivative Instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets The fair values of our derivative instruments as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 were as follows: ##TABLE_START                                  2010 2009 Other Other Other Other Other Other Other Other Current Long-Term Accrued Long-Term Current Long-Term Accrued Long-Term (In Millions) Assets Assets Liabilities Liabilities Assets Assets Liabilities Liabilities Derivatives designated as hedging instruments Currency forwards $ 120 $ 3 $ 43 $ 3 $ 81 $ 1 $ 20 $ 1 Other 2    1  4  Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments $ 122 $ 3 $ 43 $ 3 $ 82 $ 1 $ 24 $ 1 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments Currency forwards $ 35 $  $ 14 $  $ 40 $  $ 11 $  Interest rate swaps 2  96    81  Currency interest rate swaps 64 17 47 13 5  47 9 Embedded debt derivatives    31    39 Total return swaps 41 6   4 3 4  Equity options 65 5 7   8 5  Other 1 19 1  5 20 5  Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments $ 208 $ 47 $ 165 $ 44 $ 54 $ 31 $ 153 $ 48 Total derivatives $ 330 $ 50 $ 208 $ 47 $ 136 $ 32 $ 177 $ 49 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships The before-tax effects of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships for the three years ended December 25, 2010 were as follows: ##TABLE_START                            Gains (Losses) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Gains (Losses) Reclassified from Accumulated OCI into (Effective Portion) Income by Derivative Instrument Type (Effective Portion) (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Location 2010 2009 2008 Currency forwards $ 66 $ 43 $ 26 Cost of sales $ 49 $ (12 ) $ 59 Research and development 27 (30 ) 39 Marketing, general and administrative 4 (12 ) 6 Other 4 (12 ) (6 ) Cost of sales (2 ) (13 ) (3 ) Total $ 70 $ 31 $ 20 $ 78 $ (67 ) $ 101 ##TABLE_END Gains and losses on derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships related to hedge ineffectiveness and amounts excluded from effectiveness testing were insignificant during all periods presented in the preceding tables. We estimate that we will reclassify approximately $110 million (before taxes) of net derivative gains included in other accumulated comprehensive income (loss) into earnings within the next 12 months. For all periods presented, there was an insignificant impact on results of operations from discontinued cash flow hedges as a result of forecasted transactions that did not occur. Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The effects of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of income for the three years ended December 25, 2010 were as follows: ##TABLE_START                Location of Gains (Losses) (In Millions) Recognized in Income on Derivatives 2010 2009 2008 Currency forwards Interest and other, net $ 72 $ 37 $ 82 Interest rate swaps Interest and other, net (59 ) 15 (27 ) Currency interest rate swaps Interest and other, net 74 (7 ) 47 Total return swaps Interest and other, net 70 51 2 Other Interest and other, net (1 ) 2 (11 ) Equity options Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net 59 5 (9 ) Other Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net (2 ) 12 2 Total $ 213 $ 115 $ 86 ##TABLE_END Note 9: Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, derivative financial instruments, loans receivable, and trade receivables. We enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. For presentation on our consolidated balance sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterpartys relative credit standing. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with A/A2 or better rated issuers, and a substantial majority of the issuers are rated AA-/Aa3 or better. Our investment policy requires substantially all investments with original maturities at the time of investment of up to six months to be rated at least A-2/P-2 by Standard  Poors/Moodys, and specifies a higher minimum rating for investments with longer maturities. For instance, investments with maturities of greater than three years require a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3 at the time of investment. Government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, or the absence of A rated counterparties in certain countries, result in some minor exceptions. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. The amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterpartys obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of December 25, 2010, the total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding U.S. Treasury securities, did not exceed $500 million. We obtain and secure available collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions, when we deem it appropriate. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers. We also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and retail distributors. Our two largest customers accounted for 38% of net revenue for 2010, 2009, and 2008. Additionally, these two largest customers accounted for 44% of our accounts receivable as of December 25, 2010 and 41% of our accounts receivable as of December 26, 2009. We believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe that credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis, and from this analysis, we establish credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices, such as obtaining some form of third-party guarantee or standby letter of credit, or obtaining credit insurance for all or a portion of the account balance if necessary. Note 10: Other Long-Term Assets Other long-term assets as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 were as follows: ##TABLE_START          (In Millions) 2010 2009 Equity method investments $ 1,791 $ 2,472 Non-marketable cost method investments 872 939 Identified intangible assets 860 883 Non-current deferred tax assets 289 278 Loans receivable 741 249 Other 558 519 Total other long-term assets $ 5,111 $ 5,340 ##TABLE_END Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments Equity Method Investments Equity method investments as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 were as follows: ##TABLE_START                  2010 2009 Carrying Ownership Carrying Ownership (In Millions, Except Percentages) Value Percentage Value Percentage IM Flash Technologies, LLC $ 1,126 49 % $ 1,323 49 % IM Flash Singapore, LLP 335 22 % 299 49 % Clearwire Communications, LLC 145 7 % 261 7 % SMART Technologies, Inc. 31 14 %  25 % Numonyx B.V.   % 453 45 % Other equity method investments 154 136 Total $ 1,791 $ 2,472 ##TABLE_END IMFT/IMFS Micron and Intel formed IM Flash Technologies, LLC (IMFT) in January 2006 and IM Flash Singapore, LLP (IMFS) in February 2007. We established these joint ventures to manufacture NAND flash memory products for Micron and Intel. As of December 25, 2010, we own a 49% interest in IMFT and a 22% interest in IMFS. Our investment in IMFT/IMFS was $1.5 billion as of December 25, 2010 ($1.6 billion as of December 26, 2009). The IMFS fabrication facility is in its start-up phase with initial production expected in the first half of 2011. Intel has made limited additional investments in 2010, resulting in the decline of our ownership interest in IMFS from 49% as of December 26, 2009. We will assess any additional investments in IMFS based on market conditions. IMFT and IMFS are each governed by a Board of Managers, with Micron and Intel initially appointing an equal number of managers to each of the boards. The number of managers appointed by each party adjusts depending on the parties ownership interests. As a result of the reduction of our ownership interest in IMFS, Micron now appoints the majority of the managers on the IMFS board. These ventures will operate until 2016 but are subject to earlier termination under certain terms and conditions. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) These joint ventures are variable interest entities. All costs of the joint ventures will be passed on to Micron and Intel through our purchase agreements. IMFT and IMFS are dependent upon Micron and Intel for any additional cash requirements. Our known maximum exposure to loss approximated our investment balance in IMFT/IMFS as of December 25, 2010. Our investment in these ventures is classified within other long-term assets. As of December 25, 2010, except for the amount due to IMFT/IMFS for product purchases and services, we did not incur any additional liabilities in connection with our interests in these joint ventures. In addition to the potential loss of our existing investment, our actual losses could be higher, as Intel and Micron are liable for other future operating costs or obligations of IMFT/IMFS. In addition, future cash calls could increase our investment balance and the related exposure to loss. Finally, as we are currently committed to purchasing 49% of IMFTs and 47% of IMFSs production output and production-related services, we may be required to purchase products at a cost in excess of realizable value. Our contractual commitment to purchase product output and fund production-related services adjusts to changes in our ownership percentage on a one-year lag. Our portion of IMFT costs, primarily related to product purchases and production-related services, was approximately $735 million during 2010 and 2009 (approximately $1.1 billion during 2008). The amount due to IMFT for product purchases and services provided was approximately $95 million as of December 25, 2010 (approximately $75 million as of December 26, 2009). During 2010, $197 million was returned to Intel by IMFT, which is reflected as a return of equity method investment within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows ($419 million during 2009 and $298 million during 2008). In 2010, IMFT increased its capital expenditures compared to 2009. The cash used for those capital expenditures reduced the amount of cash provided by IMFT to us as a return of equity method investment in 2010. Under the accounting standards for consolidating variable interest entities, the consolidating investor is the entity with the power to direct the activities of the venture that most significantly impact the ventures economic performance and with the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the venture that could potentially be significant to the venture. We have determined that we do not have both of these characteristics and, therefore, we account for our interests using the equity method of accounting. Clearwire Communications, LLC In 2008, we invested $1.0 billion in Clearwire LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Clearwire Corporation. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we invested an additional $50 million. Our investment in Clearwire LLC is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and our proportionate share of the income or loss is recognized on a one-quarter lag. During 2010, we recognized $116 million of equity method losses. During 2009, we recorded $27 million of equity method losses, which was net of a gain of $37 million as a result of a dilution of our ownership interest from the additional investment. Due to the one-quarter lag, we did not record equity method adjustments related to Clearwire LLC during 2008. During 2008, we recorded a $762 million impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire LLC to write down our investment to its fair value. The impairment charge was included in gains (losses) on equity method investments, net. For further discussion, see Note 5: Fair Value. As of December 25, 2010, our investment balance in Clearwire LLC was $145 million and is classified within other long-term assets ($261 million as of December 26, 2009). As of December 25, 2010, the carrying value of our investment in Clearwire LLC was $297 million below our share of the book value of the net assets of Clearwire Corporation, and a substantial majority of this difference has been attributed to Clearwire Corporations spectrum assets, a majority of which have an indefinite life. SMART Technologies, Inc. We hold an equity interest in SMART and account for our interest using the equity method of accounting. As of December 25, 2010, our carrying value in SMART was $31 million and was classified within other long-term assets. In 2010, SMART completed an initial public offering of shares approved for listing on The NASDAQ Global Select Market*. We sold approximately 10 million of our 27.5 million shares in the secondary offering. We recognized a gain of $181 million on the initial public offering and subsequent sale of our shares in the secondary offering, which is included in gains (losses) on equity method investments, net. Numonyx B.V. In 2008, we divested our NOR flash memory business in exchange for a 45.1% ownership interest in Numonyx. For further discussion, see Note 16: Divestitures. Our initial ownership interest, comprising common stock and a note receivable, was recorded at $821 million. Our investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and our proportionate share of the income or loss was recognized on a one-quarter lag. During 2010, we recognized $42 million of equity method gains ($31 million of equity method losses in 2009 and $87 million in 2008) within gains (losses) on equity method investments, net. In 2008, we also recorded a $250 million impairment charge on our investment in Numonyx within gains (losses) on equity method investments, net. For further discussion, see Note 5: Fair Value. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) As of December 26, 2009, our investment balance in Numonyx was $453 million and was classified within other long-term assets. During 2010, we sold our ownership interest in Numonyx to Micron and recognized a gain on the sale of $91 million, which is included in gains (losses) on equity method investments, net. In exchange for our investment in Numonyx, we received 57.9 million shares of Micron common stock, with an additional 8.6 million shares held in escrow for 12 months after the sale, and we issued a $72 million short-term note payable. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we sold 21.5 million shares of Micron common stock, which consisted of the 8.6 million shares held in escrow and an additional 12.9 million shares received in the sale of Numonyx. The proceeds from the sale of the escrow shares are classified as a receivable within other current assets. The remaining 45 million Micron shares are classified within trading assets. We have equity options that economically hedge these remaining shares. In 2008, Numonyx entered into an unsecured, four-year senior credit facility of up to $550 million, consisting of a $450 million term loan and a $100 million revolving loan. Intel and STMicroelectronics N.V. had each provided the lenders with a guarantee of 50% of the payment obligations of Numonyx under the senior credit facility. The Numonyx senior credit facility that was supported by our guarantee was repaid in connection with the closing of Microns acquisition of Numonyx. Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC Subsequent to the end of 2010, Intel and General Electric Company (GE) formed an equally owned joint venture in the healthcare industry that will focus on independent living and delivery of health-related services via telecommunications. The new company was formed by combining assets of GE Healthcares Home Health division and Intels Digital Health Group. As a result of the formation of the joint venture, we expect to recognize a gain of approximately $165 million in the first quarter of 2011 that will be recorded in interest and other, net. Cost Method Investments The carrying value of our non-marketable cost method investments was $872 million as of December 25, 2010 and $939 million as of December 26, 2009. In 2010, we recognized impairment charges on non-marketable cost method investments of $109 million within gains (losses) on other equity investments, net ($179 million in 2009 and $135 million in 2008). Note 12: Gains (Losses) on Equity Method Investments, Net Gains (losses) on equity method investments, net included: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Equity method losses, net $ (113 ) $ (131 ) $ (316 ) Impairment charges (16 ) (42 ) (1,077 ) Other, net 246 26 13 Total gains (losses) on equity method investments, net $ 117 $ (147 ) $ (1,380 ) ##TABLE_END During 2010, we recognized a gain of $33 million on the initial public offering of SMART, included within Equity method losses, net, and a gain of $148 million on the subsequent sale of our shares in a secondary offering, included in Other, net, resulting in a total gain of $181 million. In addition, during 2010 we recognized a gain of $91 million on the sale of our ownership interest in Numonyx, included in Other, net in the preceding table.

During 2010, we completed three business acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate net cash consideration of $218 million. Substantially all of the consideration was allocated to goodwill and intangibles. During the third quarter of 2009, we completed two acquisitions qualifying as business combinations for total consideration of $885 million (net of $59 million cash acquired). Substantially all of this amount related to the acquisition of Wind River Systems, Inc., a vendor of software for embedded devices, completed by acquiring all issued and outstanding Wind River Systems common shares. The objective of the acquisition of Wind River Systems was to enable the introduction of products for the embedded and handheld market segments, resulting in benefits for our existing operations. The combined consideration for acquisitions completed during 2009 was allocated as follows: ##TABLE_START      (In Millions) Fair value of net tangible assets acquired $ 47 Goodwill 489 Acquired developed technology 148 Other identified intangible assets 169 Share-based awards assumed 32 Total $ 885 ##TABLE_END For information on the assignment of goodwill for the acquisitions completed in 2010 and 2009, see Note 17: Goodwill. The completed acquisitions in 2010 and 2009 both individually and in the aggregate were not significant to our consolidated results of operations. First Quarter 2011 Acquisition of Wireless Solutions Business of Infineon Technologies AG On January 31, 2011, we completed the acquisition of the Wireless Solutions (WLS) business of Infineon. Total net cash consideration to acquire the WLS business is estimated at $1.4 billion. The acquired business will operate as Intel Mobile Communications and offer mobile phone components such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers, and power management chips. The objective of the acquisition is to provide solutions that enable a broad range of computing applications to have wireless connectivity. Due to the relatively short time from the date of acquisition to the completion of these financial statements, the initial accounting for the acquisition is not complete. The preliminary evaluation of the fair value for certain significant assets and liabilities, including goodwill and intangibles, is not complete. The goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Since the pro forma revenue and earnings are dependent on the purchase price allocation, we are unable to provide unaudited pro forma information for the year ended December 25, 2010. We will provide the preliminary purchase price allocation and pro forma information with our 10-Q for the first quarter of 2011. We are still evaluating the organization structure and reporting of Intel Mobile Communications, as well as its related impact on our reportable segment disclosures. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Pending Acquisition of McAfee, Inc. In the third quarter of 2010, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire McAfee, and expect to complete the acquisition in the first quarter of 2011. Upon completion of the acquisition and subject to certain exceptions, each outstanding share of McAfee common stock and each share of McAfee common stock subject to restricted stock awards, vested restricted stock unit awards, and vested performance stock unit awards will be converted into the right to receive $48.00 in cash. As of the date we entered into the agreement, the transaction had an approximate value of $7.68 billion. Subject to certain exceptions, McAfee options, unvested restricted stock units, and unvested performance units outstanding prior to the completion of the agreement will be converted into Intel stock options and restricted stock units, as applicable, based on formulas set forth in the agreement. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. Note 16: Divestitures During the second quarter of 2008, we completed the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business. We exchanged certain NOR flash memory assets and certain assets associated with our phase change memory initiatives with Numonyx for a note receivable with a contractual amount of $144 million and a 45.1% ownership interest in the form of common stock, together valued at $821 million. Approximately 2,500 employees of our NOR flash memory business became employees of Numonyx. We did not incur a gain or loss upon completion of the transaction in the second quarter of 2008, as we had recorded asset impairment charges in quarters prior to deal closure. For further discussion, see Note 19: Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. Subsequent to the divestiture, in the third quarter of 2008 we recorded a $250 million impairment charge on our investment in Numonyx within gains (losses) on equity method investments, net. During 2010, we sold our ownership interest in Numonyx to Micron. For further information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments. During the first quarter of 2008, we completed the divestiture of a portion of the telecommunications-related assets of our optical platform division. Consideration for the divestiture was $85 million, including $75 million in cash and common shares of the acquiring company, with an estimated value of $10 million at the date of purchase. We entered into an agreement with the acquiring company to provide certain manufacturing and transition services for a limited time that has since been completed. During the first quarter of 2008, as a result of this divestiture, we recorded a net gain of $39 million within interest and other, net. During the second quarter of 2008, we completed the sale of the remaining portion of our optical platform division for common shares of the acquiring company with an estimated value of $27 million at the date of purchase. Overall, approximately 100 employees of our optical products business became employees of the acquiring company. Note 17: Goodwill Goodwill activity for the years ended December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 was as follows: ##TABLE_START                              Other Intel Digital Architecture Other Enterprise Mobility PC Client Data Center Operating Operating (In Millions) Group Group Group Group Segments Segments Total December 27, 2008 $ 3,515 $ 248 $  $  $  $ 169 $ 3,932 Additions due to business combinations 192 142    155 489 Transfers (3,707 ) (390 ) 2,220 1,459 507 (89 )  December 26, 2009 $  $  $ 2,220 $ 1,459 $ 507 $ 235 $ 4,421 Additions due to business combinations   14  75 21 110 December 25, 2010 $  $  $ 2,234 $ 1,459 $ 582 $ 256 $ 4,531 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) At the end of 2009, we reorganized our business to better align our major product groups around the core competencies of Intel architecture and our manufacturing operations. Due to this reorganization, goodwill was allocated from our prior operating segments to our new operating segments, as shown in the preceding table under transfers. The allocation was based on the fair value of each business group within its original operating segment relative to the fair value of that operating segment. During 2009, prior to our reorganization, we completed two acquisitions, including the acquisition of Wind River Systems (see Note 15: Acquisitions for further discussion). Goodwill recognized from the Wind River Systems acquisition was assigned to our Digital Enterprise Group, our Mobility Group, our Digital Home Group, and our Wind River Software Group based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition. Our Wind River Software Group is included in the other operating segments category in the preceding table, while our Digital Home Group is included in the other Intel architecture operating segments category. The assignment of goodwill to our Digital Enterprise Group, our Mobility Group, and our Digital Home Group was based on the proportionate benefits expected to be generated for each group resulting from enhanced market presence for existing businesses. During 2010, we completed three acquisitions. The goodwill recognized from these acquisitions was assigned to our Digital Home Group, our Software and Services Group, our Ultra-Mobility Group, our PC Client Group, and our Embedded and Communications Group. Our Software and Services Group is included in the other operating segments category in the preceding table, while our Digital Home Group, our Ultra-Mobility Group, and our Embedded and Communications Group are all included in the other Intel architecture operating segments category. After completing our annual impairment reviews during the fourth quarter of 2010, 2009, and 2008, we concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years. As of December 25, 2010, accumulated impairment losses in total were $713 million: $355 million associated with our PC Client Group, $279 million associated with our Data Center Group, and $79 million associated with other Intel architecture operating segments. Note 18: Identified Intangible Assets We classify identified intangible assets within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Identified intangible assets consisted of the following as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009: ##TABLE_START              December 25, 2010 Accumulated (In Millions) Gross Assets Amortization Net Intellectual property assets $ 1,204 $ (765 ) $ 439 Acquisition-related developed technology 203 (90 ) 113 Other intangible assets 335 (27 ) 308 Total identified intangible assets $ 1,742 $ (882 ) $ 860 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START              December 26, 2009 Accumulated (In Millions) Gross Assets Amortization Net Intellectual property assets $ 1,190 $ (616 ) $ 574 Acquisition-related developed technology 166 (34 ) 132 Other intangible assets 509 (332 ) 177 Total identified intangible assets $ 1,865 $ (982 ) $ 883 ##TABLE_END As a result of our acquisitions in 2010, we recorded acquisition-related developed technology for $37 million with lives of four years, and additions to other intangible assets of $70 million with a weighted average life of six years. The substantial majority of other intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions in 2010 were associated with customer relationships. In addition, we acquired other intangible assets that are not subject to amortization for $96 million in 2010. During 2009, we acquired intellectual property assets for $99 million with a weighted average life of six years. During 2009, as a result of our acquisition of Wind River Systems, we recorded acquisition-related developed technology for $148 million with a weighted average life of four years, and additions to other intangible assets of $169 million with a weighted average life of seven years. The substantial majority of other intangible assets recorded were associated with customer relationships and the Wind River Systems trade name. The remaining amount of other intangible assets was related to acquired in-process research and development. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) We recorded the amortization of identified intangible assets on the consolidated statements of income as cost of sales, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, or a reduction of revenue. Amortization expenses for the three years ended December 25, 2010 were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Intellectual property assets $ 149 $ 149 $ 164 Acquisition-related developed technology $ 56 $ 30 $ 5 Other intangible assets $ 35 $ 129 $ 87 ##TABLE_END Based on identified intangible assets that are subject to amortization as of December 25, 2010, we expect amortization expenses for each period to be as follows: ##TABLE_START                      (In Millions) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Intellectual property assets $ 97 $ 86 $ 69 $ 59 $ 41 Acquisition-related developed technology $ 55 $ 33 $ 18 $ 7 $  Other intangible assets $ 40 $ 40 $ 39 $ 30 $ 26 ##TABLE_END Note 19: Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges The following table summarizes restructuring and asset impairment charges by plan for the three years ended December 25, 2010: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 2009 restructuring program $  $ 215 $  2008 NAND plan   215 2006 efficiency program  16 495 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $  $ 231 $ 710 ##TABLE_END 2009 Restructuring Program In the first quarter of 2009, management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing and assembly and test operations. These plans included closing two assembly and test facilities in Malaysia, one facility in the Philippines, and one facility in China; stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Oregon; and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in California. The 2009 restructuring program is complete. The following table summarizes charges for the 2009 restructuring program for the two years ended December 25, 2010: ##TABLE_START          (In Millions) 2010 2009 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $  $ 208 Asset impairments  7 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $  $ 215 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2009 restructuring program during 2009 and 2010: ##TABLE_START              Employee Severance and Asset (In Millions) Benefits Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2008 $  $  $  Additional accruals 223 7 230 Adjustments (15 )  (15 ) Cash payments (182 )  (182 ) Non-cash settlements  (7 ) (7 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2009 $ 26 $  $ 26 Additional accruals    Adjustments    Cash payments (26 )  (26 ) Non-cash settlements    Accrued restructuring balance as of December 25, 2010 $  $  $  ##TABLE_END Under the 2009 restructuring program, we incurred $208 million of charges related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 6,500 employees. 2008 NAND Plan In the fourth quarter of 2008, management approved a plan with Micron to discontinue the supply of NAND flash memory from the 200mm facility within the IMFT manufacturing network. The agreement resulted in a $215 million restructuring charge, primarily related to the IMFT 200mm supply agreement. The restructuring charge resulted in a reduction of our investment in IMFT/IMFS of $184 million, a cash payment to Micron of $24 million, and other cash payments of $7 million. The 2008 NAND plan was completed at the end of 2008. 2006 Efficiency Program In the third quarter of 2006, management approved several actions as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results. The following table summarizes charges for the 2006 efficiency program for the three years ended December 25, 2010: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $  $ 8 $ 151 Asset impairments  8 344 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $  $ 16 $ 495 ##TABLE_END During 2006, as part of our assessment of our worldwide manufacturing capacity operations, we placed for sale our fabrication facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. As a result of placing the facility for sale, in 2006 we recorded a $214 million impairment charge to write down to fair value the land, building, and equipment. We incurred $54 million in additional asset impairment charges as a result of market conditions related to the Colorado Springs facility during 2007 and additional charges in 2008. We sold the Colorado Springs facility in 2009. We incurred $85 million in asset impairment charges related to assets that we sold in conjunction with the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business in 2007, and an additional $275 million in 2008. We determined the impairment charges based on the fair value, less selling costs, that we expected to receive upon completion of the divestiture in 2007, and determined the impairment charges based on the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable that we received upon completion of the divestiture, less selling costs, in 2008. For further information on this divestiture, see Note 16: Divestitures. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2006 efficiency program during 2009: ##TABLE_START              Employee Severance and Asset (In Millions) Benefits Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2008 $ 57 $  $ 57 Additional accruals 18 8 26 Adjustments (10 )  (10 ) Cash payments (65 )  (65 ) Non-cash settlements  (8 ) (8 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2009 $  $  $  ##TABLE_END The 2006 efficiency program is complete. From the third quarter of 2006 through 2009, we incurred a total of $1.6 billion in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this program. These charges included a total of $686 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for 11,300 employees, and $896 million in asset impairment charges. Note 20: Chipset Design Issue In January 2011, as part of our ongoing quality assurance procedures, we identified a design issue with the Intel  6 Series Express Chipset family (formerly code-named Cougar Point). The issue affected chipsets sold in the fourth quarter of 2010 and January 2011. We subsequently implemented a silicon fix, and began shipping the updated version of the affected chipset in February 2011. We estimate that the total cost to repair and replace affected materials and systems, located with customers and in the market, will be approximately $660 million. We recorded a charge of $311 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, which comprised $67 million in product costs for the affected chipsets and $244 million to establish a product accrual for this issue. We expect to recognize an additional charge of approximately $350 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily related to an additional product accrual for the estimated costs to repair and replace affected materials and systems associated with products sold in January 2011. The charges incurred in the fourth quarter of 2010 are reflected in the results of the PC Client Group operating segment. Note 21: Borrowings Short-Term Debt Short-term debt included drafts payable of $38 million as of December 25, 2010 (current portion of long-term debt of $157 million and drafts payable of $15 million as of December 26, 2009). We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2010 were $150 million ($610 million during 2009). We did not have outstanding commercial paper as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009. Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard  Poors and P-1 by Moodys as of December 25, 2010. Long-Term Debt Our long-term debt as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 was as follows: ##TABLE_START          (In Millions) 2010 2009 2009 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2039 at 3.25% $ 1,041 $ 1,030 2005 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2035 at 2.95% 908 896 2005 Arizona bonds due 2035 at 4.375%  157 2007 Arizona bonds due 2037 at 5.3% 128 123 2,077 2,206 Less: current portion of long-term debt  (157 ) Total long-term debt $ 2,077 $ 2,049 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Convertible Debentures In 2009, we issued $2.0 billion of junior subordinated convertible debentures (the 2009 debentures) due in 2039. In 2005, we issued $1.6 billion of junior subordinated convertible debentures (the 2005 debentures) due in 2035. Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually. We capitalized all interest associated with these debentures during the periods presented. ##TABLE_START          2009 Debentures 2005 Debentures Coupon interest rate 3.25 % 2.95 % Effective interest rate 7.20 % 6.45 % Maximum amount of contingent interest that will accrue per year 0.50 % 0.40 % ##TABLE_END The effective interest rate is based on the rate for a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature. Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures have a contingent interest component that will require us to pay interest based on certain thresholds and for certain events commencing on August 1, 2019 and December 15, 2010, for the 2009 and 2005 debentures, respectively. The fair values of the related embedded derivatives were $12 million and $19 million as of December 25, 2010 for the 2009 and 2005 debentures, respectively ($15 million and $24 million as of December 26, 2009 for the 2009 and 2005 debentures, respectively). Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into shares of our common stock. Holders can surrender the 2009 debentures for conversion if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter. Holders can surrender the 2005 debentures for conversion at any time. We will settle any conversion or repurchase of the 2009 debentures in cash up to the face value, and any amount in excess of face value will be settled in cash or stock at our option. However, we can settle any conversion or repurchase of the 2005 debentures in cash or stock at our option. On or after August 5, 2019, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2009 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the date on which we provide notice of redemption. On or after December 15, 2012, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2005 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the date on which we provide notice of redemption. If certain events occur in the future, the indentures governing the 2009 and 2005 debentures provide that each holder of the debentures can, for a pre-defined period of time, require us to repurchase the holders debentures for the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures are subordinated in right of payment to any future senior debt and to the other liabilities of our subsidiaries. We have concluded that both the 2009 and 2005 debentures are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded stock conversion options qualify as derivatives. In addition, we have concluded that the embedded conversion options would be classified in stockholders equity if they were freestanding derivative instruments. As such, the embedded conversion options are not accounted for separately as derivatives. ##TABLE_START                  2009 Debentures 2005 Debentures Dec. 25, Dec. 26, Dec. 25, Dec. 26, (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 2010 2009 2010 2009 Outstanding principal $ 2,000 $ 2,000 $ 1,600 $ 1,600 Equity component carrying amount $ 613 $ 613 $ 466 $ 466 Unamortized discount $ 943 $ 953 $ 680 $ 691 Net debt carrying amount $ 1,041 $ 1,030 $ 908 $ 896 Conversion rate (shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures) 44.09 44.09 32.52 32.12 Effective conversion price (per share of common stock) $ 22.68 $ 22.68 $ 30.75 $ 31.14 ##TABLE_END In the preceding table, the remaining amortization periods for the unamortized discounts for the 2009 and 2005 debentures are approximately 29 and 25 years, respectively, as of December 25, 2010. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The conversion rate adjusts for certain events outlined in the indentures governing the 2009 and 2005 debentures, such as quarterly dividend distributions in excess of $0.14 and $0.10 per share, for the 2009 and 2005 debentures, respectively, but does not adjust for accrued interest. In addition, the conversion rate will increase for a holder of either the 2009 or 2005 debentures who elects to convert the debentures in connection with certain share exchanges, mergers, or consolidations involving Intel. Arizona Bonds In 2007, we guaranteed repayment of principal and interest on bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona, which constitute an unsecured general obligation for Intel. The aggregate principal amount of the bonds issued in December 2007 is $125 million due in 2037, and the bonds bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.3%. The 2007 Arizona bonds are subject to mandatory tender, at our option, on any interest payment date beginning on or after December 1, 2012 until their final maturity on December 1, 2037. Upon such tender, we can re-market the bonds as either fixed-rate bonds for a specified period or as variable-rate bonds until their final maturity. We also entered into a total return swap agreement that effectively converts the fixed-rate obligation on the bonds to a floating U.S.-dollar LIBOR-based rate. We have elected to account for the 2007 Arizona bonds at fair value. For further discussion, see Note 5: Fair Value. In 2005, we guaranteed repayment of principal and interest on bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona, which constitutes an unsecured general obligation for Intel. The principal amount, excluding the premium, of the bonds issued in 2005 was $157 million. The 2005 Arizona bonds were mandatorily tendered and repaid on November 30, 2010. The bonds bore interest at a fixed rate of 4.375%. In the future, we may re-market the bonds as either fixed-rate bonds for a specified period or as variable-rate bonds until their final maturity on December 1, 2035. As of December 25, 2010, our aggregate debt maturities based on outstanding principal were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START      Year Payable $  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016 and thereafter 3,725 Total $ 3,725 ##TABLE_END Substantially all of the difference between the total aggregate debt maturities above and the total carrying amount of our debt is due to the unamortized discount of our convertible debentures. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 22: Retirement Benefit Plans Retirement Contribution Plans We provide tax-qualified retirement contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. and certain other countries. The plans, which are funded by annual discretionary contributions from Intel, are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) determines the amounts to be contributed to the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan, formerly known as the U.S. Profit Sharing Plan, under delegation of authority from our Board of Directors, pursuant to the terms of the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan. As of December 25, 2010, 56% of our U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan was invested in equities, 38% was invested in fixed-income instruments, and 6% was invested in real assets. A substantial majority of assets are managed by external investment managers. For the benefit of eligible U.S. employees, we also provide a non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees. This plan is designed to permit certain discretionary employer contributions and to permit employee deferral of a portion of compensation in addition to their Intel 401(k) Savings Plan deferrals. This plan is unfunded. We expensed $319 million for the qualified and non-qualified U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan in 2010 ($260 million in 2009 and $289 million in 2008). In the first quarter of 2011, we funded $297 million for the 2010 contribution to the qualified U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans U.S. Pension Benefits. We provide a tax-qualified defined-benefit pension plan, the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan, for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. The U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan benefit is determined by a participants years of service and final average compensation (taking into account the participants social security wage base), reduced by the participants balance in the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan (which is funded by discretionary employer contributions). The plan generates a minimum pension benefit if the participants U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan benefit exceeds the annuitized value of his or her U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan benefit. If participant balances in the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan do not grow sufficiently, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan could increase significantly. As of January 1, 2011 (the effective date), Intel closed its U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan and U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan to employees hired on or after the effective date. Employees hired on or after the effective date will receive discretionary employer contributions via the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan. Non-U.S. Pension Benefits. We also provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain other countries. Consistent with the requirements of local law, we deposit funds for certain plans with insurance companies, with third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts, and/or accrue for the unfunded portion of the obligation. U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits. Upon retirement, eligible U.S. employees are credited with a defined dollar amount, based on years of service, into a U.S. Sheltered Employee Retirement Medical Account (SERMA). In 2010, we approved a plan amendment, effective January 1, 2011, to expand use of these credits to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase coverage in the retirees choice of medical plan. Prior to 2011, these credits could only be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase coverage in an Intel-sponsored medical plan. If the available credits are not sufficient to pay the entire cost of the coverage, the remaining cost is the retirees responsibility. Funding Policy. Our practice is to fund the various pension plans and the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of U.S. federal laws and regulations or applicable local laws and regulations. Additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate. Depending on the design of the plan, local customs, and market circumstances, the liabilities of a plan may exceed qualified plan assets.

Included in the aggregate data in the following tables are the amounts applicable to our pension plans, with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, as well as plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. Amounts related to such plans as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 were as follows: ##TABLE_START                  U.S. Pension Non-U.S. Pension Benefits Benefits (In Millions) 2010 2009 2010 2009 Plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets: Accumulated benefit obligations $  $  $ 241 $ 198 Plan assets $  $  $ 73 $ 68 Plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets: Projected benefit obligations $ 739 $ 567 $ 665 $ 258 Plan assets $ 569 $ 411 $ 369 $ 70 ##TABLE_END Assumptions Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 were as follows: ##TABLE_START                          U.S. Pension Non-U.S. Pension U.S. Postretirement Benefits Benefits Medical Benefits 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Discount rate 5.8 % 6.1 % 5.1 % 5.7 % 5.6 % 6.3 % Rate of compensation increase 4.7 % 5.1 % 4.5 % 3.6 % n/a n/a ##TABLE_END Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine costs for the plans were as follows: ##TABLE_START                                      U.S. Pension Non-U.S. Pension U.S. Postretirement Benefits Benefits Medical Benefits 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Discount rate 6.1 % 6.7 % 5.6 % 5.6 % 5.5 % 5.2 % 6.3 % 6.8 % 5.6 % Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 4.5 % 4.5 % 5.1 % 6.2 % 6.7 % 6.5 % n/a n/a n/a Rate of compensation increase 5.1 % 5.0 % 5.0 % 3.6 % 3.4 % 4.3 % n/a n/a n/a ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the U.S. plans, we developed the discount rate by calculating the benefit payment streams by year to determine when benefit payments will be due. We then matched the benefit payment streams by year to the AA corporate bond rates to match the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments and discounted back to the measurement date to determine the appropriate discount rate. For the non-U.S. plans, we used two approaches to develop the discount rate. In certain countries, we used a model consisting of a theoretical bond portfolio for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximated the estimated benefit payments of our pension plans. In other countries, we analyzed current market long-term bond rates and matched the bond maturity with the average duration of the pension liabilities. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions take into consideration both duration and risk of the investment portfolios, and are developed through consensus and building-block methodologies. The consensus methodology includes unadjusted estimates by the fund manager on future market expectations by broad asset classes and geography. The building-block approach determines the rates of return implied by historical risk premiums across asset classes. In addition, we analyzed rates of return relevant to the country where each plan is in effect and the investments applicable to the plan, expectations of future returns, local actuarial projections, and the projected long-term rates of return from external investment managers. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets shown for the non-U.S. plan assets is weighted to reflect each countrys relative portion of the non-U.S. plan assets. Net Periodic Benefit Cost The net periodic benefit cost for the plans included the following components: ##TABLE_START                                      U.S. Pension Non-U.S. Pension U.S. Postretirement Benefits Benefits Medical Benefits (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Service cost $ 38 $ 12 $ 14 $ 40 $ 47 $ 64 $ 16 $ 12 $ 12 Interest cost 34 35 16 35 37 42 14 11 12 Expected return on plan assets (18 ) (13 ) (11 ) (34 ) (31 ) (39 )    Amortization of prior service cost    1 (4 )  6 4 4 Recognized net actuarial loss (gain) 18 22 1 5 9 6 (1 ) (4 )  Recognized curtailment gains     (6 ) (4 )    Recognized settlement losses     6 17    Net periodic benefit cost $ 72 $ 56 $ 20 $ 47 $ 58 $ 86 $ 35 $ 23 $ 28 ##TABLE_END U.S. Pension Plan Assets In general, the investment strategy for U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets is to maximize risk-adjusted returns, taking into consideration the investment horizon and expected volatility, to ensure that there are sufficient assets available to pay pension benefits as they come due. When deemed appropriate, we may invest a portion of the funds in futures contracts for the purpose of acting as a temporary substitute for an investment in a particular equity security. The fund does not engage in speculative futures transactions. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 80% to 90% for fixed-income debt instrument investments and 10% to 20% for domestic and international equity fund investments. The expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets is 5.5%. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following investment categories as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009: ##TABLE_START                  December 25, 2010 Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using (In Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Equity securities: U.S. Large Cap Stock Fund $  $ 36 $  $ 36 U.S. Small Cap Stock Fund  9  9 International Stock Fund 11 30  41 Fixed income: U.S. treasuries  261  261 U.S. corporate bonds  79  79 Global Bond Fundcommon collective trusts  62  62 Global Bond Fundother 21 60  81 Total U.S. pension plan assets at fair value $ 32 $ 537 $  $ 569 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START                  December 26, 2009 Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using (In Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Equity securities: U.S. Large Cap Stock Fund $  $ 25 $  $ 25 U.S. Small Cap Stock Fund  7  7 International Stock Fund  31  31 Fixed income: U.S. treasuries  182  182 U.S. corporate bonds  65  65 Global Bond Fundcommon collective trusts  53  53 Global Bond Fundother 15 33  48 Total U.S. pension plan assets at fair value $ 15 $ 396 $  $ 411 ##TABLE_END The U.S. treasuries category in the preceding tables represents two common collective trust funds that seek to replicate the performance of the Barclays Capital U.S. 13 Year Treasury Bond Index and Barclays Capital U.S. 13 Year Agency Bond Index over the long term. The U.S. corporate bonds category in the preceding tables represents a common collective trust fund that seeks to replicate the performance of the Barclays Capital U.S. 13 Year Credit Bond Index over the long term. The Global Bond Funds target allocation is approximately 40% of assets in government and high-quality corporate bonds and asset-backed securities to mitigate risks related to deflation, 15% in global inflation-indexed bonds to provide protection from inflation, and another 15% in international government and corporate bonds. The residual 30% of the fund is allocated to opportunistic bond investments, which are used to enhance return and provide diversification. Such opportunistic bond investments include emerging market debt instruments with un-hedged currency exposure, high-yield investments, asset- and mortgage-backed securities, and corporate credit. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Non-U.S. Plan Assets The investments of the non-U.S. plans are managed by insurance companies, third-party trustees, or pension funds, consistent with regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. The investment manager evaluates performance by comparing the actual rate of return to the return on other similar assets. Investments managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under standard contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we have discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equities and fixed-income debt instruments, either through index funds or direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or individual securities in order to reduce market risk and assure that the pension assets are available to pay benefits as they come due. The average expected long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plan assets is 6.4%. Non-U.S. plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following investment categories as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009: ##TABLE_START                  December 25, 2010 Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using (In Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Equity securities: Global equities $ 165 $ 75 $  $ 240 Real estate   10 10 Non-U.S. venture capital   2 2 Fixed income: Non-U.S. government bonds  150  150 Investments held by insurance companies  202  202 Insurance contracts   28 28 Total assets measured at fair value $ 165 $ 427 $ 40 $ 632 Cash 10 Total non-U.S. plan assets at fair value $ 642 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START                  December 26, 2009 Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using (In Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Equity securities: Global equities $ 149 $ 60 $  $ 209 Real estate  7 14 21 Non-U.S. venture capital   2 2 Fixed income: Non-U.S. government bonds  116  116 Investments held by insurance companies  167  167 Insurance contracts   25 25 Total assets measured at fair value $ 149 $ 350 $ 41 $ 540 Cash 12 Total non-U.S. plan assets at fair value $ 552 ##TABLE_END The majority of the assets in the Global equities category in the preceding tables are invested in a diversified mix of equities of developed countries, including the U.S., and emerging markets throughout the world. Investment assets managed by qualified insurance companies (the Investments held by insurance companies and Insurance contracts categories in the preceding tables) are invested as part of the insurance companies general fund. We do not have control over the target allocation or visibility of the investment strategies of those investments. Insurance contracts and investments held by insurance companies made up 36% of total non-U.S. plan assets as of December 25, 2010 (35% as of December 26, 2009). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following table presents a reconciliation for the non-U.S. plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for 2010: ##TABLE_START              Non-U.S. Real Venture Insurance (In Millions) Estate Capital Contracts Balance as of December 26, 2009 $ 14 $ 2 $ 25 Realized and unrealized return on plan assets 3  2 Purchases, sales, and settlements, net (7 )  1 Balance as of December 25, 2010 $ 10 $ 2 $ 28 ##TABLE_END The target allocation of the non-U.S. plan assets that we have control over is 61% equity securities and 39% fixed-income instruments. U.S. Postretirement Medical Plan Assets In general, the investment strategy for U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets is to primarily invest in liquid assets due to the level of expected future benefit payments. The expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets is 3.0%. As of December 25, 2010, all of the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets were invested in a money market fund that complies with Rule 2A-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. Concentrations of Risk We manage a variety of risks, including market, credit, and liquidity risks, across our plan assets through our investment managers. We define a concentration of risk as an undiversified exposure to one of the above-mentioned risks that increases the exposure of the loss of plan assets unnecessarily. We monitor exposure to such risks in both the U.S. and non-U.S. plans by monitoring the magnitude of the risk in each plan and diversifying our exposure to such risks across a variety of instruments, markets, and counterparties. As of December 25, 2010, we did not have concentrations of risk in any single entity, manager, counterparty, sector, industry, or country. Funding Expectations Under applicable law for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan, we are not required to make any contributions during 2011. Our expected funding for the non-U.S. plans during 2011 is approximately $55 million. We expect employer contributions to the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan to be approximately $1 million during 2011. Estimated Future Benefit Payments We expect the average benefits to be paid through 2020 from the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan to be approximately $90 million annually. Note 23: Commitments A portion of our capital equipment and certain facilities are under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2028. Additionally, portions of our land are under leases that expire at various dates through 2062. Rental expense was $124 million in 2010 ($120 million in 2009 and $141 million in 2008). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Minimum rental commitments under all non-cancelable leases with an initial term in excess of one year were as follows as of December 25, 2010 (in millions): ##TABLE_START      Year Payable $ 102 2012 86 2013 56 2014 32 2015 20 2016 and thereafter 31 Total $ 327 ##TABLE_END Commitments for construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment totaled $4.6 billion as of December 25, 2010 ($1.8 billion as of December 26, 2009), most of which will be due within the next year. Other purchase obligations and commitments totaled approximately $600 million as of December 25, 2010 (approximately $900 million as of December 26, 2009). Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses, agreements to purchase raw materials or other goods, and payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include, for example, agreements to fund various projects with other companies. In addition, we have various contractual commitments with Micron and IMFT/IMFS. For further information on these contractual commitments, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments. Note 24: Employee Equity Incentive Plans Our equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. In May 2009, stockholders approved an extension of the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan). Stockholders approved 134 million additional shares for issuance, increasing the total shares of common stock available for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors to 428 million shares. The approval also extended the expiration date of the 2006 Plan to June 2012. The maximum number of shares to be awarded as non-vested shares (restricted stock) or non-vested share units (restricted stock units) increased to 253 million shares. As of December 25, 2010, 190 million shares remained available for future grant under the 2006 Plan. We may assume the equity incentive plans and the outstanding equity awards of certain acquired companies. Once they are assumed, we do not grant additional shares under those plans. Also in May 2009, stockholders approved an employee stock option exchange program (Option Exchange) to give employees (not listed officers) the opportunity to exchange eligible stock options for a lesser number of new stock options that have approximately the same fair value as the options surrendered, as of the date of the exchange. The Option Exchange commenced on September 28, 2009 and expired on October 30, 2009. Eligible options included stock options granted under any Intel stock option or equity incentive plan between October 1, 2000 and September 28, 2008 that had an exercise price above $20.83, which was the 52-week closing-price high as of October 30, 2009. A total of 217 million eligible stock options were tendered and cancelled in exchange for 83 million new stock options granted. The new stock options have an exercise price of $19.04, which is equal to the market price of Intel common stock (defined as the average of the high and low trading prices) on October 30, 2009. The new stock options were issued under the 2006 Plan and are subject to its terms and conditions. The new stock options vest in equal annual increments over a four-year period from the date of grant and will expire seven years from the grant date. Using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, we determined that the fair value of the surrendered stock options on a grant-by-grant basis was approximately equal, as of the date of the exchange, to the fair value of the eligible stock options exchanged, resulting in insignificant incremental share-based compensation. In 2009, we began issuing restricted stock units with both a market condition and a service condition (market-based restricted stock units), referred to in our 2010 Proxy Statement as outperformance stock units, to a small group of senior officers and non-employee directors. The number of shares of Intel common stock to be received at vesting will range from 33% to 200% of the target amount, based on total stockholder return (TSR) on Intel common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of a peer group over a three-year period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. As of December 25, 2010, there were 3 million market-based restricted stock units outstanding. These market-based restricted stock units accrue dividend equivalents and vest three years and one month from the grant date. In connection with our 2009 acquisition of Wind River Systems, we assumed the companys equity incentive plans and issued replacement awards in 2009. The stock options and restricted stock units issued generally retain the terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted. We will not grant additional shares under these plans. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Equity awards granted to employees in 2010 under our equity incentive plans generally vest over 4 years from the date of grant, and options expire 7 years from the date of grant, with the exception of market-based restricted stock units and replacement awards related to acquisitions. Equity awards granted to key officers, senior-level employees, and key employees in 2010 may have delayed vesting beginning 3 to 5 years from the date of grant, and these options expire 7 to 10 years from the date of grant. The 2006 Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific dates. Under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan, we made 240 million shares of common stock available for issuance through August 2011. As of December 25, 2010, 140 million shares were available for issuance under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation recognized in 2010 was $917 million ($889 million in 2009 and $851 million in 2008). On a quarterly basis, we assess changes to our estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on our review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. We recognize the effect of adjustments made to the forfeiture rates, if any, for all expense amortization after January 1, 2006 in the period that we change the forfeiture estimate. The effect of forfeiture adjustments in 2008, 2009, and 2010 was not significant. The total share-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory as of December 25, 2010 was $48 million ($33 million as of December 26, 2009 and $46 million as of December 27, 2008). During 2010, the tax benefit that we realized for the tax deduction from share-based awards totaled $266 million ($119 million in 2009 and $147 million in 2008). We estimate the fair value of restricted stock unit awards with time-based vesting using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting. We estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock units using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant. We based the weighted average estimated values of restricted stock unit grants, as well as the weighted average assumptions that we used in calculating the fair value, on estimates at the date of grant, as follows: ##TABLE_START              2010 2009 2008 Estimated values $ 22.56 $ 14.63 $ 19.94 Risk-free interest rate 1.1 % 0.9 % 2.1 % Dividend yield 2.6 % 3.5 % 2.6 % Volatility 31 % 46 % n/a ##TABLE_END We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted under our equity incentive plans and rights to acquire stock granted under our stock purchase plan. We based the weighted average estimated values of employee stock option grants (excluding stock option grants in connection with the Option Exchange in 2009) and rights granted under the stock purchase plan, as well as the weighted average assumptions used in calculating these values, on estimates at the date of grant, as follows: ##TABLE_START                          Stock Options Stock Purchase Plan 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Estimated values $ 4.82 $ 4.72 $ 5.74 $ 4.71 $ 4.14 $ 5.32 Expected life (in years) 4.9 4.9 5.0 0.5 0.5 0.5 Risk-free interest rate 2.5 % 1.8 % 3.0 % 0.2 % 0.4 % 2.1 % Volatility 28 % 46 % 37 % 32 % 44 % 35 % Dividend yield 2.7 % 3.6 % 2.7 % 3.1 % 3.6 % 2.5 % ##TABLE_END We base the expected volatility on implied volatility, because we have determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. We use the simplified method of calculating expected life, due to significant differences in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to our historical grants. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Restricted Stock Unit Awards Information with respect to outstanding restricted stock unit (RSU) activity is as follows: ##TABLE_START          Weighted Average Number of Grant-Date (In Millions, Except Per RSU Amounts) RSUs Fair Value December 29, 2007 51.1 $ 20.24 Granted 32.9 $ 19.94 Vested (12.1 ) $ 19.75 Forfeited (4.6 ) $ 20.12 December 27, 2008 67.3 $ 20.18 Granted 60.0 $ 14.63 Assumed in acquisition 1.6 $ 17.52 Vested (20.1 ) $ 20.24 Forfeited (3.4 ) $ 18.19 December 26, 2009 105.4 $ 17.03 Granted 32.4 $ 22.56 Vested (34.6 ) $ 17.70 Forfeited (3.4 ) $ 17.98 December 25, 2010 99.8 $ 18.56 Expected to vest as of December 25, 2010 94.4 $ 18.54 ##TABLE_END The aggregate fair value of awards that vested in 2010 was $808 million ($320 million in 2009 and $270 million in 2008), which represents the market value of Intel common stock on the date that the restricted stock units vested. The grant date fair value of awards that vested in 2010 was $612 million ($407 million in 2009 and $239 million in 2008). The number of restricted stock units vested includes shares that we withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. Restricted stock units that are expected to vest are net of estimated future forfeitures. As of December 25, 2010, there was $1.2 billion in unrecognized compensation costs related to restricted stock units granted under our equity incentive plans. We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of 1.3 years. Stock Option Awards As of December 25, 2010, options outstanding that have vested and are expected to vest are as follows: ##TABLE_START                  Weighted Average Number of Weighted Remaining Aggregate Options Average Contractual Term Intrinsic Value (In Millions) Exercise Price (In Years) (In Millions) Vested 263.0 $ 21.03 2.3 $ 295 Expected to vest 114.2 $ 19.18 5.6 $ 248 Total 377.2 $ 20.47 3.3 $ 543 ##TABLE_END Aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price and $20.84, the closing price of Intel common stock on December 23, 2010, as reported on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, for all in-the-money options outstanding. Options outstanding that are expected to vest are net of estimated future option forfeitures. Options with a fair value of $240 million completed vesting during 2010 ($288 million during 2009 and $459 million during 2008). As of December 25, 2010, there was $220 million in unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options granted under our equity incentive plans. We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of 1.2 years.

Stock Purchase Plan Approximately 75% of our employees were participating in our stock purchase plan as of December 25, 2010. Employees purchased 17.2 million shares in 2010 for $281 million under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan (30.9 million shares for $344 million in 2009 and 25.9 million shares for $453 million in 2008). As of December 25, 2010, there was $13 million in unrecognized compensation costs related to rights to acquire common stock under our stock purchase plan. We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of one month. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 25: Common Stock Repurchases Common Stock Repurchase Program As of December 25, 2010, we had an ongoing authorization, amended in November 2005, from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $25 billion in shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions, and $4.2 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit. In January 2011, our Board of Directors increased the repurchase authorization limit by $10 billion. During 2010, we repurchased 70.3 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1.5 billion. During 2009, we utilized the majority of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2009 debentures to repurchase 88.2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1.7 billion (for further information on the issuance of the 2009 debentures, see Note 21: Borrowings). We repurchased 324 million shares at a cost of $7.1 billion during 2008. We have repurchased 3.4 billion shares at a cost of $70 billion since the program began in 1990. Our repurchases in 2010 and 2009 and a portion of our purchases in 2008 were executed in privately negotiated transactions. Restricted Stock Unit Withholdings We issue restricted stock units as part of our equity incentive plans. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. During 2010, we withheld 10.1 million shares (5.8 million shares during 2009 and 3.5 million shares during 2008) to satisfy $236 million ($92 million during 2009 and $78 million during 2008) of employees tax obligations. Although shares withheld are not issued, they are treated as common stock repurchases in our consolidated financial statements, as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. Note 26: Earnings Per Share We computed our basic and diluted earnings per common share as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 2010 2009 2008 Net income available to common stockholders $ 11,464 $ 4,369 $ 5,292 Weighted average common shares outstandingbasic 5,555 5,557 5,663 Dilutive effect of employee equity incentive plans 89 37 34 Dilutive effect of convertible debt 52 51 51 Weighted average common shares outstandingdiluted 5,696 5,645 5,748 Basic earnings per common share $ 2.06 $ 0.79 $ 0.93 Diluted earnings per common share $ 2.01 $ 0.77 $ 0.92 ##TABLE_END We computed our basic earnings per common share using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We computed diluted earnings per common share using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Net income available to participating securities was insignificant for all periods presented. Potentially dilutive common shares from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan. Potentially dilutive common shares are determined by applying the if-converted method for the 2005 debentures. However, as our 2009 debentures require settlement of the principal amount of the debt in cash upon conversion, with the conversion premium paid in cash or stock at our option, potentially dilutive common shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method. For further discussion on the specific conversion features of our 2005 and 2009 debentures, see Note 21: Borrowings. For 2010, we excluded 161 million outstanding weighted average stock options (486 million in 2009 and 484 million in 2008) from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the exercise prices of these stock options were greater than or equal to the average market value of the common shares. These options could be included in the calculation in the future if the average market value of the common shares increases and is greater than the exercise price of the options. We also excluded our 2009 debentures from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the conversion option of the debentures was anti-dilutive. In the future, we could have potentially dilutive shares if the average market price is above the conversion price.

INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 28: Taxes Income before taxes and the provision for taxes consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START              (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Income before taxes: U.S. $ 13,926 $ 3,229 $ 6,117 Non-U.S. 2,119 2,475 1,569 Total income before taxes $ 16,045 $ 5,704 $ 7,686 Provision for taxes: Current: Federal $ 4,049 $ 604 $ 2,781 State 51 (2 ) (38 ) Non-U.S. 359 336 345 Total current provision for taxes $ 4,459 $ 938 $ 3,088 Deferred: Federal $ 187 $ 355 $ (668 ) Other (65 ) 42 (26 ) Total deferred provision for taxes $ 122 $ 397 $ (694 ) Total provision for taxes $ 4,581 $ 1,335 $ 2,394 Effective tax rate 28.6 % 23.4 % 31.1 % ##TABLE_END The difference between the tax provision at the statutory federal income tax rate and the tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes (effective tax rate) was as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Percentages) 2010 2009 2008 Statutory federal income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Increase (reduction) in rate resulting from: Non-U.S. income taxed at different rates (3.4 ) (12.4 ) (4.2 ) European Commission fine  8.9  Settlements, effective settlements, and related remeasurements (0.3 ) (6.4 ) (1.3 ) Research and development tax credits (0.9 ) (2.0 ) (1.4 ) Domestic manufacturing deduction benefit (2.1 ) (1.5 ) (1.7 ) Deferred tax asset valuation allowanceunrealized losses (0.2 ) 0.2 3.4 Other 0.5 1.6 1.3 Effective tax rate 28.6 % 23.4 % 31.1 % ##TABLE_END Income in certain foreign countries is fully exempt from income taxes for a limited period of time due to eligible activities and certain capital investment actions. These full tax exemptions expire at various dates through 2020; however, the exemptions in certain countries are eligible for renewal. In 2010, the tax benefit attributable to tax holidays was $256 million with a $0.04 impact on diluted earnings per share. The tax holiday benefits for 2009 and 2008 were $115 million ($0.02 per diluted share) and $67 million ($0.01 per diluted share), respectively. During 2010, net income tax benefits attributable to equity-based compensation transactions that were allocated to stockholders equity totaled $40 million (net deficiencies of $41 million in 2009 and net benefits of $8 million in 2008). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at year-ends were as follows: ##TABLE_START          (In Millions) 2010 2009 Deferred tax assets Accrued compensation and other benefits $ 675 $ 568 Deferred income 240 228 Share-based compensation 782 774 Inventory 95 340 Unrealized losses on investments and derivatives 375 407 State credits and net operating losses 158 187 Investment in foreign subsidiaries  129 Capital losses  150 Other, net 544 386 Gross deferred tax assets 2,869 3,169 Valuation allowance (252 ) (329 ) Total deferred tax assets $ 2,617 $ 2,840 Deferred tax liabilities Property, plant and equipment $ (564 ) $ (817 ) Convertible debt (740 ) (708 ) Licenses and intangibles (135 ) (129 ) Investment in foreign subsidiaries (52 )  Other, net (275 ) (247 ) Total deferred tax liabilities $ (1,766 ) $ (1,901 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 851 $ 939 Reported as: Current deferred tax assets $ 1,488 $ 1,216 Non-current deferred tax assets 289 278 Non-current deferred tax liabilities (926 ) (555 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 851 $ 939 ##TABLE_END Non-current deferred tax assets are included within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The valuation allowance is based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. The valuation allowance as of December 25, 2010 included allowances related to unrealized state credit carry forwards of $156 million and depreciation expense and other matters related to our non-U.S. subsidiaries of $96 million. As of December 25, 2010, we had not recognized U.S. deferred income taxes on a cumulative total of $11.8 billion of undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. Determining the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to investments in these non-U.S. subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested is not practicable. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest those earnings in operations outside the U.S. Long-term income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and non-U.S. tax credits, and may also include other long-term tax liabilities that are not uncertain but have not yet been paid. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows: ##TABLE_START      (In Millions) December 29, 2007 $ 794 Settlements and effective settlements with tax authorities and related remeasurements (154 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods 72 Decreases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods (84 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during current period 116 December 27, 2008 $ 744 Settlements and effective settlements with tax authorities and related remeasurements (526 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods 28 Decreases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods (58 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during current period 32 December 26, 2009 $ 220 Settlements and effective settlements with tax authorities and related remeasurements (73 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods 28 Decreases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods (30 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during current period 71 December 25, 2010 $ 216 ##TABLE_END During 2010, we settled and effectively settled matters with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and certain state tax authorities related to tax positions taken during prior periods. The result of the settlements, effective settlements, and resulting remeasurements was a reduction of $73 million in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits ($526 million in 2009, $154 million in 2008), $48 million of which resulted in a tax benefit for 2010 ($366 million for 2009, $103 million for 2008). If the remaining balance of $216 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 25, 2010 ($220 million as of December 26, 2009) were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $124 million and a reduction of the effective tax rate ($101 million as of December 26, 2009). During all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of income. In 2009, we recognized a net benefit of $62 million, primarily due to the reversal of accrued interest and penalties related to settled and effectively settled matters described above (insignificant for 2010 and 2008). As of December 25, 2010, we had $49 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits ($55 million as of December 26, 2009). Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure on audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. However, given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. We file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and non-U.S. tax returns. For U.S. state and non-U.S. tax returns, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 1996. For U.S. federal tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2006. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 29: Contingencies Legal Proceedings We are currently a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted in this section. While management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm the companys financial position, cash flows, or overall trends in results of operations, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable rulings could include substantial monetary damages, and in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of intellectual property. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. It is also possible that we could conclude it is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers to settle one or more such matters, and any such settlement could include substantial payments; however, we have not reached this conclusion with respect to any particular matter at this time. Except as may be otherwise indicated, the outcomes in these matters are not reasonably estimable. A number of proceedings generally have challenged and continue to challenge certain of our competitive practices. The allegations in these proceedings vary and are described in more detail in the following paragraphs, but in general contend that we improperly condition price rebates and other discounts on our microprocessors on exclusive or near-exclusive dealing by some of our customers; claim that our software compiler business unfairly prefers Intel microprocessors over competing microprocessors and that, through the use of our compiler and other means, we have caused inaccurate and misleading benchmark results concerning our microprocessors to be disseminated; allege that we unfairly controlled the content and timing of release of various standard computer interfaces developed by Intel in cooperation with other industry participants; and accuse us of engaging in various acts of improper competitive activity in competing against what is referred to as general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs), including certain licensing practices and our actions in connection with developing and disclosing potentially competitive technology. We believe that we compete lawfully and that our marketing, business, intellectual property, and other challenged practices benefit our customers and our stockholders, and we will continue to conduct a vigorous defense in these proceedings. While we have settled some of these matters, the distractions caused by challenges to these practices from the remaining matters are undesirable, and the legal and other costs associated with defending and resolving our position have been and continue to be significant. We assume that these challenges could continue for a number of years and may require the investment of substantial additional management time and substantial financial resources to explain and defend our position. Government Competition Matters and Related Consumer Class Actions In 2001, the European Commission (EC) commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business practices to persuade clients to buy our microprocessors. Since that time, we have received numerous requests for information and documents from the EC, and we have responded to each of those requests. The EC issued a Statement of Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. In May 2009, the EC issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged conditional rebates and payments that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged payments to prevent sales of specific rival products. The EC imposed a fine in the amount of 1.06 billion ($1.447 billion as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and also ordered us to immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in the EC decision. In the second quarter of 2009, we recorded the related charge within marketing, general and administrative on the consolidated statements of income. We strongly disagree with the ECs decision, and we appealed the decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The EC filed an answer to our reply brief in November 2010. The courts decision, after additional briefing and oral argument, is expected in 2012. The EC decision exceeds 500 pages and does not contain specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision states that we should cease and desist from further conduct that, in the ECs opinion, would violate applicable law. We have taken steps, which are subject to the ECs ongoing review, to comply with that decision pending appeal. We opened discussions with the EC to better understand the decision and to explain changes to our business practices. Based on our current understanding and expectations, we do not believe that any such changes will be material to our financial position, results, or cash flows. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In June 2005, we received an inquiry from the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) requesting documents from our Korean subsidiary related to marketing and rebate programs that we entered into with Korean PC manufacturers. In February 2006, the KFTC initiated an inspection of documents at our offices in Korea. In September 2007, the KFTC served on us an Examination Report alleging that sales to two customers during parts of 20022005 violated Koreas Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act. In December 2007, we submitted our written response to the KFTC. In February 2008, the KFTCs examiner submitted a written reply to our response. In March 2008, we submitted a further response. In April 2008, we participated in a pre-hearing conference before the KFTC, and we participated in formal hearings in May and June 2008. In June 2008, the KFTC announced its intent to fine us approximately $25 million for providing discounts to Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and TriGem Computer Inc. In November 2008, the KFTC issued a final written decision concluding that our discounts had violated Korean antitrust law and imposing a fine on us of approximately $20 million, which we paid in January 2009. In December 2008, we appealed this decision by filing a lawsuit in the Seoul High Court seeking to overturn the KFTCs decision. We expect a decision from the court in 2011. In November 2009, the State of New York filed a lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The lawsuit alleges that we violated federal antitrust laws; the New York Donnelly Act, which prohibits contracts or agreements to monopolize; and the New York Executive Law, which proscribes underlying violations of federal and state antitrust laws. The lawsuit alleges that we engaged in a systematic worldwide campaign of illegal, exclusionary conduct to maintain monopoly power and prices in the market for x86 microprocessors through the use of various alleged actions, including exclusive or near-exclusive agreements from large computer makers in exchange for loyalty payments and bribes, and other alleged threats and retaliation. The plaintiff claims that our alleged actions harmed consumers, competition, and innovation. The lawsuit seeks a declaration that our alleged actions have violated the federal and New York antitrust laws and the New York Executive Law; an injunction to prevent further alleged unlawful acts; unspecified damages in an amount to be proven at trial, trebled as provided for by law, restitution, and disgorgement; $1 million for each violation of the Donnelly Act proven by the plaintiff, and attorneys fees and costs. In January 2010, we filed our answer. In December 2010, the N.Y. Attorney Generals staff requested the courts permission to amend its complaint to expand the scope of parties covered by its Donnelly Act and Executive Law claims. Intel filed an opposition to the motion, and a hearing is scheduled for May 2011. We disagree with the plaintiffs allegations and claims in both the original complaint and the proposed amended complaint, and intend to conduct a vigorous defense of the lawsuit. The court has set a trial to begin on this matter in February 2012. In June 2008, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a formal investigation into our sales practices. In December 2009, three FTC Commissioners voted to issue an administrative complaint alleging that we had violated Section 5 of the FTC Act by engaging in unfair methods of competition and unfair acts or practices in markets for CPUs and GPUs. In November 2010, the FTC publicly announced the final approval to a settlement between Intel and the FTC that fully resolves the FTCs 2009 lawsuit against Intel. Among other provisions, the agreement includes: a statement that the agreement does not constitute an admission that Intel has violated the law or that the facts alleged in the complaint are true; provisions with respect to the treatment and extension of certain intellectual property agreements between Intel and AMD, Intel and NVIDIA Corporation, and Intel and VIA Technologies, Inc.; provisions with respect to Intels sales, marketing, pricing, and promotional activities for certain Intel microprocessors and chipsets; provisions concerning engineering and design changes to certain Intel products; provisions concerning Intels actions with respect to product roadmaps; disclosure and other terms with respect to Intels compilers and related products; and provisions related to compliance with the agreement. Intel continues to disagree with the FTCs allegations that Intel has violated any law. Nevertheless, Intel believes that the settlement is appropriate and in the best interests of its stockholders, employees, and customers. Based on our current understanding and expectations, we do not believe that any changes in our business practices to comply with the agreement will be material to our financial position, results, or cash flows. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) At least 82 separate class actions have been filed in the U.S. District Courts for the Northern District of California, Southern District of California, District of Idaho, District of Nebraska, District of New Mexico, District of Maine, and District of Delaware, as well as in various California, Kansas, and Tennessee state courts. These actions generally repeat the allegations made in a now-settled lawsuit filed against Intel by AMD in June 2005 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (AMD litigation). Like the AMD lawsuit, these class-action suits allege that Intel engaged in various actions in violation of the Sherman Act and other laws by, among other things, providing discounts and rebates to our manufacturer and distributor customers conditioned on exclusive or near exclusive dealings that allegedly unfairly interfered with AMDs ability to sell its microprocessors, interfering with certain AMD product launches, and interfering with AMDs participation in certain industry standards-setting groups. The class actions allege various consumer injuries, including that consumers in various states have been injured by paying higher prices for computers containing our microprocessors. All of the federal class actions and the Kansas and Tennessee state court class actions have been consolidated by the Multidistrict Litigation Panel to the District of Delaware, and the court has appointed a Special Master to address issues in the litigation as assigned by the court. In January 2010, the plaintiffs in the Delaware action filed a motion for sanctions for our failure to preserve evidence. This motion largely copies a motion previously filed by AMD in the AMD litigation, which has settled. The plaintiffs in the coordinated actions also moved for certification of a class of members who purchased certain personal computers containing products sold by Intel. In July 2010, the Special Master issued a Report and Recommendation (Class Report) denying the motion to certify a class. The plaintiffs filed objections to the Special Masters Class Report, and a hearing on these objections is scheduled for March 2011. All California class actions have been consolidated to the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County. The plaintiffs in the California actions have moved for class certification, which we are in the process of opposing. At our request, the court in the California actions has agreed to delay ruling on this motion until after the Delaware District Court rules on the similar motion in the coordinated actions. We dispute the class-action claims and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. Antitrust Derivative Litigation and Related Matters In February 2008, Martin Smilow filed a putative stockholder derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against members of our Board of Directors. The complaint alleged generally that the Board allowed the company to violate antitrust and other laws, as alleged in the AMD litigation, and that those alleged Board-sanctioned activities harmed the company. The complaint repeated many of the allegations made in the AMD litigation and referenced various investigations by the EC, KFTC, and others. In February 2008, Evan Tobias filed a putative stockholder derivative suit in the same court against the Board containing many of the same allegations as the Smilow suit. In July 2008, the District Court ordered Smilow and Tobias to file a single, consolidated complaint. An amended consolidated complaint was filed in August 2008. In June 2009, the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the plaintiffs consolidated complaint with prejudice. In July 2009, Smilow and the Rosenfeld Family Foundation made a demand to inspect certain of our books and records pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and in November 2009, Smilow and the Rosenfeld Family Foundation filed an action in Delaware Chancery Court to enforce that demand. In June 2008, Christine Del Gaizo filed a putative stockholder derivative suit in the Santa Clara County Superior Court against the Board, a former director of the Board, and six of our officers, containing many of the same allegations as the Smilow/Tobias stockholder derivative suit. In August 2008, the Santa Clara County Superior Court entered a stipulated order staying the Del Gaizo action pending further order of the court. In November 2009, Charles Gilman filed a putative stockholder derivative suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against certain Intel Board members as well as three former Board members. In December 2009, the Louisiana Municipal Police Employee Retirement System (LMPERS) filed a putative stockholder derivative suit in the same court against the same defendants. In January 2010, the District Court ordered Gilman and LMPERS to file a single, consolidated complaint under the name In re Intel Corp. Derivative Litigation . An amended consolidated complaint was filed in February 2010, which makes many of the same allegations raised in the Smilow/Tobias and Del Gaizo suits, and additionally cites a number of excerpts from the ECs decision, points to the settlement of the AMD litigation as supposed evidence of damage to Intel, and incorporates by reference all of the allegations made in the lawsuit filed against us by the State of New York and all of the allegations made in the administrative complaint filed against us by the FTC. In March 2010, Alan Paris filed a putative stockholder derivative suit in Santa Clara County Superior Court against certain current Intel Board members as well as three former Board members. Pariss complaint makes many of the same allegations raised in In re Intel Corp. Derivative Litigation . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In May 2010, we entered into a stipulation of settlement to resolve all of the foregoing stockholder derivative litigation and related matters, except for the Del Gaizo lawsuit. The settlement was approved by the Delaware District Court in July 2010. Pursuant to the Delaware District Courts scheduling order, we provided notice of the settlement to Intel stockholders in June 2010. In August 2010, Intel stockholder Christine Del Gaizo appealed the District Courts final judgment approving the settlement of these derivative actions, but we subsequently entered into a settlement agreement with Del Gaizo pursuant to which the appeal was dismissed in December 2010. The settlement agreements did not significantly impact our results of operations or cash flows. In January 2011, the Santa Clara County Superior Court entered judgment dismissing the Del Gaizo lawsuit with prejudice on the ground that it was barred as a result of the settlement approved by the Delaware District Court in July 2010. That judgment and the two settlements bring all pending derivative litigation to a close. Intel Corporation v. NVIDIA Corporation In February 2009, Intel filed a declaratory judgment lawsuit against NVIDIA in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning a chipset patent license agreement signed by Intel and NVIDIA in 2004. The lawsuit sought a declaratory judgment that chipsets for Intel microprocessors with integrated memory controllers are not licensed products under the chipset agreement. NVIDIA denied Intels claims and in March 2009 filed counterclaims against Intel seeking a declaration that NVIDIA is licensed, alleging that Intel breached the chipset agreement by making false and misleading statements about NVIDIAs rights, and alleging that Intel breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by taking actions to deprive and hinder NVIDIAs sales of chipsets. NVIDIA sought substantial monetary damages and an order terminating Intels rights under a separate patent cross-license agreement signed by Intel and NVIDIA in 2004. In January 2011, we entered into an agreement with NVIDIA to cross-license certain patents and settle the existing litigation between the companies. Under the agreement, we received a license to all of NVIDIAs patents with a capture period that runs through March 2017. In exchange, we agreed to make payments totaling $1.5 billion to NVIDIA over six years ($300 million annually from 2011 through 2013, and $200 million annually from 2014 through 2016), which will be recognized as a liability totaling approximately $1.4 billion, on a discounted basis. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we recognized an expense of $100 million within marketing, general and administrative on the consolidated statements of income. The remaining amount, approximately $1.3 billion, will be recognized as an intangible asset in the first quarter of 2011 and will be amortized into cost of sales over future periods. Additionally, we granted NVIDIA a license to Intels patents subject to certain exclusions, including x86 products, certain chipsets, and certain flash memory technology products. Lehman Matter In November 2009, representatives of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) advised us informally that the Lehman bankruptcy estate was considering a claim against us arising from a 2008 contract between Intel and Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. (Lehman OTC). Under the terms of the 2008 contract, Intel prepaid $1.0 billion to Lehman OTC, in exchange for which Lehman OTC was required to purchase and deliver to Intel the number of shares of Intel common stock that could be purchased for $1.0 billion at the volume-weighted average price for the period August 26, 2008 to September 26, 2008. Lehman OTCs performance under the contract was secured by $1.0 billion of cash collateral. Under the terms of the contract, Lehman OTC was obligated to deliver approximately 50 million shares of our common stock to us on September 29, 2008. Lehman failed to deliver any shares of our common stock, and we exercised our right to setoff against the $1.0 billion collateral. Lehman OTC has not initiated any action against us to date, but in February 2010, Lehman served a subpoena on us in connection with this transaction. In September 2010, we entered into an agreement with Lehman that tolls any applicable statutes of limitations for 90 days and precludes the parties from commencing any formal proceedings to prosecute any claims against each other in any forum during that period. In October 2010, Lehman demanded that Intel pay it at least $417 million. We continue to believe that we acted appropriately under our agreement with Lehman OTC, and we intend to defend any claim to the contrary. We have agreed to extend the tolling agreement twice, and it is now in effect through May 2011. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Frank T. Shum v. Intel Corporation, Jean-Marc Verdiell, and LightLogic, Inc. We acquired LightLogic, Inc. in May 2001. Frank Shum subsequently sued us, LightLogic, and LightLogics founder, Jean-Marc Verdiell, claiming that much of LightLogics intellectual property is based on alleged inventions that Shum conceived while he and Verdiell were partners at Radiance Design, Inc. Shum has alleged claims for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent concealment, and breach of contract. Shum also seeks alleged correction of inventorship of seven patents acquired by us as part of the LightLogic acquisition. In January 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California denied Shums inventorship claim, and thereafter granted our motion for summary judgment on Shums remaining claims. In August 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the District Courts rulings and remanded the case for further proceedings. In October 2008, the District Court granted our motion for summary judgment on Shums claims for breach of fiduciary duty and fraudulent concealment, but denied our motion on Shums remaining claims. A jury trial on Shums remaining claims took place in November and December 2008. In pre-trial proceedings and at trial, Shum requested monetary damages against the defendants in amounts ranging from $31 million to $931 million, and his final request to the jury was for as much as $175 million. Following deliberations, the jury was unable to reach a verdict on most of the claims. With respect to Shums claim that he is the proper inventor on certain LightLogic patents now assigned to us, the jury agreed with Shum on some of those claims and was unable to reach a verdict regarding the remaining claims. In April 2009, the court granted defendants motions for judgment as a matter of law. Shum appealed that ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which heard oral arguments in August 2010 and affirmed the trial courts orders in favor of Intel in December 2010. In January 2011, Shum petitioned the Federal Circuit for a re-hearing and/or re-hearing en banc. We will file a response upon request by the Federal Circuit. We will continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously. Note 30: Operating Segment and Geographic Information As of December 25, 2010, our operating segments included: PC Client Group, Data Center Group, Embedded and Communications Group, Digital Home Group, Ultra-Mobility Group, NAND Solutions Group, Wind River Software Group, Software and Services Group, and Digital Health Group. Subsequent to year-end, we divested of the Digital Health Group. For further information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our President and Chief Executive Officer. The CODM allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about its revenue and operating income (loss). Our PC Client Group and our Data Center Group are reportable operating segments. We also aggregate and disclose the financial results of the following non-reportable operating segments, whose product lines are based on Intel  architecture: Embedded and Communications Group, Digital Home Group, and Ultra-Mobility Group. These aggregated operating segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have chosen to disclose the aggregation of these non-reportable operating segments in the other Intel architecture operating segments category. Revenue for our reportable and aggregated non-reportable operating segments is primarily related to the following product lines: ##TABLE_START   PC Client Group. Includes microprocessors and related chipsets and motherboards designed for the desktop (including high-end enthusiast PCs), notebook, and netbook market segments; and wireless connectivity products.   Data Center Group. Includes microprocessors and related chipsets and motherboards designed for the server, workstation, and storage computing market segments; and wired network connectivity products.   Other Intel architecture operating segments. Includes microprocessors and related chipsets for embedded applications and products designed for the ultra-mobile market segment, which includes various handheld devices; and products for the consumer electronics market segments. ##TABLE_END Our NAND Solutions Group, Wind River Software Group, Software and Services Group, and Digital Health Group operating segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments and are included within the other operating segments category. Revenue within the corporate category is primarily related to divested businesses for which discrete operating results are not reviewed by our CODM. This includes revenue related to our NOR flash memory, as well as revenue and expenses related to supply and service agreements that were entered into as part of the divestiture (see Note 16: Divestitures). We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments, and the expenses are included in the operating results reported below. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) During 2009, we incurred charges of $1.447 billion as a result of the fine from the EC and $1.25 billion as a result of our legal settlement with AMD. These charges were included in the corporate category. Additionally, the corporate category includes expenses and charges such as: ##TABLE_START   amounts included within restructuring and asset impairment charges;   a portion of profit-dependent compensation and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments;   results of operations of seed businesses that support our initiatives; and   acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. ##TABLE_END The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Except as discussed above, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole. Net revenue and operating income (loss) for the three years ended December 25, 2010 were as follows: ##TABLE_START              (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net revenue PC Client Group Microprocessor revenue $ 24,721 $ 19,914 $ 21,516 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 6,877 6,261 6,450 31,598 26,175 27,966 Data Center Group Microprocessor revenue 7,361 5,301 5,126 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 1,332 1,149 1,464 8,693 6,450 6,590 Other Intel architecture operating segments 1,784 1,402 1,763 Other operating segments 1,501 970 579 Corporate 47 130 688 Total net revenue $ 43,623 $ 35,127 $ 37,586 Operating income (loss) PC Client Group $ 13,304 $ 7,585 $ 9,419 Data Center Group 4,395 2,299 2,135 Other Intel architecture operating segments (60 ) (179 ) (63 ) Other operating segments (159 ) (284 ) (1,042 ) Corporate (1,892 ) (3,710 ) (1,495 ) Total operating income $ 15,588 $ 5,711 $ 8,954 ##TABLE_END In 2010, one customer accounted for 21% of our net revenue (21% in 2009 and 20% in 2008), while another customer accounted for 17% of our net revenue (17% in 2009 and 18% in 2008). The majority of the revenue from these customers was from the sale of microprocessors, chipsets, and other components by the PC Client Group and the Data Center Group operating segments.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Part IV, Item 15. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Intel Corporation at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Intel Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 18, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP San Jose, California February 18, 2011 REPORT OF ERNST  YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intel Corporation We have audited Intel Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Intel Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Intel Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2010 consolidated financial statements of Intel Corporation and our report dated February 18, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP San Jose, California February 18, 2011 INTEL CORPORATION FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY QUARTER (UNAUDITED) ##TABLE_START                  2010 for Quarter Ended (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) December 25 September 25 June 26 March 27 Net revenue $ 11,457 $ 11,102 $ 10,765 $ 10,299 Gross margin $ 7,406 $ 7,321 $ 7,235 $ 6,529 Net income $ 3,180 $ 2,955 $ 2,887 $ 2,442 Basic earnings per common share $ 0.57 $ 0.53 $ 0.52 $ 0.44 Diluted earnings per common share $ 0.56 $ 0.52 $ 0.51 $ 0.43 Dividends per common share Declared $  $ 0.315 $  $ 0.315 Paid $ 0.1575 $ 0.1575 $ 0.1575 $ 0.1575 Market price range common stock 1 High $ 21.91 $ 21.78 $ 24.22 $ 22.67 Low $ 18.87 $ 17.67 $ 19.93 $ 19.02 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START                  2009 for Quarter Ended (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) December 26 September 26 June 27 March 28 Net revenue $ 10,569 $ 9,389 $ 8,024 $ 7,145 Gross margin $ 6,840 $ 5,404 $ 4,079 $ 3,238 Net income (loss) $ 2,282 2 $ 1,856 $ (398 ) 3 $ 629 Basic earnings (loss) per common share $ 0.41 2 $ 0.34 $ (0.07 ) 3 $ 0.11 Diluted earnings (loss) per common share $ 0.40 2 $ 0.33 $ (0.07 ) 3 $ 0.11 Dividends per common share Declared $  $ 0.28 $  $ 0.28 Paid $ 0.14 $ 0.14 $ 0.14 $ 0.14 Market price range common stock 1 High $ 20.83 $ 20.32 $ 16.66 $ 15.82 Low $ 18.50 $ 15.94 $ 14.72 $ 12.08 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 Intels common stock (symbol INTC) trades on The NASDAQ Global Select Market.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on managements evaluation (with the participation of our CEO and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010, the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Managements assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. Based on our assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst  Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their attestation report, which is included at the end of Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

This continuum would give consumers a set of secure, consistent, engaging, and personalized computing experiences. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Positively impact the world through our actions and the application of our energy-efficient technology. ##TABLE_END We will use our core assets to meet these objectives. Our core assets include our silicon and process technology, our architecture and platforms, our global presence, our strong relationships across the industry, and our brand recognition. We believe that applying these core assets to our key focus areas provides us with the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers needs quickly. Some of our core assets and key focus areas are: ##TABLE_START   Silicon and Manufacturing Technology Leadership. We have long been a leader in silicon process technology and manufacturing, and we aim to continue our lead through investment and innovation in this critical area. We drive a regular two-year upgrade cycleintroducing a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramping the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. We refer to this as our tick-tock technology development cadence. Additionally, we aim to have the best process technology, and unlike most semiconductor companies, we primarily manufacture our products in our own facilities. This allows us to optimize performance, reduce our time to market, and scale new products more rapidly. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Architecture and Platforms. We are developing a wide range of solutions for devices that span the computing continuum, from PCs (including Ultrabook systems), tablets, and smartphones to in-vehicle infotainment systems and beyond. Users want computing experiences that are consistent and devices that are interoperable. Users and developers value consistency of architecture, which provides a common framework that allows for reduced time to market, with the ability to leverage technologies across multiple form factors. We believe that we can meet the needs of both users and developers by offering Intel  architecture-based computing solutions across the computing continuum.

We enable and advance the computing ecosystem by providing development tools and support to help software developers create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platforms. We seek to expedite growth in various market segments, such as the embedded market segment, through our software offerings. Additionally, we have collaborated with other companies to develop software platforms optimized for our Intel  Atom  processors and that support multiple hardware architectures as well as multiple operating systems. We also deliver solutions and services that help secure systems and networks around the world. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Customer Orientation. Our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of products based on the needs and expectations of our customers. In turn, our products help enable the design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   consumers. We offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured to work together to provide an optimized solution compared to components that are used separately. Additionally, we promote industry standards that we believe will yield innovation and improved technologies for users. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Strategic Investments. We make investments in companies around the world that we believe will generate financial returns, further our strategic objectives, and support our key business initiatives. Our investments, including those made through Intel Capital, generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital economy, create new business opportunities for Intel, and expand global markets for our products. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Stewardship. We are committed to developing energy-efficient technology solutions that can be used to address major global problems while reducing our environmental impact. We are also committed to helping transform education globally through our technology, program, and policy leadership, as well as funding through the Intel Foundation. In addition, we strive to cultivate a work environment in which engaged, energized employees can thrive in their jobs and in their communities. ##TABLE_END Our continued investment in developing our assets and execution on key focus areas will strengthen our competitive position as we enter and expand into new market segments. We believe that these new market segments will result in demand that is incremental to that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers, and Ultrabook systems. We also believe that increased Internet traffic and use of cloud computing create a need for greater server infrastructure, including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance and virtualization. Business Organization As of December 31, 2011, we managed our business through the following operating segments. For a description of our operating segments, see Note 30: Operating Segment and Geographic Information, in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  ##TABLE_START 2 ##TABLE_END Products Platforms We offer platforms that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, and may be enhanced by additional hardware, software, and services. A microprocessorthe central processing unit (CPU) of a computer systemprocesses system data and controls other devices in the system. We offer microprocessors with one or multiple processor cores. Multi-core microprocessors can enable improved multitasking and energy-efficient performance by distributing computing tasks across two or more cores. Our 2nd and 3rd generation Intel  Core processor families integrate graphics functionality onto the processor die. In contrast, some of our previous-generation processors incorporated a separate graphics chip inside the processor package. We also offer graphics functionality as part of a separate chipset outside the processor package. Processor packages may also integrate the memory controller. A chipset sends data between the microprocessor and input, display, and storage devices, such as the keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard drive or solid-state drive, and CD, DVD, or Blu-ray* drive. Chipsets extend the audio, video, and other capabilities of many systems and perform essential logic functions, such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks. Some chipsets may also include graphics functionality or a memory controller, for use with our microprocessors that do not integrate those system components. We offer and are continuing to develop System-on-Chip (SoC) products that integrate our core processing functions with other system components, such as graphics, audio, and video, onto a single chip. SoC products are designed to reduce total cost of ownership, provide improved performance due to higher integration and lower power consumption, and enable smaller form factors.

There are frequent product introductions, and these products are becoming increasingly capable. The competitive environment in the computing industry is in a constant state of flux, as customers and collaborators in one part of our business can quickly become competitors in another. New market segments can emerge rapidly. We are focused on our strategy to expand into market segments beyond our traditional PC and server businessesincluding consumer electronics devices, embedded applications, smartphones, and tabletswhere we face several incumbent suppliers. One of our important competitive advantages is the combination of our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities with our global architecture design teams. This network enables us to have more direct control over our processes, quality control, product cost, production timing, performance, and other factors. Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries and subcontractors such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. or GlobalFoundries Inc. for their manufacturing and assembly and test needs. Our process technology leadership allows us to shrink the size of our transistors, optimizing power and performance characteristics and improving our ability to add more transistors and features. This leads to more powerful, energy-efficient microprocessors. We believe that as the need for computing power in smartphones and tablets grows, our ability to add transistors will become an important competitive advantage for our offerings in those market segments. Our platforms primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, innovative design and features, price, quality and reliability, brand recognition, and availability. Other important competitive factors include development of the software ecosystem, security, connectivity, and compatibility with other devices in the computing continuum. The ability of our architecture to support multiple operating systems, including legacy environments based on x86, is an advantage in offering OEM customers operating system choices. We believe that our platform strategy to integrate multiple hardware and software technologies gives us a significant competitive advantage. For many years, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) has been our primary competitor in the market segments for platforms used in notebooks and desktops. AMD also competes with us in the server market segment along with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and Oracle Corporation. Companies offering ARM Limited (ARM) based designs are also attempting to expand into the notebook, desktop, and server market segments. In addition, our platforms with integrated graphics and chipsets compete with NVIDIA Corporations graphics processors; NVIDIA has shifted some of the workload traditionally performed by the microprocessor to its graphics processor. Companies using ARM or MIPS Technologies, Inc. (MIPS) based designs are our primary competitors in the consumer electronics devices and embedded applications market segments. In smartphones and tablets, we face established competitors such as QUALCOMM Incorporated, NVIDIA, and Texas Instruments Incorporated, which deliver SoC solutions based on the ARM architecture and complementary wireless technologies, as well as companies that incorporate SoC solutions that they manufacture. The primary competitor for McAfees family of security products and services is Symantec Corporation. Manufacturing and Assembly and Test As of December 31, 2011, 78% of our wafer fabrication, including microprocessors and chipsets, was conducted within the U.S. at our facilities in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, and Massachusetts. The remaining 22% of our wafer fabrication was conducted outside the U.S. at our facilities in Ireland, China, and Israel. As of December 31, 2011, we primarily manufactured our products in wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations: ##TABLE_START Products  Wafer Size  Process Technology  Locations Microprocessors  300mm  22nm  Oregon, Arizona, Israel Microprocessors and chipsets  300mm  32nm  New Mexico, Arizona, Oregon Microprocessors  300mm  45nm  New Mexico Chipsets  300mm  65nm  Ireland, Arizona, China Chipsets, microprocessors, and other products  300mm  90nm  Ireland Chipsets  200mm  130nm  Massachusetts ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START 6 ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2011, a substantial majority of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300-millimeter (mm) wafers using our 32nm process technology. In the second half of 2011, we began manufacturing microprocessors using our 22nm process technology. As we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology, we incur significant start-up costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing. However, continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs. The benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor, reducing heat output from each transistor, and increasing the number of integrated features on each chip. These advancements can result in microprocessors that are higher performing, consume less power, and cost less to manufacture. In addition, with each shift to a new process technology, we are able to produce more microprocessors per square foot of our wafer fabrication facilities. The costs to develop our process technology are significantly less than adding capacity by building additional wafer fabrication facilities using older process technology. We use third-party manufacturing companies (foundries) to manufacture wafers for certain components, including networking and communications products. In addition, we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture board-level products and systems, and purchase certain communications networking products and mobile phone components from external vendors primarily in the Asia-Pacific region. Following the manufacturing process, the majority of our components are subject to assembly and test. We perform our components assembly and test at facilities in Malaysia, China, Costa Rica, and Vietnam. To augment capacity, we use subcontractors to perform assembly of certain products, primarily chipsets and networking and communications products. In addition, we use subcontractors to perform assembly and test of our mobile phone components. Our NAND flash memory products are manufactured by IMFT and IMFS using 20nm, 25nm, 34nm, or 50nm process technology, and assembly and test of these products is performed by Micron Technology, Inc. and other external subcontractors. For further information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our employment practices are consistent with, and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by, local country law. In addition, we impose a minimum employee age requirement as well as progressive Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) requirements, regardless of local law. We have thousands of suppliers, including subcontractors, providing our various materials and service needs. We set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments. We communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary. We seek, where possible, to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources, but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country. In those cases, we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply. We have entered into long-term contracts with certain suppliers to ensure a portion of our silicon supply. Our products are typically produced at multiple Intel facilities at various sites around the world, or by subcontractors that have multiple facilities. However, some products are produced in only one Intel or subcontractor facility, and we seek to implement action plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Research and Development We are committed to investing in world-class technology development, particularly in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits. Research and development (RD) expenditures were $8.4 billion in 2011 ($6.6 billion in 2010 and $5.7 billion in 2009). Our RD activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations (such as three-dimensional Tri-Gate and Hi-k metal gate transistor technologies) that we believe will deliver our next generation of products, which will in turn enable new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers. Our RD activities range from designing and developing new products and manufacturing processes to researching future technologies and products. We are focusing our RD efforts on advanced computing technologies, developing new microarchitectures, advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology, delivering the next generation of microprocessors and chipsets, improving our platform initiatives, and developing software solutions and tools to support our technologies. Our RD efforts enable new levels of performance and address areas such as energy efficiency, security, scalability for multi-core architectures, system manageability, and ease of use. We continue to make significant RD investments in the development of SoCs to enable growth in areas such as smartphones, tablets, and embedded applications. In addition, we continue to make significant investments in wireless technologies, graphics, and high-performance computing.  ##TABLE_START 7 ##TABLE_END As part of our RD efforts, we plan to introduce a new microarchitecture for our notebook, Ultrabook system, desktop, and Intel Xeon processors approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. We refer to this as our tick-tock technology development cadence. In 2011, we started manufacturing products (formerly code named Ivy Bridge) using our new 22nm three-dimensional Tri-Gate transistor process technology (22nm process technology). This technology is the first to use a three-dimensional transistor design, which is expected to improve performance and energy efficiency compared to the existing two-dimensional transistor structure, and significantly decreases the power targets for notebook processors. We expect to begin manufacturing products using a new microarchitecture using our 22nm process technology in 2012. We are currently developing 14nm process technology, our next-generation process technology, and expect to begin manufacturing products using that technology in 2013. Our leadership in silicon technology has enabled us to make Moores Law a reality. Moores Law predicted that transistor density on integrated circuits would double about every two years.  Our leadership in silicon technology has also helped expand on the advances anticipated by Moores Law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products optimized for a wider variety of applications. We have accelerated the Intel Atom processor-based SoC roadmap for netbooks, smartphones, tablets, and other devices, from 32nm through 22nm to 14nm within three successive years. Intel Atom processors will eventually be on the same process technology as our leading-edge products. We expect that this acceleration will result in a significant reduction in transistor leakage, lower active power, and an increase in transistor density to enable more powerful smartphones, tablets, and netbooks with more features and longer battery life. Our RD model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies, leading standards initiatives, and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies, including joint pathfinding conducted between researchers at Intel Labs and our business groups. We centrally manage key cross-business group product initiatives to align and prioritize our RD activities across these groups. In addition, we may augment our RD activities by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar RD focus areas, as well as directly purchasing intellectual property rights (IP) applicable to our RD initiatives. Employees As of December 31, 2011, we had 100,100 employees worldwide (82,500 as of December 25, 2010), with approximately 55% of those employees located in the U.S. (55% as of December 25, 2010). The majority of the increase in employees was due to employees hired as a result of the acquisitions of McAfee and the WLS business of Infineon. Sales and Marketing Customers We sell our products primarily to OEMs and ODMs. ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, we sell our products to other manufacturers, including makers of a wide range of industrial and communications equipment. Our customers also include those who buy PC components and our other products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customerssystems builders that purchase Intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors. We have a boxed processor program that allows distributors to sell Intel microprocessors in small quantities to these systems-builder customers; boxed processors are also available in direct retail outlets.  ##TABLE_START 8 ##TABLE_END In 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company accounted for 19% of our net revenue (21% in 2010 and 2009) and Dell Inc. accounted for 15% of our net revenue (17% in 2010 and 2009). No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue. For information about revenue and operating income by operating segment, and revenue from unaffiliated customers by geographic region/country, see Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 and Note 30: Operating Segment and Geographic Information in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Sales Arrangements Our products are sold through sales offices throughout the world. Sales of our products are typically made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, private-label branding, and other matters. Most of our sales are made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology. Our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer, even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related costs of sales is deferred. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, generally 30 days after shipment or delivery. Our credit department sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual customers to control credit risk to Intel arising from outstanding account balances. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis, and from this analysis, we establish credit limits and determine whether we will use one or more credit support devices, such as a third-party guarantee or standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. For information about our allowance for doubtful receivables, see Schedule IIValuation and Qualifying Accounts in Part IV of this Form 10-K. Most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. On most products, there is no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. We have the option to grant credit for, repair, or replace defective products, and there is no contractual limit on the amount of credit that may be granted to a distributor for defective products. Distribution Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. We also utilize third-party sales representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others. Sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory; instead, their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in close proximity to key customers. Backlog Over time, our larger customers have generally moved to lean-inventory or just-in-time operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products. We have arrangements with these customers to seek to quickly fill orders from regional warehouses. As a result, our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance non-binding commitments from customers as to future purchases. Our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Only a small portion of our orders is non-cancelable, and the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant. Seasonal Trends Our platform sales generally have followed a seasonal trend. Historically, our sales have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. Consumer and business purchases of PCs have historically been higher in the second half of the year.  ##TABLE_START 9 ##TABLE_END Marketing Our corporate marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known Intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel  Core processor family and the Intel Atom, Intel  Pentium  , Intel  Celeron  , Intel Xeon, and Intel  Itanium  trademarks make up our processor brands. We promote brand awareness and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities include television, print, and Internet advertising, as well as press relations, consumer and trade events, and industry and consumer communications. We market to consumer and business audiences, and focus on building awareness and generating demand for increased performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as Internet connectivity and security. Purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the Intel Inside  Program. This program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Through the Intel Inside Program, certain customers are licensed to place Intel logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses the OEMs for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to the OEMs meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include television, print, and Internet marketing. We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers. Intellectual Property Rights and Licensing IP that applies to our products and services includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, and maskwork rights. We maintain a program to protect our investment in technology by attempting to ensure respect for our IP. The extent of the legal protection given to different types of IP varies under different countries legal systems. We intend to license our IP where we can obtain adequate consideration. See Competition earlier in this section, Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, and Note 29: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We have obtained patents in the U.S. and other countries. While our patents are an important element of our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, and the comparative pace of governments patenting processes, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and may sometimes be obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted. As we expand our products into new industries, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other IP, may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our component-level and system-level products, is entitled to copyright protection. To distinguish Intel products from our competitors products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. In the first quarter of 2011, we entered into a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA. Under the agreement, we received a license to all of NVIDIAs patents with a capture period that runs through March 2017 while NVIDIA products are licensed to our patents, subject to exclusions for x86 products, certain chipsets, and certain flash memory technology products. Compliance with Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations Our compliance efforts focus on monitoring regulatory and resource trends and setting company-wide performance targets for key resources and emissions. These targets address several parameters, including product design; chemical, energy, and water use; waste recycling; the source of certain minerals used in our products; climate change; and emissions. Intel focuses on reducing natural resource use, the solid and chemical waste by-products of our manufacturing processes, and the environmental impact of our products. We currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of EHS laws and regulations. Over the past several years, we have significantly reduced the use of lead and halogenated flame retardants in our products and manufacturing processes.  ##TABLE_START 10 ##TABLE_END We work with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), non-governmental organizations, OEMs, and retailers to help manage e-waste (which includes electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives) and promote recycling. The European Union requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that allow consumers to return products for recycling. Many states in the U.S. have similar e-waste take-back laws. Although these laws are typically targeted at the end electronic product and not the component products that Intel manufactures, the inconsistency of many e-waste take-back laws and the lack of local e-waste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts. Intel is an industry leader in efforts to build ethical sourcing of minerals for our products. Intel has partnered with the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development to create pilot programs that would allow for tracking and tracing of our source materials, in particular those minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 2012, Intel will continue to work to establish a conflict-free supply chain for our company and our industry. Intels goal for 2012 is to verify that the tantalum we use in our microprocessors is conflict-free, and our goal for 2013 is to manufacture the worlds first verified, conflict-free microprocessor. Intel seeks to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers to improve energy efficiency. We take a holistic approach to power management, addressing the challenge at the silicon, package, circuit, micro/macro architecture, platform, and software levels. We recognize that climate change may cause general economic risk. For further information on the risks of climate change, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations. This could include items applied to utilities that are passed along to customers, such as carbon taxes or costs associated with obtaining permits for our U.S. manufacturing operations, emission cap and trade programs, or renewable portfolio standards. We are committed to sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives and working proactively with governments, environmental groups, and industry to promote global environmental sustainability. We believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the worlds environmental challenges, and we are joining forces with industry, business, and governments to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to combat climate change. We have been purchasing wind power and other forms of renewable energy at some of our major sites for several years. We purchase renewable energy certificates under a multi-year contract. The purchase has placed Intel at the top of the EPAs Green Power Partnership for the past four years and was intended to help stimulate the market for green power, leading to additional generating capacity and, ultimately, lower costs. Distribution of Company Information Our Internet address is www.intel.com . We publish voluntary reports on our web site that outline our performance with respect to corporate responsibility, including EHS compliance. We use our Investor Relations web site, www.intc.com, as a routine channel for distribution of important information, including news releases, analyst presentations, and financial information. We post filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K; our proxy statements; and any amendments to those reports or statements. All such postings and filings are available on our Investor Relations web site free of charge. In addition, our Investor Relations web site allows interested persons to sign up to automatically receive e-mail alerts when we post news releases and financial information. The SECs web site, www.sec.gov, contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END Changes in product demand may harm our financial results and are hard to predict. If product demand decreases, our revenue and profit could be harmed. Important factors that could cause demand for our products to decrease include changes in: ##TABLE_START   business conditions, including downturns in the computing industry, regional economies, and the overall economy; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   consumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the level of customers inventories; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   customer product needs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   market acceptance of our products and maturing product cycles; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the high-technology supply chain, including supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. ##TABLE_END Our operations have high costs, such as those related to facility construction and equipment, RD, and employment and training of a highly skilled workforce, that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. At the same time, demand for our products is highly variable. If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. Our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. Factory-planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation. If product demand increases, we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand. These changes in product demand, and changes in our customers product needs, could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us to write down our assets. We operate in highly competitive industries, and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological and market developments could harm our ability to compete. We operate in highly competitive industries that experience rapid technological and market developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to these developments, we may weaken our competitive position, and our products or technologies may be uncompetitive or obsolete. As computing market segments emerge, such as netbooks, smartphones, tablets, and consumer electronics devices, we face new sources of competition and customers with different needs than customers in our PC business. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships in these market segments. As the number and variety of Internet-connected devices increase, we need to improve the cost, connectivity, energy efficiency, and security of our platforms to succeed in these new market segments. And we need to expand our software capabilities in order to provide customers with complete computing solutions. To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful RD effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors. Our RD efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems, and we do not expect that all of our projects will be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers, and products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for our products. These types of events could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce revenue, increase costs, lower gross margin percentage, or require us to impair our assets. Changes in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results. Because of the wide price differences in notebook, netbook, smartphone, tablet, desktop, and server microprocessors, the mix of microprocessors sold affects the average selling prices of our products and has a large impact on our revenue and gross margin. Our financial results also depend on the mix of other products that we sell, such as chipsets, flash memory, and other semiconductor products. More recently introduced products tend to have higher costs because of initial development and production, and changes in the mix of products sold may affect our ability to recover our fixed costs and product investments. Our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our results of operations and financial condition. We have sales offices, RD, manufacturing, assembly and test facilities, and other facilities in many countries, and some business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas. As a result, our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products may be affected by: ##TABLE_START   security concerns, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, and terrorist activity; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   natural disasters and health concerns; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   inefficient and limited infrastructure and disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, or telecommunications providers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   restrictions on our operations by governments seeking to support local industries, nationalization of our operations, and restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   differing employment practices and labor issues; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 13 ##TABLE_END Legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, or agents may violate our policies. Although most of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses may be paid in local currencies. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates could harm our results and financial condition. Changes in tariff and import regulations and in U.S. and non-U.S. monetary policies may harm our results and financial condition by increasing our expenses and reducing revenue. Varying tax rates in different jurisdictions could harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our overall tax rate. We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. We place our insurance coverage with multiple carriers in numerous jurisdictions. However, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies have deductibles and exclusions that result in us retaining a level of self-insurance. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Failure to meet our production targets, resulting in undersupply or oversupply of products, may harm our business and results of operations. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. Disruptions in this process can result from errors; difficulties in our development and implementation of new processes; defects in materials; disruptions in our supply of materials or resources; and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditionsall of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. We may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes. Production issues may result in our failure to meet or increase production as desired, resulting in higher costs or large decreases in yields, which could affect our ability to produce sufficient volume to meet product demand. The unavailability or reduced availability of products could make it more difficult to deliver computing platforms. The occurrence of these events could harm our business and results of operations. We may have difficulties obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing, assembling and testing our products, or operating other aspects of our business, which could harm our ability to meet demand and increase our costs. We have thousands of suppliers providing materials that we use in production and other aspects of our business, and we seek, where possible, to have several sources of supply for all of those materials. However, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location, for these materials. The inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. Production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. Future environmental regulations could restrict the supply or increase the cost of materials that we use in our business and make it more difficult to obtain permits to build or modify manufacturing capacity to meet demand. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs. The occurrence of these events could harm our business and results of operations. Costs related to product defects and errata may harm our results of operations and business. Costs of product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) due to, for example, problems in our design and manufacturing processes, could include: ##TABLE_START   writing off the value of inventory; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   disposing of products that cannot be fixed; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   recalling products that have been shipped; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   providing product replacements or modifications; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   defending against litigation. ##TABLE_END These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin. Our reputation with customers or end users could be damaged as a result of product defects and errata, and product demand could be reduced. The announcement of product defects and errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of Intel components or for other reasons. These factors could harm our business and financial results.  ##TABLE_START 14 ##TABLE_END Third parties may attempt to breach our network security, which could damage our reputation and financial results. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or introduce malicious software to our IT systems. These attemptswhich might be the result of industrial or other espionage, or actions by hackers seeking to harm the company, its products, or end usersare sometimes successful. In part because of the high profile of our McAfee subsidiary in the network and system protection business, we might become a target of computer hackers who create viruses to sabotage or otherwise attack our products and services. Hackers might attempt to penetrate our network security and gain access to our network and our data centers, steal proprietary information, including personally identifiable information, or interrupt our internal systems and services. We seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. Third parties may claim infringement of IP, which could harm our business. We may face IP infringement claims from individuals and companies, including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies. We are engaged in a number of litigation matters involving IP. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP of others could cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. As a result of IP infringement claims, we could: ##TABLE_START   pay infringement claims; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   stop manufacturing, using, or selling products or technology subject to infringement claims; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   develop other products or technology not subject to infringement claims, which could be time-consuming and costly or may not be possible; or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   license technology from the party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. ##TABLE_END These actions could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed. We may be unable to enforce or protect our IP, which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business. Our ability to enforce our patents, copyrights, software licenses, and other IP is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we are often subject to claims that the IP is invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to the opposing party. Our assertion of IP often results in the other party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. Governments may adopt regulationsand governments or courts may render decisionsrequiring compulsory licensing of IP, or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business. We may be subject to IP theft or misuse, which could result in claims and harm our business and results of operations. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; the value of our investment in RD, product development, and marketing could be reduced; and third parties might make claims related to losses of confidential or proprietary information or end-user data, or system reliability. These incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm. Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights. Companies in the computing industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements between them. Our competitors may have licenses to our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our IP may be impaired. Litigation or regulatory proceedings could harm our business. We may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. As described in Note 29: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling products, engaging in business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents.  ##TABLE_START 15 ##TABLE_END We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added resellers, OEMs, Internet service providers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors). Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk, and compliance risks. Distributors may sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of FCPA or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position. We face risks related to sales to government entities. We derive a portion of our revenue from sales to government entities and their respective agencies. Government demand and payment for our products may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations. Government contracts are subject to oversight, including special rules on accounting, expenses, reviews, and security. Failing to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines and suspensions, or debarment from future government business. We invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments. We make investments in companies around the world to further strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. These investments include equity or debt instruments of public or private companies, and many of these instruments are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. Companies range from early-stage companies that are still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The companies in which we invest may fail because they may be unable to secure additional funding, obtain favorable terms for future financings, or participate in liquidity events such as public offerings, mergers, and private sales. If any of these private companies fail, we could lose all or part of our investment. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment, we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize a loss. We have large investments in the flash memory market segment, and declines in this market segment or changes in managements plans with respect to our investments in this market segment could result in large impairment charges, impacting gains (losses) on equity investments, net. When the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved, or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives, we may decide to dispose of the investment. We may incur losses on the disposal of non-marketable investments. For cases in which we are required under equity method accounting to recognize a proportionate share of another companys income or loss, such income or loss may impact earnings. Gains or losses from equity securities could vary from expectations, depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities, gains or losses from equity investments, and impairment charges for equity and other investments. Our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies. The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies have a large impact on our results of operations. For further information, see Critical Accounting Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. These methods, estimates, and judgments are subject to large risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and changes could affect our results of operations. Changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations. A number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including: ##TABLE_START   the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the resolution of issues arising from tax audits; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairments of goodwill; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   changes in available tax credits; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of foreign income and expenses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 16 ##TABLE_END Decisions about the scope of operations of our business could affect our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in the business environment could lead to changes in the scope of our operations, resulting in restructuring and asset impairment charges. Factors that could affect our results of operations and financial condition due to a change in the scope of our operations include: ##TABLE_START   timing and execution of plans and programs subject to local labor law requirements, including consultation with work councils; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   changes in assumptions related to severance and postretirement costs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   divestitures; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   new business initiatives and changes in product roadmap, development, and manufacturing; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   changes in employment levels and turnover rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   changes in product demand and the business environment; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   changes in the fair value of long-lived assets. ##TABLE_END Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and enter into agreements for possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions, such as joint ventures. Acquisitions and other transactions involve large challenges and risks, including risks that: ##TABLE_START   we may be unable to identify opportunities on terms acceptable to us; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the transaction may not advance our business strategy; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   we may not realize a satisfactory return; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   we may be unable to retain key personnel; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   we may experience difficulty in integrating new employees, business systems, and technology; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   acquired businesses may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our due diligence process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   we may have difficulty entering new market segments; or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   we may be unable to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses. ##TABLE_ENDWhen we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur added expense, or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, resulting in a loss on the transaction. If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to factors such as: ##TABLE_START   failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   IP disputes or other litigation; or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   difficulties obtaining financing for the transaction. ##TABLE_END Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could harm our business and results of operations. The manufacturing and assembling and testing of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of EHS laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in: ##TABLE_START   regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   suspension of production; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   alteration of our fabrication and assembly and test processes; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   restrictions on our operations or sales. ##TABLE_END Our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.  ##TABLE_START 17 ##TABLE_END Climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. In addition to the possible direct economic impact that climate change could have on us, climate change mitigation programs and regulations can increase our costs. The cost of perfluorocompounds (PFCs)a gas that we use in manufacturingcould increase under some climate-change-focused emissions trading programs that may be imposed by regulation. If the use of PFCs is prohibited, we would need to obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. Air-quality permit requirements for our manufacturing operations could become more burdensome and cause delays in our ability to modify or build additional manufacturing capacity. Under recently adopted greenhouse gas regulations in the U.S., many of our manufacturing facilities have become major sources under the Clean Air Act. At a minimum, this change in status results in some uncertainty as the EPA adopts guidance on its greenhouse gas regulations. Due to the dynamic nature of our operations, it is likely that these regulations will result in increased costs for our U.S. operations. These cost increases could be associated with new air pollution control requirements, and increased or new monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. We also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations. Our costs could increase if utility companies pass on their costs, such as those associated with carbon taxes, emission cap and trade programs, or renewable portfolio standards. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disasters or events. Many of our operations are located in semi-arid regions, such as Israel and the southwestern U.S. Some scenarios predict that these regions may become even more vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. A number of factors could lower interest and other, net, harming our results of operations. Factors that could lower interest and other, net in our income statements include changes in fixed-income, equity, and credit markets; foreign currency exchange rates; interest rates; credit standing of financial instrument counterparties; our cash and investment balances; and our indebtedness.  ##TABLE_START 18 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

These new facilities will allow us to widen our process technology lead as we focus on both 22nm and 14nm manufacturing process technology. We expect incremental opportunities in unit growth and product mix as a result of these new facilities. Outside the U.S., we have wafer fabrication at our facilities in Ireland, China, and Israel. Our assembly and test facilities are located in Malaysia, China, Costa Rica, and Vietnam. In addition, we have sales and marketing offices worldwide that are generally located near major concentrations of customers.

Overview Our results of operations were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    Three Months Ended   Twelve Months Ended  (Dollars in Millions)  Dec. 31, 2011   Oct. 1, 2011   Dec. 31, 2011   Dec. 25, 2010  Net revenue  $ 13,887   $ 14,233   $ 53,999   $ 43,623  Gross margin  $ 8,952   $ 9,018   $ 33,757   $ 28,491  Gross margin percentage   64.5 %   63.4 %   62.5 %   65.3 % Operating income  $ 4,599   $ 4,785   $ 17,477   $ 15,588  Net income  $ 3,360   $ 3,468   $ 12,942   $ 11,464  Diluted earnings per common share  $ 0.64   $ 0.65   $ 2.39   $ 2.01  ##TABLE_END  2011 was our most profitable year, with record revenue, operating income, net income, and earnings per share. Revenue of $54.0 billion was up $10.4 billion, or 24% from a year ago, and was our second year in a row with revenue growing over 20%. We saw growth in 2011 in both our client business and our data center business. Our client business is benefiting as rising incomes increase the affordability of PCs in emerging markets. Our data center business is benefiting as the increasing number of devices that compute and connect to the Internet drives the build-out of the cloud infrastructure. Additionally, we completed the acquisitions of McAfee and the WLS business of Infineon in 2011, which combined contributed approximately $3.6 billion to our revenue growth. Our 2011 gross margin percentage was down 2.8 percentage points compared to 2010. The decline was primarily driven by the increase in start-up costs associated with 22nm factories as well as the impact of acquisitions. These declines were partially offset by growth in our platform business. Our fourth quarter revenue of $13.9 billion was down $346 million from the third quarter of 2011. The floods in Thailand and the resulting hard disk drive supply shortage negatively impacted our fourth quarter revenue as our customers reduced inventories across the supply chain. We expect the shortage of hard disk drives to continue to impact our business in the first quarter of 2012. Compared to the third quarter of 2011, our fourth quarter gross margin was up 1.1 percentage points as a result of lower manufacturing costs (platform unit costs and other cost of sales), partially offset by higher platform write-offs.  ##TABLE_START 23 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Our strong financial performance during 2011 has allowed us to make significant investments in our business as well as increase the return of cash to our stockholders through common stock repurchases and dividends. For 2011, we generated a record $21.0 billion of cash from operations and ended the quarter with an investment portfolio of $14.8 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets. During 2011, we issued $5.0 billion of senior unsecured notes, primarily to repurchase shares of our common stock; repurchased $14.1 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program; purchased $10.8 billion in capital assets; spent $8.7 billion on acquisitions; and returned $4.1 billion to stockholders through dividends. In January 2012, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per common share for the first quarter of 2012. Looking ahead to 2012, we believe that the emerging market, the data center, and enterprise trends that drove our revenue in 2011 will continue to drive our business in 2012. In addition, we have a strong product and technology pipeline coming to market with the ramp of Ultrabook systems with the launch of our 22nm process technology microprocessors (code named Ivy Bridge), the launch of our new server platform (code named Romley), security, and Intel processor-powered smartphones and tablets. For 2012, we are also forecasting a gross margin increase of 1.5 percentage points, to 64%. We expect lower start-up costs, no impact from the Intel  6 Series Express Chipset design issue, and higher platform revenue. These increases to gross margin are expected to be partially offset by higher platform unit costs as we ramp Ivy Bridge. We are forecasting an increase in our investment in RD of approximately $1.8 billion as we make incremental investment in technologies for Ultrabook systems, data centers, smartphones, and tablets. Additionally, we are making investments in core capabilities such as security, SoCs, and extending our process technology leadership. We are forecasting an increase in capital spending to $12.5 billion, which is $1.7 billion higher than in 2011, as we build the worlds first high-volume manufacturing factories for 14nm process technology. We believe that this continued investment will allow our process technology and manufacturing advantage to continue to extend in 2012, enabling a leadership product portfolio. Our Business Outlook for 2012 includes our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending, and capital expenditures. We will keep our most current Business Outlook publicly available on our Investor Relations web site at www.intc.com . This Business Outlook is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in Business Outlook or in this Form 10-K. The public can continue to rely on the Business Outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we publish a notice stating otherwise. The statements in Business Outlook and forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times. The forward-looking statements in Business Outlook will be effective through the close of business on March 16, 2012 unless updated earlier. From the close of business on March 16, 2012 until our quarterly earnings release is published, presently scheduled for April 17, 2012, we will observe a quiet period. During the quiet period, Business Outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our Form 8-K filed on January 19, 2012, and other forward-looking statements disclosed in the companys news releases and filings with the SEC, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this Form 10-K, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. During the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our Business Outlook or our financial results or expectations. The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion. Critical Accounting Estimates The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: ##TABLE_START   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity investments, net when we record impairments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment; goodwill; and identified intangibles), which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment. ##TABLE_END Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved.  ##TABLE_START 24 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Non-Marketable Equity Investments We regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2011 ($2.6 billion as of December 25, 2010). Approximately half of this balance as of December 31, 2011 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment. Our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in IMFT and IMFS of $1.3 billion ($1.5 billion as of December 25, 2010). For additional information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. Our non-marketable equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success is dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, the ability of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile, and other key business factors. The companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings. These events could cause our investments to become impaired. In addition, financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. For further information about our investment portfolio risks, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for disclosure purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as projected revenue, earnings, and comparable performance multiples. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies sizes, growth rates, industries, development stages, and other relevant factors. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee: revenue; expenses, capital spending, and other costs; and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenue, expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed using available market, historical, and forecast data. The valuation of our non-marketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, the investees capital structures, the terms of the investees issued interests, and the lack of marketability of the investments. For non-marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment, such as: ##TABLE_START   the investees revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the technological feasibility of the investees products and technologies; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   factors related to the investees ability to remain in business, such as the investees liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. ##TABLE_END If the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine if the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value. Impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $63 million in 2011. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2011, impairments of non-marketable equity investments ranged from $8 million to $79 million per quarter.  ##TABLE_START 25 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Long-Lived Assets Property, Plant and Equipment We assess property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset groupings carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset groupings carrying value and its fair value. Property, plant and equipment is considered a non-financial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. Impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets new, shorter useful lives. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2011, impairments and accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment ranged from $10 million to $75 million per quarter. Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased operations to our existing business units as well as the acquired business unit. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in Note 30: Operating Segment and Geographic Information in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value. For reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. For reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. If, during this second step, we determine that the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of both the income and market methods to estimate the reporting units fair value. The income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following reporting unit estimates: revenue, based on assumed market segment growth rates and Intels assumed market segment share; estimated costs; and appropriate discount rates based on the reporting units weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. Our estimates of market segment growth, our market segment share, and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process. The same estimates are also used in planning for our long-term manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process, and for both long-term and short-term business planning and forecasting. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data. The market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. The reporting units carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt.  ##TABLE_START 26 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  During the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years, we completed our annual impairment assessments, and impairment tests when necessary, and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years. Identified Intangibles We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If it is determined that an individual asset is impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Based on our impairment reviews of our intangible assets, we recognized impairment charges of approximately $10 million in 2011 and no impairment charges in the prior two fiscal years. Income Taxes We must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity, and effectively settled issues. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Inventory The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. The estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. As of December 31, 2011, we had total work-in-process inventory of $1.7 billion and total finished goods inventory of $1.8 billion. The demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin.  ##TABLE_START 27 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  In order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory, and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Over the past 12 quarters, excess capacity charges ranged from zero to $680 million per quarter. Loss Contingencies We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and asserted and potential claims, accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments (loss contingencies) that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. The outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims, and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments, are subject to significant uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. With respect to estimating the losses associated with repairing and replacing parts in connection with product errata, we make judgments with respect to customer return rates, costs to repair or replace parts, and where the product is in our customers manufacturing process. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter, and we may revise our estimates. These revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Accounting Changes and Recent Accounting Standards For a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3: Accounting Changes and Note 4: Recent Accounting Standards in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  ##TABLE_START 28 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    2011   2010   2009  (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  Dollars   % of Net Revenue   Dollars   % of Net Revenue   Dollars   % of Net Revenue  Net revenue  $ 53,999    100.0 %  $ 43,623    100.0 %  $ 35,127    100.0 % Cost of sales   20,242    37.5 %   15,132    34.7 %   15,566    44.3 %              Gross margin   33,757    62.5 %   28,491    65.3 %   19,561    55.7 %              Research and development   8,350    15.4 %   6,576    15.1 %   5,653    16.1 % Marketing, general and administrative   7,670    14.2 %   6,309    14.5 %   7,931    22.6 % Restructuring and asset impairment charges        %        %   231    0.6 % Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles   260    0.5 %   18     %   35    0.1 %              Operating income   17,477    32.4 %   15,588    35.7 %   5,711    16.3 % Gains (losses) on equity investments, net   112    0.2 %   348    0.8 %   (170 )   (0.5 )% Interest and other, net   192    0.3 %   109    0.3 %   163    0.4 %              Income before taxes   17,781    32.9 %   16,045    36.8 %   5,704    16.2 % Provision for taxes   4,839    8.9 %   4,581    10.5 %   1,335    3.8 %              Net income  $ 12,942    24.0 %  $ 11,464    26.3 %  $ 4,369    12.4 %              Diluted earnings per common share  $ 2.39    $ 2.01    $ 0.77             ##TABLE_END Geographic Breakdown of Revenue  Our net revenue for 2011, which included 53 weeks, increased $10.4 billion, or 24%, compared to 2010, which included 52 weeks. The increase was due to significantly higher platform (microprocessor and chipset) average selling prices and, to a lesser extent, slightly higher platform unit sales. Revenue from Intel Mobile Communications (formerly the WLS business of Infineon) and McAfee contributed $3.6 billion to 2011 revenue. Revenue in the Americas, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Japan regions increased by 31%, 24%, 23%, and 13%, respectively, compared to 2010.  Our overall gross margin dollars for 2011 increased $5.3 billion, or 18%, compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue from our existing business as well as our acquired business. The increase was partially offset by approximately $1.0 billion of higher start-up costs compared to 2010. The amortization of acquisition-related intangibles resulted in a $482 million reduction to our overall gross margin dollars in 2011, compared to $65 million in 2010, primarily due to the acquisitions of McAfee and the WLS business of Infineon.  ##TABLE_START 29 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 62.5% in 2011 from 65.3% in 2010. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage decrease in the PC Client Group and, to a lesser extent, the gross margin percentage decrease in the other Intel architecture operating segments. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2011, and most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2010, from the sale of platforms in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. Our net revenue for 2010 increased $8.5 billion, or 24%, compared to 2009. The increase was due to significantly higher platform unit sales and, to a lesser extent, higher platform average selling prices. Revenue in the Japan, Asia-Pacific, Americas, and Europe regions increased by 31%, 29%, 21%, and 6%, respectively, compared to 2009. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2010 increased $8.9 billion, or 46%, compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. To a lesser extent, excess capacity charges recorded in 2009 of $1.1 billion and lower platform unit costs contributed to the increase in gross margin dollars for 2010 compared to 2009. These increases were partially offset by charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel  6 Series Express Chipset family. For further information, see Note 20: Chipset Design Issue in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our overall gross margin percentage increased to 65.3% in 2010 from 55.7% in 2009. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increase in the PC Client Group operating segment and, to a lesser extent, gross margin percentage increases in the Data Center Group, the other Intel architecture operating segments, and the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group. We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2010 and 2009 from the sale of platforms in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. PC Client Group The revenue and operating income for the PC Client Group (PCCG) for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010   2009  Net revenue  $ 35,406   $ 30,327   $ 24,894  Operating income  $ 14,793   $ 12,971   $ 7,441  ##TABLE_END Net revenue for the PCCG operating segment increased by $5.1 billion, or 17%, in 2011 compared to 2010. Platforms within PCCG include those designed for the notebook and desktop computing market segments. The increase in revenue was due to higher notebook platform unit sales and higher notebook platform average selling prices. To a lesser extent, higher desktop platform average selling prices and slightly higher desktop platform unit sales also contributed to the increase. Operating income increased by $1.8 billion in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. The increase was partially offset by approximately $960 million of higher start-up costs. Higher operating expenses, platform unit costs, and inventory write-offs compared to 2010 also contributed to the offset. For 2010, net revenue for the PCCG operating segment increased by $5.4 billion, or 22%, in 2010 compared to 2009. Significantly higher notebook platform unit sales were the primary driver for the increase in revenue. To a lesser extent, higher desktop platform unit sales and slightly higher notebook platform average selling prices also contributed to the increase. Operating income increased by $5.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. During 2009, PCCG recognized approximately $1.0 billion of excess capacity charges. Additionally, lower platform unit costs in 2010 contributed to the increase in operating income. These impacts were partially offset by charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel  6 Series Express Chipset family. Additionally, operating expenses in 2010 were higher compared to 2009.  ##TABLE_START 30 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Data Center Group The revenue and operating income for the Data Center Group (DCG) for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010   2009  Net revenue  $ 10,129   $ 8,693   $ 6,450  Operating income  $ 5,100   $ 4,388   $ 2,289  ##TABLE_END Net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased by $1.4 billion, or 17%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in revenue was due to significantly higher server platform unit sales. To a lesser extent, slightly higher server platform average selling prices also contributed to the increase. Operating income increased by $712 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses compared to 2010. For 2010, net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased by $2.2 billion, or 35%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in revenue was primarily due to significantly higher server platform unit sales. To a lesser extent, higher server platform average selling prices also contributed to the increase. Operating income increased by $2.1 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in operating income was due to significantly higher revenue and, to a lesser extent, lower platform unit costs. Other Intel Architecture Operating Segments The revenue and operating income (loss) for the other Intel architecture (Other IA) operating segments, including Intel Mobile Communications (IMC), the Intelligent Systems Group (ISG), the Netbook and Tablet Group (NTG), and the Ultra-Mobility Group (UMG), for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010   2009  Net revenue  $ 5,005   $ 3,055   $ 2,683  Operating income (loss)  $ (577 )  $ 270   $ (45 ) ##TABLE_END Net revenue for the Other IA operating segments increased by $2.0 billion, or 64%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to IMC revenue, an operating segment formed from the acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon in the first quarter of 2011. To a lesser extent, significantly higher embedded platform unit sales within ISG also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by significantly lower netbook platform unit sales within NTG. Operating results for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $847 million from an operating income of $270 million in 2010 to an operating loss of $577 million in 2011. The decline in operating results was primarily due to higher operating expenses within each of the Other IA operating segments, partially offset by higher revenue. For 2010, net revenue for the Other IA operating segments increased by $372 million, or 14%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was due to significantly higher embedded platform unit sales within ISG. Operating results for the Other IA operating segments increased by $315 million, from an operating loss of $45 million in 2009 to an operating income of $270 million in 2010. The increase in operating results was due to higher revenue and lower netbook platform unit costs within NTG. To a lesser extent, lower embedded platform unit costs within ISG also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses in NTG and ISG.  ##TABLE_START 31 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Software and Services Operating Segments The revenue and operating income (loss) for the software and services operating segments, including McAfee, the Wind River Software Group, and the Software and Services Group, for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010   2009  Net revenue  $ 1,870   $ 264   $ 115  Operating income (loss)  $ (32 )  $ (175 )  $ (100 ) ##TABLE_END Net revenue for the software and services operating segments increased by $1.6 billion in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was due to revenue from McAfee, which was acquired during the first quarter of 2011. Due to the revaluation of McAfees historic deferred revenue to fair value, we excluded $204 million of revenue that would have been reported in 2011 if McAfees deferred revenue had not been written down due to the acquisition. The operating loss for the software and services operating segments decreased by $143 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease was due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expense across each of the software and services operating segments. Due to the revaluation of McAfees historic deferred revenue to fair value at the time of acquisition, we excluded revenue and associated costs that would have increased operating results by $190 million in 2011. For 2010, net revenue for the software and services operating segments increased by $149 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue from the Wind River Software Group. We acquired Wind River Systems, Inc. during the third quarter of 2009. The operating loss for the software and services operating segments increased by $75 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in operating losses was due to higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher revenue within the Wind River Software Group. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010   2009  Research and development  $ 8,350   $ 6,576   $ 5,653  Marketing, general and administrative  $ 7,670   $ 6,309   $ 7,931  Restructuring and asset impairment charges  $    $    $ 231  Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles  $ 260   $ 18   $ 35  ##TABLE_END  Research and Development. RD spending increased by $1.8 billion, or 27%, in 2011 compared to 2010, and increased by $923 million, or 16%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the expenses of McAfee and IMC, and higher compensation expenses based on an increase in employees. In addition, lower overall process development costs due to the transition to manufacturing start-up costs related to our 22nm process technology were mostly offset by higher process development costs due to RD of our next-generation 14nm process technology. The increase in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher profit-dependent compensation, an increase in employees, and higher process development costs as we transitioned from manufacturing start-up costs related to our 32nm process technology to RD of our 22nm process technology. Marketing, General and Administrative . Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased $1.4 billion, or 22%, in 2011 compared to 2010, and decreased $1.6 billion, or 20%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the expenses of McAfee and IMC, higher compensation expenses based on an increase in employees, and higher advertising expenses (including cooperative advertising expenses). The decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the 2009 charge of $1.447 billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the European Commission (EC) and the $1.25 billion payment to AMD in 2009 as part of a settlement agreement. These decreases were partially offset by higher advertising expenses (including cooperative advertising expenses), higher profit-dependent compensation, and, to a lesser extent, expenses related to our Wind River Software Group operating segment and an expense of $100 million recognized during the fourth quarter of 2010 due to a patent cross-license agreement that we entered into with NVIDIA in January 2011 (see Note 17: Identified Intangible Assets in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). RD, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 30% of net revenue in 2011 and 2010, and 39% of net revenue in 2009.  ##TABLE_START 32 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges . The following table summarizes restructuring and asset impairment charges by plan for the three years ended December 31, 2011: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010   2009  2009 restructuring program  $    $    $ 215  2006 efficiency program           16         Total restructuring and asset impairment charges  $    $    $ 231         ##TABLE_END The 2009 restructuring included closing two assembly and test facilities in Malaysia, one facility in the Philippines, and one facility in China; stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Oregon; and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in California. The 2006 efficiency program was designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results. Both programs are complete. Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles. The increase of $242 million was primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of McAfee and the WLS business of Infineon, both completed in the first quarter of 2011. For further information, see Note 14: Acquisitions and Note 17: Identified Intangible Assets in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation totaled $1.1 billion in 2011 ($917 million in 2010 and $889 million in 2009). Share-based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses. As of December 31, 2011, unrecognized share-based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 (Dollars in Millions)  Unrecognized Share-Based Compensation Costs   Weighted Average Period  Stock options  $ 161    1.0 years  Restricted stock units  $ 1,275    1.2 years  ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2011, there was $13 million in unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire common stock under our stock purchase plan, and we expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately one and a half months. Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments and Interest and Other Gains (losses) on equity investments, net and interest and other, net for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010   2009  Gains (losses) on equity investments, net  $ 112   $ 348   $ (170 ) Interest and other, net  $ 192   $ 109   $ 163  ##TABLE_END Net gains on equity investments were lower in 2011 compared to 2010. We recognized lower gains on sales, higher equity method losses, and lower gains on third-party merger transactions in 2011 compared to 2010. We recognized a net gain on equity investments in 2010 compared to a net loss in 2009. In 2010, we recognized higher gains on sales, higher gains on third-party merger transactions, lower impairment charges, and lower equity method losses compared to 2009. Net gains on equity investments for 2011 included a gain of $150 million on the sale of shares in VMware, Inc. During 2010, we recognized a gain of $181 million on the initial public offering of SMART Technologies, Inc. and subsequent partial sale of our shares in the secondary offering. We also recognized a gain of $91 million on the sale of our ownership interest in Numonyx B.V., and a gain of $67 million on the sale of shares in Micron in 2010. Net gains (losses) on equity investments also included our proportionate share of the income or loss from Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC) ($145 million loss in 2011, $116 million loss in 2010, and $27 million loss in 2009) and Numonyx ($42 million gain in 2010 and $31 million loss in 2009). The equity method losses recognized in 2011 reduced our carrying value in Clearwire LLC to zero. We do not expect to recognize additional equity method losses for Clearwire LLC in the future. For further information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  ##TABLE_START 33 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Interest and other, net increased in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to a $164 million gain recognized upon formation of the Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC joint venture during 2011. For further information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments, in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The gain was partially offset by the recognition of $41 million of interest expense in 2011 compared to zero in 2010 and lower interest income in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of lower average investment balances. We recognized interest expense in 2011 due to the issuance of $5.0 billion aggregate principal of senior unsecured notes in the third quarter of 2011. Interest and other, net was lower in 2010 compared to 2009 on lower interest income. Interest income was lower as a result of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances. The average interest rate earned during 2010 decreased by approximately 0.5 percentage points compared to 2009. In addition, lower fair value gains on our trading assets (zero in 2010 and $70 million in 2009) were partially offset by lower exchange rate losses (zero in 2010 and $40 million in 2009). Exchange rate losses in 2009 were due to euro exposure related to our euro-denominated liability for the EC fine of $1.447 billion in 2009. For further information on the EC fine, see Note 29: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Provision for Taxes Our provision for taxes and effective tax rate were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 (Dollars in Millions)  2011   2010   2009  Income before taxes  $ 17,781   $ 16,045   $ 5,704  Provision for taxes  $ 4,839   $ 4,581   $ 1,335  Effective tax rate   27.2 %   28.6 %   23.4 % ##TABLE_END We generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2011 compared to 2010, positively impacting our effective tax rate for 2011. We generated a higher percentage of our profits from higher tax jurisdictions in 2010 compared to 2009, negatively impacting our effective tax rate for 2010. The effective tax rate for 2009 was positively impacted by the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $366 million on settlements, effective settlements, and related remeasurements of various uncertain tax positions. These impacts were partially offset by the recognition of the EC fine of $1.447 billion in 2009, which was not tax deductible and therefore significantly increased our effective tax rate for 2009. For further information on the EC fine, see Note 29: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  ##TABLE_START 34 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Liquidity and Capital Resources ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 (Dollars in Millions)  Dec. 31, 2011   Dec. 25, 2010  Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets  $ 14,837   $ 21,497  Loans receivable and other long-term investments  $ 1,769   $ 3,876  Short-term and long-term debt  $ 7,331   $ 2,115  Debt as % of stockholders equity   16.0 %   4.3 % ##TABLE_END Sources and Uses of Cash (In Millions)  ##TABLE_START 35 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  In summary, our cash flows were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010   2009  Net cash provided by operating activities  $ 20,963   $ 16,692   $ 11,170  Net cash used for investing activities   (10,301 )   (10,539 )   (7,965 ) Net cash used for financing activities   (11,100 )   (4,642 )   (2,568 ) Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents   5                 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents  $ (433 )  $ 1,511   $ 637         ##TABLE_END  Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. For 2011 compared to 2010, the $4.3 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to adjustments for non-cash items and higher net income. The adjustments for non-cash items were higher for 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization of intangibles, as well as increases in non-acquisition-related deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2011 compared to December 25, 2010. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2011 compared to 2010 were $1.3 billion lower, largely due to the tax benefit of depreciating 100% of assets placed in service in the United States in 2011. Changes in assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2011 compared to December 25, 2010 included the following: ##TABLE_START   Income taxes payable increased and income taxes receivable decreased due to timing of payments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Accounts payable increased due to business growth as well as an increase in capital spending. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Accounts receivable increased due to higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. ##TABLE_END For 2011, our two largest customers accounted for 34% of our net revenue (38% in 2010 and 2009), with one of these customers accounting for 19% of our net revenue (21% in 2010 and 2009), and another customer accounting for 15% of our net revenue (17% in 2010 and 2009). These two largest customers accounted for 32% of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2011 (44% as of December 25, 2010). For 2010 compared to 2009, the $5.5 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to higher net income, partially offset by adjustments for non-cash items. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2010 compared to 2009 were $3.7 billion higher, primarily due to higher income before taxes in 2010. Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals, as well as cash used for acquisitions. Cash used for investing activities decreased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010. A decrease due to net maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments in 2011, as compared to net purchases of available-for-sale investments in 2010, was offset by higher cash paid for acquisitions, of which the substantial majority was for our acquisition of McAfee in the first quarter of 2011, and an increase in capital expenditures as we build and equip our 22nm process technology manufacturing capacity. Our capital expenditures were $10.8 billion in 2011 ($5.2 billion in 2010 and $4.5 billion in 2009) due to expanding our network of fabrication facilities to include an additional large-scale fabrication facility as well as bringing our 22nm process technology manufacturing capacity online in 2011. The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of available-for-sale investments and, to a lesser extent, higher capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net purchases of trading assets and lower cash paid for acquisitions.  ##TABLE_START 36 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans. The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, partially offset by the issuance of long-term debt in 2011 and higher proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans. We have an ongoing authorization, since October 2005, as amended, from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $45 billion in shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. This amount includes $20 billion of increases in the authorization limit approved by our Board of Directors in 2011. During 2011, we repurchased $14.1 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program compared to $1.5 billion in 2010. As of December 31, 2011, $10.1 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled $2.0 billion in 2011 compared to $587 million in 2010. Our total dividend payments were $4.1 billion in 2011 compared to $3.5 billion in 2010 as a result of increases in quarterly cash dividends per common share. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 77 quarters. In January 2012, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per common share for the first quarter of 2012. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2012 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2012. The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2009. Liquidity Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. We maintain a diverse portfolio that we continuously analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. As of December 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets totaled $14.8 billion ($21.5 billion as of December 25, 2010). In addition to the $14.8 billion, we have $1.8 billion in loans receivable and other long-term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with A/A2 or better rated issuers, and a majority of the issuers are rated AA-/Aa3 or better. As certain countries in Europe are experiencing economic uncertainty, we continue to monitor the credit quality of our European sovereign and non-sovereign debt investments. The credit quality of our investment portfolio within the European region remains high, with substantially all of our sovereign debt investments with AA-/Aa3 or better rated issuers, and most of the non-sovereign debt issuers rated A/A2 or better. As of December 31, 2011, our total investments located in Spain, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal were approximately $50 million, all of which matures in 2012. We have $1 million in unrealized losses related to these investments. These countries have experienced significant economic uncertainty and credit downgrades, so we will only make investments in these countries in the future if their risk profile meets our investment objectives. Our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2011 were $1.4 billion, and $200 million of commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard  Poors and P-1 by Moodys as of December 31, 2011. We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. In the third quarter of 2011, we utilized this shelf registration statement and issued $5.0 billion aggregate principal of senior unsecured notes. These notes were issued primarily to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and for general corporate purposes. For further information on the terms of the notes, see Note 21: Borrowings in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions or strategic investments.  ##TABLE_START 37 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Fair Value of Financial Instruments When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. For further information, see Fair Value in Note 2: Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value. When fair value is determined using pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, the issuers credit risk or Intels credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value, as appropriate. Marketable Debt Instruments As of December 31, 2011, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $15.1 billion of marketable debt instruments. Of these instruments, $6.1 billion was classified as Level 1, $8.7 billion as Level 2, and $218 million as Level 3. Our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. Management judgment was required to determine the levels for the frequency of transactions that should be met for a market to be considered active. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration the number of days each individual instrument trades over a specified period. Of the $8.7 billion balance of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2, approximately 60% of the balance was classified as Level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model and approximately 40% due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data. Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. When observable market data is not available, we corroborate our fair value measurements using non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes from a second source. Loans Receivable As of December 31, 2011, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $748 million of loans receivable. All of these securities were classified as Level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Marketable Equity Securities As of December 31, 2011, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $562 million of marketable equity securities. Most of these securities were classified as Level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period.  ##TABLE_START 38 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    Payments Due by Period  (In Millions)  Total   Less Than 1 Year   13 Years   35 Years   More Than 5 Years  Operating lease obligations  $ 707   $ 183   $ 254   $ 134   $ 136  Capital purchase obligations 1    4,652    4,605    47          Other purchase obligations and commitments 2    1,001    633    309    55    4  Long-term debt obligations 3    14,822    292    572    2,072    11,886  Other long-term liabilities 4, 5   1,954    609    702    534    109             Total 6   $ 23,136   $ 6,322   $ 1,884   $ 2,795   $ 12,135             ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1  Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011, as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 2  Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include, for example, agreements to fund various projects with other companies. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 3  Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 4  We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $165 million of long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the preceding table. However, long-term income taxes payable, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non-U.S. income taxes. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 5  Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Expected required contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $65 million to be made during 2012 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2012 are not practical to estimate. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 6  Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. ##TABLE_END  Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements are not included in the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the preceding table. These obligations include milestone-based co-marketing agreements, contingent funding/payment obligations, and milestone-based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party.  ##TABLE_START 39 ##TABLE_END MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is not included in the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest. Contractual obligations with regard to our investment in IMFT/IMFS are not included in the preceding table. We are currently committed to purchasing 49% of IMFTs and 22% of IMFSs production output and production-related services. We also have several agreements with Micron related to IP, and RD funding related to non-volatile memory manufacturing. The obligation to purchase our proportion of IMFT/IMFSs inventory was approximately $125 million as of December 31, 2011. For further information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2011, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.  ##TABLE_START 40 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange Rates In general, we economically hedge currency risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases is incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, the euro, the Israeli shekel, and the Chinese yuan. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. For further information, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $40 million as of December 31, 2011 (less than $35 million as of December 25, 2010). Interest Rates We generally hedge interest rate risks of fixed-rate debt instruments with interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to interest rate loss. We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and indebtedness. Our indebtedness includes our debt issuances and the liability associated with a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA. For further information, see Note 17: Identified Intangible Assets in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately $900 million as of December 31, 2011 (an increase of approximately $250 million as of December 25, 2010). The significant increase from December 25, 2010 is primarily driven by the inclusion of the $5.0 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in the third quarter of 2011. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 1.0%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $20 million as of December 31, 2011 (an increase of approximately $15 million as of December 25, 2010). The fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in the fair value of our net investment position. For further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, see Note 5: Fair Value in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Equity Prices Our marketable equity investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options. To the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities; however, for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments, we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks. For securities that we no longer consider strategic, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk. We hold derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. The gains and losses from changes in fair value of these derivatives are designed to offset the gains and losses on the related liabilities, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss.  ##TABLE_START 41 ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $585 million ($1.5 billion as of December 25, 2010). Our marketable equity investment in Imagination Technologies Group PLC was carried at a total fair market value of $327 million, or 56% of our marketable equity portfolio, as of December 31, 2011. Our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed necessary. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we analyzed the expected market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a loss of 45% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $265 million, based on the value as of December 31, 2011 (a decrease in value of approximately $365 million, based on the value as of December 25, 2010 using an assumed loss of 40%). Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity investments, excluding investments accounted for under the equity method, had a carrying amount of $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2011 ($872 million as of December 25, 2010). As of December 31, 2011, the carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $1.6 billion ($1.8 billion as of December 25, 2010). Approximately half of the total non-marketable equity investments balance as of December 31, 2011 was concentrated in our IMFT/IMFS investment of $1.3 billion ($1.5 billion as of December 25, 2010).  ##TABLE_START 42 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Note 1: Basis of Presentation We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal year 2011 was a 53-week year. Fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were 52-week years. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Intel Corporation and our wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. We use the equity method to account for equity investments in instances in which we own common stock or similar interests and have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. In the first quarter of 2011, we completed the acquisition of McAfee, Inc. For further information, see Note 14: Acquisitions. Certain of the operations acquired from McAfee have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, translation adjustments have been recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) beginning in 2011. Prior to the acquisition of McAfee, the U.S. dollar was the functional currency for Intel and all of our subsidiaries; therefore, we do not have a translation adjustment recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for fiscal years 2010 and 2009. Note 2: Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The accounting estimates that require our most significant, difficult, and subjective judgments include: ##TABLE_START   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment; goodwill; and identified intangibles); ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions); ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the valuation of inventory; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies. ##TABLE_END The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. Fair Value Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets and liabilities are measured and recorded at fair value, except for equity method investments, cost method investments, cost method loans receivable, and most of our liabilities. Fair Value Hierarchy The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data. For further discussion of fair value, see Note 5: Fair Value and Note 22: Retirement Benefit Plans.  ##TABLE_START 48 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Trading Assets Marketable debt instruments are generally designated as trading assets when the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument or when the marketable debt instrument is used to economically hedge foreign exchange rate risk from the remeasurement of intercompany loans. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. The gains or losses of these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and intercompany loans, are recorded in interest and other, net. We also designate certain floating-rate securitized financial instruments, primarily asset-backed securities, as trading assets. Available-for-Sale Investments We consider all liquid available-for-sale debt instruments with original maturities from the date of purchase of approximately three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Available-for-sale debt instruments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Available-for-sale debt instruments with remaining maturities beyond one year are classified as other long-term investments. Investments that we designate as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except as noted in the Other-Than-Temporary Impairment section below. We determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level. Our available-for-sale investments include: ##TABLE_START   Marketable debt instruments when the interest rate and foreign currency risks are not hedged at inception of the investment or when our criteria for designation as trading assets are not met. We generally hold these debt instruments to generate a return commensurate with the U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR. We record the interest income and realized gains and losses on the sale of these instruments in interest and other, net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   Marketable equity securities when there are barriers to mitigating equity market risk through the sale or use of derivative instruments at the time of original classification and there is no plan to sell the investment at the time of original classification. We acquire these equity investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. To the extent that these investments continue to have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks through hedging activities. We record the realized gains or losses on the sale or exchange of marketable equity securities in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END Non-Marketable and Other Equity Investments Our non-marketable equity and other equity investments are included in other long-term assets. We account for non-marketable equity and other equity investments for which we do not have control over the investee as: ##TABLE_START   Equity method investments when we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Our proportionate share of the income or loss is recognized on a one-quarter lag and is recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Equity method investments include marketable and non-marketable investments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Non-marketable cost method investments when the equity method does not apply. We record the realized gains or losses on the sale of non-marketable cost method investments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 49 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Our available-for-sale investments and non-marketable and other equity investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. Investments are considered impaired when the fair value is below the investments adjusted cost basis. Impairments affect earnings as follows: ##TABLE_START   Marketable debt instruments when the fair value is below amortized cost and we intend to sell the instrument, it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument (that is, a credit loss exists). When we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument, other-than-temporary impairments are separated into amounts representing credit losses, which are recognized in interest and other, net, and amounts related to all other factors, which are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Marketable equity securities based on the specific facts and circumstances present at the time of assessment, which include the consideration of general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is below cost, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in value in the foreseeable future. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee, which may include industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and changes in the investees credit rating. We record other-than-temporary impairment charges on marketable equity securities and marketable equity method investments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Non-marketable equity investments based on our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment, and qualitative and quantitative analysis, including: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the investees revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the technological feasibility of the investees products and technologies; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    factors related to the investees ability to remain in business, such as the investees liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. ##TABLE_ENDWe record other-than-temporary impairment charges for non-marketable cost method investments and equity method investments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Derivative Financial Instruments Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk and commodity price risk. Our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. Our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for designation as a cash flow hedge. A designated hedge of the exposure to variability in the future foreign currency equivalent cash flows of a forecasted transaction is referred to as a cash flow hedge. The criteria for designating a derivative as a cash flow hedge include the assessment of the instruments effectiveness in risk reduction, matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction, and the assessment of the probability that the underlying transaction will occur. For derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction. Derivatives that we designate as cash flow hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from operating activities. We recognize gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes in the line item on the consolidated statements of income most closely associated with the related exposures, primarily in interest and other, net and gains (losses) on equity investments, net. As part of our strategic investment program, we also acquire equity derivative instruments, such as equity conversion rights associated with debt instruments, that we do not designate as hedging instruments. We recognize the gains or losses from changes in fair values of these equity derivative instruments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Gains and losses from derivatives not designated as hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within cash flows from operating activities.  ##TABLE_START 50 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Measurement of Effectiveness ##TABLE_START   Effectiveness for forwards is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the fair value of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item. For currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to capital purchases, forward points are excluded, and effectiveness is measured using spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item. For currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to operating expenditures, forward points are included and effectiveness is measured using forward rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Effectiveness for options is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of an option instrument representing the hedged risks in the hedged item. Time value is excluded and effectiveness is measured using spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Effectiveness for interest rate swaps and commodity swaps is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the swap with the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item. ##TABLE_END If a cash flow hedge is discontinued because it is no longer probable that the original hedged transaction will occur as previously anticipated, the cumulative unrealized gain or loss on the related derivative is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. Subsequent gains or losses on the related derivative instrument are recognized in interest and other, net in each period until the instrument matures, is terminated, is re-designated as a qualified cash flow hedge, or is sold. Ineffective portions of cash flow hedges, as well as amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, are recognized in earnings in interest and other, net. For further discussion of our derivative instruments and risk management programs, see Note 8: Derivative Financial Instruments. Securities Lending We may enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions, generally to facilitate hedging and certain investment transactions. Selected securities may be loaned, secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investment assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and cash equivalent collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. For lending agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the collateral as an asset or a liability, unless the collateral is repledged. Loans Receivable We make loans to third parties that are classified within other current assets or other long-term assets. We may elect the fair value option for loans when the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. We record the gains or losses on these loans arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate, currency, and counterparty credit changes, mostly offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments, in interest and other, net. Loans that are denominated in U.S. dollars and have a floating-rate coupon are carried at amortized cost. We measure interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method, which is based on the effective yield of the loans rather than the stated coupon rate. For further discussion of our loans receivable, see Note 5: Fair Value. Inventories We compute inventory cost on a currently adjusted standard basis (which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis). Inventories at year-ends were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010  Raw materials  $ 644   $ 471  Work in process   1,680    1,887  Finished goods   1,772    1,399       Total inventories  $ 4,096   $ 3,757       ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START 51 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, net at year-ends was as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010  Land and buildings  $ 17,883   $ 17,421  Machinery and equipment   34,351    30,421  Construction in progress   5,839    2,639       Total property, plant and equipment, gross   58,073    50,481  Less: accumulated depreciation   (34,446 )   (32,582 )      Total property, plant and equipment, net  $ 23,627   $ 17,899       ##TABLE_END We compute depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method. Substantially all of our depreciable property, plant and equipment assets are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment, 2 to 4 years; buildings, 4 to 25 years. We capitalize a substantial majority of interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment. Goodwill We record goodwill when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets as of the date of acquisition, assigning the goodwill to our applicable reporting units based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition. We perform a quarterly review of goodwill for indicators of impairment. During the fourth quarter of each year, we perform an impairment assessment for each reporting unit, and impairment tests using a fair value approach when necessary. The reporting units carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. For further discussion of goodwill, see Note 16: Goodwill. Identified Intangible Assets Licensed technology assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods of benefit. We amortize all acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over the estimated useful life based on economic benefit. Acquisition-related in-process research and development assets represent the fair value of incomplete research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition and are initially classified as other intangible assets that are not subject to amortization. Assets related to projects that have been completed are transferred from other intangible assets to acquisition-related developed technology, and are subject to amortization, while assets related to projects that have been abandoned are impaired. In the quarter following the period in which identified intangible assets become fully amortized, the fully amortized balances are removed from the gross asset and accumulated amortization amounts. The estimated useful life ranges for identified intangible assets that are subject to amortization as of December 31, 2011 are as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000    Estimated Useful Life (In Years)  Acquisition-related developed technology   39  Acquisition-related customer relationships   28  Acquisition-related trade names   57  Licensed technology   517  ##TABLE_END We perform a quarterly review of identified intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess recoverability by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. For further discussion of identified intangible assets, see Note 17: Identified Intangible Assets.  ##TABLE_START 52 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Product Warranty The vast majority of our products are sold with a limited warranty on product quality and a limited indemnification for customers against intellectual property rights (IP) infringement claims related to our products. The accrual and the related expense for known product warranty issues were not significant during the periods presented. Due to product testing, the short time typically between product shipment and the detection and correction of product failures, and the historical rate of payments on indemnification claims, the accrual and related expense for estimated incurred but unidentified issues were not significant during the periods presented. Revenue Recognition We recognize net product revenue when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, transfer of title, and acceptance, if applicable, as well as fixed pricing and probable collectibility. We record pricing allowances, including discounts based on contractual arrangements with customers, when we recognize revenue as a reduction to both accounts receivable and net revenue. Because of frequent sales price reductions and rapid technology obsolescence in the industry, we defer product revenue and related costs of sales from sales made to distributors under agreements allowing price protection or right of return until the distributors sell the merchandise. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. We record the net deferred income from product sales to distributors on our balance sheet as deferred income on shipments to distributors. We include shipping charges billed to customers in net revenue, and include the related shipping costs in cost of sales. Revenue from license agreements with our McAfee business generally includes service and support agreements for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period. Revenue derived from online subscription products is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period. Professional services revenue is recognized as services are performed or, if required, upon customer acceptance. For arrangements with multiple elements, including software licenses, maintenance, and/or services, revenue is allocated across the separately identified deliverables and may be recognized or deferred. When vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) does not exist for undelivered elements such as maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Direct costs, such as costs related to revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements associated with license arrangements, as well as component costs associated with product revenue, are deferred and amortized over the same period that the related revenue is recognized. Sales of software through our Wind River Software Group are made through term licenses that are generally 12 months in length, or perpetual licenses. Revenue is generally deferred and recognized ratably over the course of the license. Advertising Cooperative advertising programs reimburse customers for marketing activities for certain of our products, subject to defined criteria. We accrue cooperative advertising obligations and record the costs at the same time that the related revenue is recognized. We record cooperative advertising costs as marketing, general and administrative expenses to the extent that an advertising benefit separate from the revenue transaction can be identified and the fair value of that advertising benefit received is determinable. We record any excess in cash paid over the fair value of the advertising benefit received as a reduction in revenue. Advertising costs, including direct marketing costs, recorded within marketing, general and administrative expenses were $2.1 billion in 2011 ($1.8 billion in 2010 and $1.4 billion in 2009). Employee Equity Incentive Plans We have employee equity incentive plans, which are described more fully in Note 24: Employee Equity Incentive Plans. We use the straight-line attribution method to recognize share-based compensation over the service period of the award. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock units, we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and restricted stock units with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award.  ##TABLE_START 53 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Note 3: Accounting Changes In the first quarter of 2011, we adopted new standards for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. These new standards change the determination of whether the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units for accounting purposes. Additionally, these new standards modify the method by which revenue is allocated to the separately identified deliverables. The adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the first quarter of 2011, we adopted new standards that remove certain tangible products and associated software from the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. The adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we adopted amended standards that simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment. These amended standards permit an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value. For reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, these amended standards eliminate the requirement to perform goodwill impairment testing. The adoption of these amended standards did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the first quarter of 2010, we adopted new standards for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity. These new standards eliminated a mandatory quantitative approach in favor of a qualitative analysis, and require an ongoing reassessment. The adoption of these new standards did not impact our consolidated statements of income or balance sheets. Note 4: Recent Accounting Standards In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amended standards to achieve a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards. For assets and liabilities categorized as Level 3 and recognized at fair value, these amended standards require disclosure of quantitative information about unobservable inputs, a description of the valuation processes used by the entity, and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements. In addition, these amended standards require that we disclose the level in the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments disclosed at fair value but not recorded at fair value. These new standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2012; early adoption of these standards is prohibited. We do not expect these new standards to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. In 2011, the FASB issued amended standards to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. These amendments eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and require that all changes in stockholders equityexcept investments by, and distributions to, ownersbe presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. These new standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2012 and are to be applied retrospectively. These amended standards will impact the presentation of other comprehensive income but will not impact our financial position or results of operations.  ##TABLE_START 54 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Note 5: Fair Value Assets/Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following types of instruments as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    December 31, 2011   December 25, 2010     Fair Value Measured and Recorded at Reporting Date Using   Total   Fair Value Measured and Recorded at Reporting Date Using   Total  (In Millions)  Level 1   Level 2   Level 3    Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Assets         Cash equivalents:         Commercial paper  $    $ 2,408   $    $ 2,408   $    $ 2,600   $    $ 2,600  Government bonds   650            650    1,279    505        1,784  Bank deposits       795        795        560        560  Money market fund deposits   546            546    34            34  Short-term investments:         Government bonds   2,690    310        3,000    4,890    1,320        6,210  Commercial paper       1,409        1,409        2,712        2,712  Corporate bonds   120    428    28    576    121    1,378    1    1,500  Bank deposits       196        196        858        858  Asset-backed securities                           14    14  Trading assets:         Government bonds   1,698    1,317        3,015    311    2,115        2,426  Corporate bonds   202    486        688    199    916        1,115  Commercial paper       305        305        488        488  Municipal bonds       284        284        375        375  Bank deposits       135        135        108        108  Asset-backed securities           115    115            190    190  Money market fund deposits   49            49    3            3  Marketable equity securities                   388            388  Other current assets:         Derivative assets       159    7    166        330        330  Loans receivable       33        33                  Marketable equity securities   522    40        562    785    223        1,008  Other long-term investments:         Government bonds   177    300        477    83    2,002        2,085  Corporate bonds       282    39    321    104    601    50    755  Bank deposits       55        55        133        133  Asset-backed securities           36    36            53    53  Other long-term assets:         Loans receivable       715        715        642        642  Derivative assets       34    29    63        19    31    50                   Total assets measured and recorded at fair value  $ 6,654   $ 9,691   $ 254   $ 16,599   $ 8,197   $ 17,885   $ 339   $ 26,421                   Liabilities         Other accrued liabilities:         Derivative liabilities  $    $ 280   $ 8   $ 288   $    $ 201   $ 7   $ 208  Long-term debt           131    131            128    128  Other long-term liabilities:         Derivative liabilities       27        27        47        47                   Total liabilities measured and recorded at fair value  $    $ 307   $ 139   $ 446   $    $ 248   $ 135   $ 383                   ##TABLE_END Government bonds include bonds issued or deemed to be guaranteed by government entities.

When we use observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets, we classify our marketable debt instruments as Level 2. When observable market prices for identical securities are not available, we price our marketable debt instruments using non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data; quoted market prices for similar instruments; or pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers. These valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding and binding broker quotes; observable market prices for identical or similar securities; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and, to a lesser degree, unobservable market inputs. We corroborate non-binding market consensus prices with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exists. The discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs, such as LIBOR-based yield curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings. Our marketable debt instruments that are classified as Level 3 are classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. When observable market data is not available, we corroborate our fair value measurements using non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes from a second source. The following tables present reconciliations for all assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for 2011 and 2010: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    Fair Value Measured and Recorded Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)     (In Millions)  Corporate Bonds   Asset- Backed Securities   Derivative Assets   Derivative Liabilities   Long-Term Debt   Total Gains (Losses)  Balance as of December 25, 2010  $ 51   $ 257   $ 31   $ (7 )  $ (128 )  Total gains or losses (realized and unrealized):       Included in earnings   (3 )   (6 )   2    (1 )   (3 )   (11 ) Included in other comprehensive income (loss)   7    (2 )               5  Purchases   24    13    6           Sales       (11 )              Settlements and maturities   (12 )   (100 )              Transfers out of Level 3           (3 )                      Balance as of December 31, 2011  $ 67   $ 151   $ 36   $ (8 )  $ (131 )              Changes in unrealized gains or losses included in earnings related to assets and liabilities still held as of December 31, 2011  $ (2 )  $ (2 )  $ 2   $ (1 )  $ (3 )  $ (6 ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    Fair Value Measured and Recorded Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)     (In Millions)  Corporate Bonds   Asset- Backed Securities   Derivative Assets   Derivative Liabilities   Long-Term Debt   Total Gains (Losses)  Balance as of December 26, 2009  $ 369   $ 754   $ 31   $ (65 )  $ (123 )  Total gains or losses (realized and unrealized):       Included in earnings   (2 )   6    (3 )   (2 )   (5 )   (6 ) Included in other comprehensive income (loss)   4    9                13  Purchases   6        7           Sales   (44 )   (28 )   (4 )          Settlements and maturities   (75 )   (484 )              Transfers out of Level 3   (207 )           60                   Balance as of December 25, 2010  $ 51   $ 257   $ 31   $ (7 )  $ (128 )              Changes in unrealized gains or losses included in earnings related to assets and liabilities still held as of December 25, 2010  $    $ 6   $ (4 )  $ (1 )  $ (5 )  $ (4 ) ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START 56 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  For all periods presented, gains and losses (realized and unrealized) included in earnings were primarily reported outside of operating income. During 2010, we transferred corporate bonds from Level 3 to Level 2 due to improved availability of observable market data and non-binding market consensus prices to value or corroborate the value of these instruments. Our policy is to reflect transfers in and transfers out at the beginning of the quarter in which a change in circumstances resulted in the transfer. Fair Value Option for Financial Assets/Liabilities We elected the fair value option for loans made to third parties when the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk was hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of our loans receivable for which we elected the fair value option did not significantly differ from the contractual principal balance based on the contractual currency. These loans receivable are classified within other current assets and other long-term assets. Fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Gains and losses from changes in fair value on the loans receivable and related derivative instruments, as well as interest income, are recorded in interest and other, net. For all years presented, changes in the fair value of our loans receivable were largely offset by changes in the related derivative instruments, resulting in an insignificant net impact on our consolidated statements of income. Gains and losses attributable to changes in credit risk are determined using observable credit default spreads for the issuer or comparable companies and were insignificant for all years presented. We did not elect the fair value option for loans when the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk was not hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. We elected this fair value option for the bonds issued in 2007 by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona (2007 Arizona bonds). In connection with the 2007 Arizona bonds, we entered into a total return swap agreement that effectively converts the fixed-rate obligation on the bonds to a floating U.S.-dollar LIBOR-based rate. As a result, changes in the fair value of this debt are largely offset by changes in the fair value of the total return swap agreement, without the need to apply hedge accounting provisions. The 2007 Arizona bonds are included in long-term debt. As of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, no other instruments were similar to the 2007 Arizona bonds for which we elected fair value treatment. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of the 2007 Arizona bonds did not significantly differ from the contractual principal balance. The fair value of the 2007 Arizona bonds was determined using inputs that are observable in the market or that can be derived from or corroborated with observable market data, as well as unobservable inputs that were significant to the fair value. Gains and losses on the 2007 Arizona bonds and the related total return swap are recorded in interest and other, net. We capitalize a portion of the interest associated with the 2007 Arizona bonds. We add capitalized interest to the cost of qualified assets and amortize it over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The remaining interest associated with the 2007 Arizona bonds is recorded as interest expense in interest and other, net. Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis Our non-marketable equity investments and non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. During 2011, we recognized $62 million of impairment charges on non-marketable equity investments held as of December 31, 2011 ($121 million of impairment charges during 2010 for non-marketable equity investments held as of December 25, 2010 and $187 million of impairment charges during 2009 for non-marketable equity investments held as of December 26, 2009). The fair value of the non-marketable equity investments at the time of impairment was $69 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 ($128 million during the year ended December 25, 2010 and $211 million during the year ended December 26, 2009). All of these assets were categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. A portion of our non-marketable equity investments was measured and recorded at fair value due to events or circumstances that significantly impacted the fair value of those investments, resulting in other-than-temporary impairment charges. We classified these measurements as Level 3, as we used unobservable inputs to the valuation methodologies that were significant to the fair value measurements, and the valuations required management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies sizes, growth rates, industries, development stages, and other relevant factors. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which requires the following significant estimates for the investee: revenue, costs, and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenues and costs are developed using available market, historical, and forecast data. The valuation of these non-marketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, the investees capital structure, the terms of the investees issued interests, and the lack of marketability of the investments.  ##TABLE_START 57 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis We measure the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments, marketable equity method investments, indebtedness carried at amortized cost, and cost method loans receivable quarterly for disclosure purposes; however, the assets are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. The carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    2011   2010  (In Millions)  Carrying Amount   Fair Value   Carrying Amount   Fair Value  Non-marketable equity investments  $ 2,759   $ 6,161   $ 2,633   $ 5,144  Marketable equity method investments  $ 39   $ 67   $ 31   $ 167  Loans receivable  $ 132   $ 132   $ 208   $ 208  Long-term debt  $ 6,953   $ 7,735   $ 1,949   $ 2,283  Short-term debt  $ 200   $ 200   $    $   NVIDIA Corporation cross-license agreement liability  $ 1,156   $ 1,174   $    $   ##TABLE_END  As of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, the unrealized loss position of our non-marketable equity investments was not significant. Our marketable equity method investments are primarily made up of our ownership interest in SMART Technologies, Inc. The fair value of our ownership interest in our marketable equity method investments was based on the quoted closing stock prices as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010. The carrying amount and fair value of loans receivable exclude loans measured and recorded at a fair value of $748 million as of December 31, 2011 ($642 million as of December 25, 2010). The carrying amount and fair value of long-term debt exclude long-term debt measured and recorded at a fair value of $131 million as of December 31, 2011 ($128 million as of December 25, 2010). Short-term debt includes our commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2011, and the carrying amount and fair value exclude drafts payable. The fair value of our loans receivable is determined using a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. The credit quality of our loans receivable remains high, with credit ratings of BBB+/Baa1 or better as of December 31, 2011. The fair value of our long-term debt is determined using third-party market prices and discounted cash flow models that take into consideration variables such as credit-rating changes and interest rate changes. The NVIDIA Corporation cross-license agreement liability in the preceding table was incurred as a result of entering into a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA in January 2011. We agreed to make payments to NVIDIA over six years. For further information on the payment terms and recognition of licensed technology intangible assets, see Note 17: Identified Intangible Assets. As of December 31, 2011, the carrying amount of the liability arising from the agreement was classified within other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, as applicable. The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Note 6: Trading Assets Trading assets outstanding as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010  Marketable debt instruments  $ 4,591   $ 4,705  Marketable equity securities       388       Total trading assets  $ 4,591   $ 5,093       ##TABLE_END Net losses on marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets still held at the reporting date were $71 million in 2011 (net losses of $50 million in 2010 and net gains of $91 million in 2009). Net gains on the related derivatives and intercompany loans were $58 million in 2011 (net gains of $43 million and $18 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively). Net losses on marketable equity securities classified as trading assets still held at the reporting date, excluding the impacts of the related derivatives, were $14 million in 2010. In 2010, we sold our ownership in Numonyx B.V. to Micron Technology, Inc. The Micron common stock that we received in the transaction was classified as marketable equity securities within trading assets. During the second quarter of 2011, we sold our remaining shares in Micron.  ##TABLE_START 58 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Note 7: Available-for-Sale Investments Available-for-sale investments as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    2011   2010  (In Millions)  Adjusted Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Adjusted Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value  Government bonds  $ 4,131   $    $ (4 )  $ 4,127   $ 10,075   $ 9   $ (5 )  $ 10,079  Commercial paper   3,820        (3 )   3,817    5,312            5,312  Bank deposits   1,046    1    (1 )   1,046    1,550    1        1,551  Corporate bonds   892    14    (9 )   897    2,250    9    (4 )   2,255  Marketable equity securities   189    385    (12 )   562    380    629    (1 )   1,008  Money market fund deposits   546            546    34            34  Asset-backed securities   48        (12 )   36    76        (9 )   67                   Total available-for-sale investments  $ 10,672   $ 400   $ (41 )  $ 11,031   $ 19,677   $ 648   $ (19 )  $ 20,306                   ##TABLE_END  In the preceding table, government bonds include bonds issued or deemed to be guaranteed by government entities. Government bonds include instruments such as U.S. Treasury securities, non-U.S. government bonds, and U.S. agency securities as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010. Bank deposits were primarily issued by institutions outside the U.S. as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010. The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale debt investments as of December 31, 2011, by contractual maturity, were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  Cost   Fair Value  Due in 1 year or less  $ 9,033   $ 9,034  Due in 12 years   626    626  Due in 25 years   226    224  Due after 5 years   4    3  Instruments not due at a single maturity date   594    582       Total  $ 10,483   $ 10,469       ##TABLE_END Instruments not due at a single maturity date in the preceding table include asset-backed securities and money market fund deposits. We sold available-for-sale investments for proceeds of $9.1 billion in 2011 ($475 million in 2010 and $192 million in 2009). Substantially all of the proceeds in 2011 were from debt investments that were primarily used to fund our acquisition of McAfee. The gross realized gains on sales of available-for-sale investments were $268 million in 2011 ($160 million in 2010 and $43 million in 2009) and were primarily related to our sales of marketable equity securities. Gains on third-party merger transactions during 2011 were insignificant (insignificant in 2010 and $56 million in 2009). Impairment charges recognized on available-for-sale investments were $73 million in 2011 (insignificant in 2010 and 2009). Gross realized losses recognized on available-for-sale investments were insignificant in 2011 ($13 million in 2010 and $64 million in 2009). We had previously recognized other-than-temporary impairments totaling $34 million during 2008 and 2009 on the investments that were sold in 2009. Note 8: Derivative Financial Instruments Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk and commodity price risk. We currently do not hold derivative instruments for the purpose of managing credit risk since we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty and generally enter into derivative transactions with high-credit-quality counterparties.  ##TABLE_START 59 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to currency exchange rate risk and generally hedge our exposures with currency forward contracts, currency interest rate swaps, or currency options. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, the euro, the Israeli shekel, and the Chinese yuan. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. Our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable are generally hedged with offsetting currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. These programs reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. Our currency risk management programs include: ##TABLE_START   Currency derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize currency forward contracts and currency options to hedge exposures to the variability in the U.S.-dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S.-dollar-denominated cash flows. These instruments generally mature within 12 months. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Currency derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities, non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets, and hedges of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated loans receivable recognized at fair value. The majority of these instruments mature within 12 months. Changes in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of the underlying assets and liabilities are approximately offset by the changes in fair values of the related derivatives. We record net gains or losses in the line item on the consolidated statements of income most closely associated with the related exposures, primarily in interest and other, net, except for equity-related gains or losses, which we primarily record in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_ENDInterest Rate Risk Our primary objective for holding investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields. We generally swap the returns on our investments in fixed-rate debt instruments with remaining maturities longer than six months into U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns, unless management specifically approves otherwise. These swaps are settled at various interest payment times involving cash payments at each interest and principal payment date, with the majority of the contracts having quarterly payments. Our interest rate risk management programs include: ##TABLE_START   Interest rate derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest characteristics of debt instruments. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Interest rate derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize interest rate swaps and currency interest rate swaps in economic hedging transactions, including hedges of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets and hedges of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated loans receivable recognized at fair value. Floating interest rates on the swaps are reset on a quarterly basis. Changes in fair value of the debt instruments classified as trading assets and hedges of loans receivable recognized at fair value are generally offset by changes in fair value of the related derivatives, both of which are recorded in interest and other, net. ##TABLE_END Equity Market Risk Our marketable investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. To the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities. We may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments. For securities that we no longer consider strategic, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk. Our equity market risk management program includes equity derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives. We recognize changes in the fair value of such derivatives in gains (losses) on equity investments, net.  ##TABLE_START 60 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)   We also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains and losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the gains and losses on the related liabilities, which are both recorded in cost of sales and operating expenses. The deferred compensation liabilities were $700 million as of December 31, 2011 ($646 million as of December 25, 2010) and are included in other accrued liabilities. In 2010, we sold our ownership interest in Numonyx to Micron for consideration consisting of shares of Micron. We also entered into equity option transactions that economically hedged a portion of the ownership interest in Micron that we acquired. In the second quarter of 2011, we sold our remaining ownership interest in Micron and the related equity options matured. Commodity Price Risk We operate facilities that consume commodities and have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices, such as those for natural gas. These programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of commodity price movements. Our commodity price risk management program includes commodity derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize commodity swap contracts to hedge future cash flow exposures to the variability in commodity prices. These instruments generally mature within 12 months. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain (loss) from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction.

We estimate that we will reclassify approximately $53 million (before taxes) of net derivative losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings within the next 12 months. For all periods presented, there was an insignificant impact on results of operations from discontinued cash flow hedges as a result of forecasted transactions that were not probable to occur.  ##TABLE_START 62 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The effects of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of income for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  Location of Gains (Losses) Recognized in Income on Derivatives  2011   2010   2009  Currency forwards  Interest and other, net  $ 58   $ 72   $ 37  Interest rate swaps  Interest and other, net   (26 )   (59 )   15  Currency interest rate swaps  Interest and other, net   (17 )   74    (7 ) Total return swaps  Various   (13 )   70    51  Other  Interest and other, net       (1 )   2  Equity options  Gains (losses) on equity investments, net   (67 )   59    5  Other  Gains (losses) on equity investments, net   4    (2 )   12          Total  $ (61 )  $ 213   $ 115          ##TABLE_END  Note 9: Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, derivative financial instruments, loans receivable, and trade receivables. We enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. For presentation on our consolidated balance sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterpartys relative credit standing. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with A/A2 or better rated issuers, and a majority of the issuers are rated AA-/Aa3 or better. Our investment policy requires substantially all investments with original maturities at the time of investment of up to six months to be rated at least A-2/P-2 by Standard  Poors/Moodys, and specifies a higher minimum rating for investments with longer maturities. For instance, investments with maturities of greater than three years require a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3 at the time of investment. Government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, or the absence of A rated counterparties in certain countries, result in some minor exceptions. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterpartys obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of December 31, 2011, the total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding U.S. Treasury securities, did not exceed $750 million. We obtain and secure available collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions, when we deem it appropriate. A substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers. We also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and retail distributors. Our two largest customers accounted for 34% of net revenue for 2011 and 38% of net revenue for 2010 and 2009. Additionally, these two largest customers accounted for 32% of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2011 and 44% of our accounts receivable as of December 25, 2010. We believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe that credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis, and from this analysis, we establish credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices, such as obtaining a third-party guarantee or standby letter of credit, or obtaining credit insurance.  ##TABLE_START 63 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Note 10: Other Long-Term Assets Other long-term assets as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010  Equity method investments  $ 1,669   $ 1,791  Non-marketable cost method investments   1,129    872  Non-current deferred tax assets   335    289  Loans receivable   715    741  Other   800    558       Total other long-term assets  $ 4,648   $ 4,251       ##TABLE_END Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments Equity Method Investments Equity method investments as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    2011   2010  (In Millions, Except Percentages)  Carrying Value   Ownership Percentage   Carrying Value   Ownership Percentage  IM Flash Technologies, LLC  $ 863    49 %  $ 1,126    49 % IM Flash Singapore, LLP   466    18 %   335    22 % Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC   167    50 %         SMART Technologies, Inc.   37    14 %   31    14 % Clearwire Communications, LLC       7 %   145    7 % Other equity method investments   136     154          Total  $ 1,669    $ 1,791          ##TABLE_END  IMFT/IMFS Micron and Intel formed IM Flash Technologies, LLC (IMFT) and IM Flash Singapore, LLP (IMFS) to manufacture NAND flash memory products for Micron and Intel. The carrying value of our investment in IMFT/IMFS was $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2011 ($1.5 billion as of December 25, 2010) and is classified within other long-term assets. In the third quarter of 2011, we made an additional investment of $131 million in IMFS. The IMFS fabrication facility began initial production in the second quarter of 2011. IMFT and IMFS are each governed by a Board of Managers, with Micron and Intel initially appointing an equal number of managers to each of the boards. The number of managers appointed by each party adjusts depending on the parties ownership interests. As a result of our overall net reduction of our ownership interest in IMFS, Micron now appoints the majority of the managers on the IMFS board. Through our remaining managers on the IMFS board, we continue to have significant influence over the operations of IMFS, and therefore continue to account for our interests using the equity method of accounting. These ventures are expected to operate until 2016 but are subject to earlier termination under certain terms and conditions. These joint ventures are variable interest entities. All costs of the joint ventures will be passed on to Micron and Intel through our purchase agreements. IMFT and IMFS are dependent upon Micron and Intel for any additional cash requirements. Our known maximum exposure to loss approximated the carrying value of our investment balance in IMFT/IMFS as of December 31, 2011. Except for the amount due to IMFT/IMFS for product purchases and services, we did not have any additional liabilities recognized on our consolidated balance sheets in connection with our interests in these joint ventures as of December 31, 2011. Future cash calls could increase our investment balance and the related exposure to loss. Potential future losses could be higher than the carrying amount of our investment, as Intel and Micron are liable for other future operating costs or obligations of IMFT/IMFS. Finally, as we are currently committed to purchasing 49% of IMFTs and 22% of IMFSs production output and production-related services, we may be required to purchase products at a cost in excess of realizable value. As of December 31, 2011, our contractual commitment to purchase product output and fund production-related services from IMFS adjusts to changes in our ownership percentage on an eight-month lag.  ##TABLE_START 64 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Our portion of IMFT/IMFS costs, primarily related to product purchases and production-related services, was approximately $985 million during 2011 (approximately $795 million during 2010 and approximately $755 million during 2009). The amount due to IMFT/IMFS for product purchases and services provided was approximately $125 million as of December 31, 2011 (approximately $105 million as of December 25, 2010). During 2011, $263 million was returned to Intel by IMFT/IMFS, which is reflected as a return of equity method investment within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows ($199 million during 2010 and $449 million during 2009). In 2010, IMFT increased its capital expenditures compared to 2009. The cash used for those capital expenditures reduced the amount of cash provided by IMFT to us as a return of equity method investment in 2010. Costs that Intel and Micron have incurred for product development and process development related to IMFT/IMFS are generally split evenly between Intel and Micron and are generally classified in research and development. Under the accounting standards for consolidating variable interest entities, the consolidating investor is the entity with the power to direct the activities of the venture that most significantly impact the ventures economic performance and with the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the venture that could potentially be significant to the venture. We have determined that we do not have both of these characteristics and, therefore, we account for our interests using the equity method of accounting. Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC In the first quarter of 2011, Intel and General Electric Company (GE) formed an equally owned joint venture, Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC (Care Innovations), in the healthcare industry that focuses on independent living and delivery of health-related services via telecommunications. The company was formed by combining assets of GE Healthcares Home Health division and Intels Digital Health Group. As a result of the formation of Care Innovations, we recognized a gain of $164 million in the first quarter of 2011 that is recorded in interest and other, net. Care Innovations is dependent upon Intel and GE for any additional cash requirements and, therefore, is a variable interest entity. Our known maximum exposure to loss approximated the carrying value of our investment balance in Care Innovations as of December 31, 2011. In addition to the potential loss of our existing investment, our actual losses could be higher, as we are liable to contribute additional future funding up to $38 million if Care Innovations meets established milestones. Intel and GE equally share the power to direct all of Care Innovations activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. As a result, we account for our interests in Care Innovations under the equity method of accounting. SMART Technologies, Inc. We hold an equity interest in SMART and account for our interest using the equity method of accounting. In 2010, SMART completed an initial public offering of shares approved for listing on The NASDAQ Global Select Market*. We sold approximately 10 million of our 27.5 million shares in the secondary offering. We recognized a gain of $181 million on the initial public offering and subsequent sale of our shares in the secondary offering, which is included in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Clearwire Communications, LLC In 2008, we invested in Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Clearwire Corporation. Our investment in Clearwire LLC is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and our proportionate share of the income or loss is recognized on a one-quarter lag. We recognize our proportionate share of losses to the extent that our investment has a positive carrying value. During 2011, we recognized $145 million of equity method losses ($116 million in 2010). During 2009, we recorded $27 million of equity method losses, which was net of a gain of $37 million as a result of a dilution of our ownership interest from an additional investment. These equity method losses are included in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Numonyx B.V. In 2008, we divested our NOR flash memory business in exchange for an ownership interest in Numonyx. Our investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and our proportionate share of the income or loss was recognized on a one-quarter lag. During 2010, we recognized $42 million of equity method gains ($31 million of equity method losses in 2009) within gains (losses) on equity investments, net. During the second quarter of 2010, we sold our ownership interest in Numonyx to Micron and recognized a gain on the sale of $91 million, which is included in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. In exchange for our investment in Numonyx, we received 57.9 million shares of Micron common stock, with an additional 8.6 million shares held in escrow for 12 months after the sale, and we issued a $72 million short-term note payable, which was subsequently paid.  ##TABLE_START 65 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  In the fourth quarter of 2010, we sold 21.5 million shares of Micron common stock, which consisted of the 8.6 million shares held in escrow and an additional 12.9 million shares received in the sale of Numonyx. In 2011, we sold the remaining Micron shares. Cost Method Investments The carrying value of our non-marketable cost method investments was $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2011 and $872 million as of December 25, 2010. In 2011, we recognized impairment charges on non-marketable cost method investments of $56 million within gains (losses) on equity investments, net ($109 million in 2010 and $179 million in 2009).

On February 28, 2011, we completed the acquisition of McAfee by acquiring all issued and outstanding common shares in exchange for cash. The acquired company continues to operate as McAfee and offers products for endpoint security, network and content security, risk and compliance, and consumer and mobile security. In addition to managing the existing McAfee business, the objective of the acquisition was to accelerate and enhance Intels combination of hardware and software security solutions, improving the overall security of our platforms. Total consideration to acquire McAfee was $6.7 billion (net of $943 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired) and comprised the following: ##TABLE_START 000,000 (In Millions)     Cash  $ 6,652  Share-based awards assumed   48     Total  $ 6,700     ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START 66 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major class in the acquisition of McAfee were recognized as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 (In Millions)     Marketable debt securities  $ 329  Goodwill   4,299  Identified intangible assets   3,552  Deferred tax assets   738  Other assets   417  Deferred income   (1,049 ) Deferred tax liabilities   (1,191 ) Other liabilities   (395 )    Total  $ 6,700     ##TABLE_END The goodwill of $4.3 billion arising from the acquisition is primarily attributed to synergies to enable a single company to combine security and hardware for the protection of online devices, as well as the assembled workforce of McAfee. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is not deductible for tax purposes. For information on the assignment of goodwill to our operating segments for the acquisition, see Note 16: Goodwill.

Customer relationships represent the fair values of the underlying relationships and agreements with McAfees customers. In-process research and development represents the fair values of incomplete McAfee research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition. Incremental costs incurred for those projects are expensed as incurred in research and development. Since the acquisition was completed, most of the projects have been completed and the associated costs are being amortized. Trade names are indefinite-lived intangible assets and represent the fair values of brand and name recognition associated with the marketing of McAfees products and services. Other 2011 Acquisitions During 2011, in addition to the McAfee acquisition, we completed 13 acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for total consideration of $2.1 billion, substantially all cash consideration. Total net cash consideration to acquire the Wireless Solutions (WLS) business of Infineon Technologies AG, which operates as Intel Mobile Communications, was $1.4 billion. The WLS business offers mobile phone components such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers, and power management integrated circuits. In addition to managing the existing WLS business, the objective of the acquisition was to provide solutions that enable wireless connectivity for a broad range of computing applications. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major class in the acquisitions completed during 2011, excluding McAfee, were allocated as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 (In Millions)     Fair value of net tangible assets acquired  $ 206  Goodwill   517  Identified intangible assets   1,409     Total  $ 2,132     ##TABLE_END For information on the assignment of goodwill to our operating segments for the acquisitions, see Note 16: Goodwill.  ##TABLE_START 67 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  The identified intangible assets assumed in the acquisitions completed during 2011, excluding McAfee, were recognized as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000    Fair Value (In Millions)   Estimated Useful Life (In Years)  Developed technology  $ 1,102    39  Customer relationships   144    58  Other intangible assets   44    27      Total identified intangible assets subject to amortization  $ 1,290   In-process research and development   119       Total identified intangible assets  $ 1,409       ##TABLE_END Acquired developed technology represents the fair values of the acquirees products that have reached technological feasibility and are a part of the acquirees product lines at the time acquired. Customer relationships represent the fair values of the underlying relationships and agreements with the acquirees customers. In-process research and development represents the fair values of incomplete research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition. In the future, the fair value of each project at the acquisition date will be either amortized or impaired, depending on whether the project is completed or abandoned. As of December 31, 2011, no projects had been completed or abandoned. Actual and Pro Forma Results of Acquirees Net revenue and net income attributable to acquisitions completed during 2011 have been included in our consolidated statements of income from their respective acquisition dates to the period ended December 31, 2011. The acquisitions completed during 2011 were not individually significant to our consolidated results of operations; however, they were significant in the aggregate. During 2011, the results of the businesses acquired in 2011 contributed approximately $3.6 billion to our net revenue and reduced our net income by approximately $275 million; substantially all of these impacts were attributable to McAfee and Intel Mobile Communications and include the impacts of the amortization of acquired identified intangible assets. McAfee is a non-reportable operating segment and is aggregated with similar non-reportable operating segments within the software and services operating segments category for segment reporting purposes. Intel Mobile Communications is a non-reportable operating segment and is aggregated with similar non-reportable operating segments within the other Intel architecture operating segments category for segment reporting purposes. For further information, see Note 30: Operating Segment and Geographic Information. The unaudited pro forma financial results for 2011 and 2010 combine the historical results of Intel for 2011 and 2010, respectively, along with the historical results of the businesses acquired during 2011 for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The results include the effects of pro forma adjustments as if businesses acquired in 2011 were acquired on December 27, 2009. The 2010 pro forma results include a non-recurring adjustment of $307 million, which reduces net income due to the revaluation of McAfees historic deferred revenue to fair value. The unaudited pro forma financial results presented below do not include any anticipated synergies or other expected benefits of the acquisitions. This is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of future operations or results that would have been achieved had the acquisitions been completed as of December 27, 2009. ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 (In Millions, Except Per Share AmountsUnaudited)  2011   2010  Net revenue  $ 54,738   $ 47,350  Net income  $ 13,028   $ 11,190  Diluted earnings per share  $ 2.41   $ 1.96  ##TABLE_END 2010 and 2009 Acquisitions During 2010, we completed three business acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate net cash consideration of $218 million. Substantially all of the consideration was allocated to goodwill and intangibles. During the third quarter of 2009, we completed two acquisitions qualifying as business combinations for total consideration of $885 million (net of $59 million cash acquired). Substantially all of this amount related to the acquisition of Wind River Systems, Inc., a vendor of software for embedded devices, completed by acquiring all issued and outstanding Wind River Systems common shares. The objective of the acquisition of Wind River Systems was to enable the introduction of products for the embedded and mobile market segments, resulting in benefits for our existing operations.  ##TABLE_START 68 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  The combined consideration for acquisitions completed during 2009 was allocated as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 (In Millions)     Fair value of net tangible assets acquired  $ 47  Goodwill   489  Acquired developed technology   148  Other identified intangible assets   169  Share-based awards assumed   32     Total  $ 885     ##TABLE_END The completed acquisitions in 2010 and 2009, both individually and in the aggregate, were not significant to our consolidated results of operations. Note 15: Divestitures In the first quarter of 2011, we completed the divestiture of our Digital Health Group by entering into an agreement with GE to form an equally owned joint venture to create a new healthcare company focused on independent living and delivery of health-related services via telecommunications. The new company, Care Innovations, was formed by combining assets of GE Healthcares Home Health division and Intels Digital Health Group. During the first quarter of 2011, as a result of the formation of Care Innovations, we recognized a gain of $164 million, within interest and other, net. For further information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments. Note 16: Goodwill Goodwill activity for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 was as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  PC Client Group   Data Center Group   Other Intel Architecture Operating Segments   Software and Services Operating Segments   Total  December 26, 2009  $ 2,220   $ 1,459   $ 507   $ 235   $ 4,421  Additions due to acquisitions   14        75    21    110             December 25, 2010  $ 2,234   $ 1,459   $ 582   $ 256   $ 4,531  Additions due to McAfee acquisition   746            3,553    4,299  Additions due to other acquisitions   24    94    176    223    517  Transfers   (86 )       86          Effect of exchange rate fluctuations               (93 )   (93 )            December 31, 2011  $ 2,918   $ 1,553   $ 844   $ 3,939   $ 9,254             ##TABLE_END  The goodwill recognized from our acquisitions during 2010 was assigned to our Digital Home Group (combined within the Netbook and Tablet Group in 2011), our Software and Services Group, our Ultra-Mobility Group, our PC Client Group, and our Intelligent Systems Group (formerly known as the Embedded and Communications Group). Our Software and Services Group is included in the software and services operating segments category in the preceding table, while our Netbook and Tablet Group, our Ultra-Mobility Group, and our Intelligent Systems Group are all included in the other Intel architecture operating segments category. During the first quarter of 2011, we formed the Netbook and Tablet Group, which includes platforms designed for the netbook and tablet market segments. Due to the formation of this new operating segment, goodwill was transferred from our PC Client Group to our Netbook and Tablet Group as shown in the preceding table. Our Netbook and Tablet Group is included in the other Intel architecture operating segments category in the preceding table. During the first quarter of 2011, we completed the acquisition of McAfee. The goodwill recognized from this acquisition was allocated between the McAfee operating segment and the PC Client Group based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition, which reflected the estimated synergistic value generated within the PC Client Group from incorporating McAfees security expertise, reputation, and customer base. The goodwill recognized from our other acquisitions during 2011 was allocated to McAfee, the Software and Services Group, Intel Mobile Communications, the Data Center Group, the Ultra-Mobility Group, and the PC Client Group. McAfee and the Software and Services Group are included in the software and services operating segments category in the preceding table, while Intel Mobile Communications and the Ultra-Mobility Group are included in the other Intel architecture operating segments category. For further information about our acquisitions during 2011, see Note 14: Acquisitions.  ##TABLE_START 69 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  During the fourth quarters of 2011, 2010, and 2009, we completed our annual impairment assessments, and impairment tests when necessary, and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years. The accumulated impairment losses as of December 31, 2011 were $713 million: $341 million associated with our PC Client Group, $279 million associated with our Data Center Group, and $93 million associated with other Intel architecture operating segments. Note 17: Identified Intangible Assets Identified intangible assets consisted of the following as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000    December 31, 2011  (In Millions)  Gross Assets   Accumulated Amortization   Net  Acquisition-related developed technology  $ 2,615   $ (570 )  $ 2,045  Acquisition-related customer relationships   1,714    (254 )   1,460  Acquisition-related trade names   68    (21 )   47  Licensed technology   2,395    (707 )   1,688         Identified intangible assets subject to amortization  $ 6,792   $ (1,552 )  $ 5,240  Acquisition-related trade names   806        806  Other intangible assets   221        221         Identified intangible assets not subject to amortization  $ 1,027   $    $ 1,027         Total identified intangible assets  $ 7,819   $ (1,552 )  $ 6,267         ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000    December 25, 2010  (In Millions)  Gross Assets   Accumulated Amortization   Net  Acquisition-related developed technology  $ 235   $ (97 )  $ 138  Acquisition-related customer relationships   152    (10 )   142  Acquisition-related trade names   46    (10 )   36  Licensed technology   1,204    (765 )   439         Identified intangible assets subject to amortization  $ 1,637   $ (882 )  $ 755  Other intangible assets   105        105         Total identified intangible assets  $ 1,742   $ (882 )  $ 860         ##TABLE_END  As a result of our acquisition of McAfee during the first quarter of 2011, we recorded $3.6 billion of identified intangible assets. In addition, as a result of our other acquisitions during 2011, we recorded $1.4 billion of identified intangible assets, the substantial majority of which was from the acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon. For further information about identified intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions during 2011, see Note 14: Acquisitions. In January 2011, we entered into a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA. Under the agreement, we received a license to all of NVIDIAs patents with a capture period that runs through March 2017 while NVIDIA products are licensed to our patents, subject to exclusions for x86 products, certain chipsets, and certain flash memory technology products. The agreement also included settlement of the existing litigation between the companies as well as broad mutual general releases. We agreed to make payments totaling $1.5 billion to NVIDIA over six years ($300 million in each of January 2011, 2012, and 2013; and $200 million in each of January 2014, 2015, and 2016), which resulted in a liability totaling approximately $1.4 billion, on a discounted basis. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we recognized an expense of $100 million related to the litigation settlement. In the first quarter of 2011, we recognized the remaining amount of $1.3 billion as licensed technology, which will be amortized into cost of sales over its estimated useful life of 17 years. The initial recognition of the intangible asset and associated liability for future payments to NVIDIA is treated as a non-cash transaction and, therefore, has no impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Future payments will be treated as cash used for financing activities. As of December 31, 2011, the remaining liability of $1.2 billion is classified within other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, based on the expected timing of the underlying payments. As a result of our acquisitions in 2010, we recorded acquisition-related developed technology for $37 million with lives of four years, and additions to acquisition-related customer relationships of $58 million with a weighted average life of seven years. In addition, we acquired other intangible assets for $104 million in 2010 that are not subject to amortization.  ##TABLE_START 70 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  We recorded amortization expense on the consolidated statements of income as follows: acquisition-related developed technology and licensed technology substantially all are in cost of sales, and acquisition-related customer relationships and trade names in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Amortization expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010   2009  Acquisition-related developed technology  $ 482   $ 65   $ 30  Acquisition-related customer relationships  $ 250   $ 10   $   Acquisition-related trade names  $ 10   $ 8   $ 3  Licensed technology  $ 181   $ 157   $ 149  Other intangible assets  $    $    $ 126  ##TABLE_END Based on identified intangible assets that are subject to amortization as of December 31, 2011, we expect future amortization expense to be as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2012   2013   2014   2015   2016  Acquisition-related developed technology  $ 541   $ 526   $ 504   $ 235   $ 154  Acquisition-related customer relationships  $ 283   $ 265   $ 260   $ 252   $ 234  Acquisition-related trade names  $ 11   $ 11   $ 10   $ 10   $ 4  Licensed technology  $ 181   $ 164   $ 154   $ 135   $ 120  ##TABLE_END Note 18: Deferred Income Deferred income at the end of each period was as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  Dec. 31, 2011   Dec. 25, 2010  Deferred income on shipments of components to distributors  $ 751   $ 622  Deferred income from software and services operating segments   1,178    125       Current deferred income  $ 1,929   $ 747  Non-current deferred income from software and services operating segments   460    21       Total deferred income  $ 2,389   $ 768       ##TABLE_END We classify non-current deferred income from the software and services operating segments in other long-term liabilities. Note 19: Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges The following table summarizes restructuring and asset impairment charges by plan for the three years ended December 31, 2011: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010   2009  2009 restructuring program  $    $    $ 215  2006 efficiency program           16         Total restructuring and asset impairment charges  $    $    $ 231         ##TABLE_END 2009 Restructuring Program In the first quarter of 2009, management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing and assembly and test operations. These plans included closing two assembly and test facilities in Malaysia, one facility in the Philippines, and one facility in China; stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Oregon; and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in California. The 2009 restructuring program is complete. Under the 2009 restructuring program, we incurred $208 million in charges related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 6,500 employees, and $7 million in asset impairment charges. 2006 Efficiency Program In the third quarter of 2006, management approved several actions as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results. The 2006 efficiency program is complete. From the third quarter of 2006 through 2009, we incurred a total of $1.6 billion in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this program.  ##TABLE_START 71 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Note 20: Chipset Design Issue In January 2011, as part of our ongoing quality assurance procedures, we identified a design issue with the Intel  6 Series Express Chipset family (formerly code named Cougar Point). The issue affected chipsets sold in the fourth quarter of 2010 and January 2011. We subsequently implemented a silicon fix, and began shipping the updated version of the affected chipset in February 2011. We estimate that the total cost to repair and replace affected materials and systems, located with customers and in the market, will be $733 million. We recorded a charge of $311 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, which comprised $67 million in product costs for the affected chipsets and $244 million to establish a product accrual for this issue. We recognized a charge of $343 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily related to an additional product accrual for the estimated costs to repair and replace affected materials and systems associated with products sold subsequent to December 25, 2010. In the second quarter of 2011, we recognized an additional $79 million charge as we finalized agreements with customers for reimbursement to repair and replace affected materials and systems. We do not expect to have any significant future adjustments to our estimate. The charges incurred in 2011 and 2010 are reflected in the results of the PC Client Group operating segment. As of December 31, 2011, the remaining product accrual for the chipset design issue was $64 million and is classified within other accrued liabilities. Note 21: Borrowings Short-Term Debt Short-term debt included drafts payable of $47 million as of December 31, 2011 ($38 million as of December 25, 2010). We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2011 were $1.4 billion ($150 million during 2010). We had $200 million of outstanding commercial paper as of December 31, 2011 (none as of December 25, 2010). Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard  Poors and P-1 by Moodys as of December 31, 2011. Long-Term Debt Our long-term debt as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 was as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010  Senior notes due 2016 at 1.95%  $ 1,498   $   Senior notes due 2021 at 3.30%   1,995      Senior notes due 2041 at 4.80%   1,489      2009 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2039 at 3.25%   1,052    1,041  2005 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2035 at 2.95%   919    908  2007 Arizona bonds due 2037 at 5.30%   131    128       Total long-term debt  $ 7,084   $ 2,077       ##TABLE_END  Senior Notes In the third quarter of 2011, we issued $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (the notes). The notes pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually. We may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at any time at our option at specified redemption prices. The notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and will effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries. The notes were issued primarily to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program, and for general corporate purposes. Convertible Debentures In 2009, we issued $2.0 billion of junior subordinated convertible debentures (the 2009 debentures). In 2005, we issued $1.6 billion of junior subordinated convertible debentures (the 2005 debentures). Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually. ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000    2009 Debentures   2005 Debentures  Annual coupon interest rate   3.25 %   2.95 % Annual effective interest rate   7.20 %   6.45 % Maximum amount of contingent interest that will accrue per year   0.50 %   0.40 % ##TABLE_END The effective interest rate is based on the rate for a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature.  ##TABLE_START 72 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures have a contingent interest component that requires us to pay interest based on certain thresholds and for certain events, commencing on August 1, 2019 for the 2009 debentures. As of December 31, 2011, we have not met any of the thresholds and events related to the 2005 debentures. The fair values of the related embedded derivatives were $10 million and zero as of December 31, 2011 for the 2009 and 2005 debentures, respectively ($12 million and $19 million as of December 25, 2010 for the 2009 and 2005 debentures, respectively). Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into shares of our common stock. Holders can surrender the 2009 debentures for conversion if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter. Holders can surrender the 2005 debentures for conversion at any time. We will settle any conversion or repurchase of the 2009 debentures in cash up to the face value, and any amount in excess of face value will be settled in cash or stock at our option. However, we can settle any conversion or repurchase of the 2005 debentures in cash or stock at our option. On or after August 5, 2019, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2009 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the date on which we provide notice of redemption. On or after December 15, 2012, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2005 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the date on which we provide notice of redemption. If certain events occur in the future, the indentures governing the 2009 and 2005 debentures provide that each holder of the debentures can, for a pre-defined period of time, require us to repurchase the holders debentures for the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures are subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior debt and to the other liabilities of our subsidiaries. We have concluded that both the 2009 and 2005 debentures are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded stock conversion options qualify as derivatives. In addition, we have concluded that the embedded conversion options would be classified in stockholders equity if they were freestanding derivative instruments. As such, the embedded conversion options are not accounted for separately as derivatives. ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    2009 Debentures   2005 Debentures  (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  Dec. 31, 2011   Dec. 25, 2010   Dec. 31, 2011   Dec. 25, 2010  Outstanding principal  $ 2,000   $ 2,000   $ 1,600   $ 1,600  Equity component carrying amount  $ 613   $ 613   $ 466   $ 466  Unamortized discount  $ 933   $ 943   $ 669   $ 680  Net debt carrying amount  $ 1,052   $ 1,041   $ 919   $ 908  Conversion rate (shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures)   44.55    44.09    32.94    32.52  Effective conversion price (per share of common stock)  $ 22.45   $ 22.68   $ 30.36   $ 30.75  ##TABLE_END  In the preceding table, the remaining amortization periods for the unamortized discounts for the 2009 and 2005 debentures are approximately 28 and 24 years, respectively, as of December 31, 2011. The conversion rate adjusts for certain events outlined in the indentures governing the 2009 and 2005 debentures, such as quarterly dividend distributions in excess of $0.14 and $0.10 per share for the 2009 and 2005 debentures, respectively, but does not adjust for accrued interest. In addition, the conversion rate will increase for a holder of either the 2009 or 2005 debentures who elects to convert the debentures in connection with certain share exchanges, mergers, or consolidations involving Intel. Arizona Bonds In 2007, we guaranteed repayment of principal and interest on bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona, which constitute an unsecured general obligation for Intel. The aggregate principal amount of the bonds issued in December 2007 is $125 million, and the bonds bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.3%. The 2007 Arizona bonds are subject to mandatory tender, at our option, on any interest payment date beginning on or after December 1, 2012 until their final maturity on December 1, 2037. Upon such tender, we can re-market the bonds as either fixed-rate bonds for a specified period or as variable-rate bonds until their final maturity. We also entered into a total return swap agreement that effectively converts the fixed-rate obligation on the bonds to a floating U.S.-dollar LIBOR-based rate. We have elected to account for the 2007 Arizona bonds at fair value. For further discussion, see Note 5: Fair Value.  ##TABLE_START 73 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Debt Maturities As of December 31, 2011, our aggregate debt maturities based on outstanding principal were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START 000,000 Year Payable     2012  $   2013     2014     2015     2016   1,500  2017 and thereafter   7,225     Total  $ 8,725     ##TABLE_END Substantially all of the difference between the total aggregate debt maturities above and the total carrying amount of our debt is due to the unamortized discount of our convertible debentures. Note 22: Retirement Benefit Plans Retirement Contribution Plans We provide tax-qualified retirement contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. and certain other countries. The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees hired prior to January 1, 2011 are eligible for the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan, while employees hired on or after January 1, 2011 receive discretionary employer contributions in the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan. Our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) determines the annual discretionary employer contribution amounts for the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan and the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan under delegation of authority from our Board of Directors, pursuant to the terms of the plans. As of December 31, 2011, 68% of our U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan assets were invested in equities, 25% were invested in fixed-income instruments, and 7% were invested in real assets. These assets are managed by external investment managers. The discretionary employer contributions made to the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan are participant directed. For the benefit of eligible U.S. employees, we also provide a non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees. This plan is designed to permit certain discretionary employer contributions and to permit employee deferral of a portion of compensation in addition to their Intel 401(k) Savings Plan deferrals. This plan is unfunded. We expensed $340 million for the qualified and non-qualified U.S. retirement contribution plans in 2011 ($319 million in 2010 and $260 million in 2009). In the first quarter of 2012, we funded $320 million for the 2011 contributions to the qualified U.S. retirement contribution plans. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans U.S. Pension Benefits. For employees hired prior to January 1, 2011, we provide a tax-qualified defined-benefit pension plan, the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan, for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. The U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan benefit is determined by a participants years of service and final average compensation (taking into account the participants social security wage base). The plan generates a minimum pension benefit if the participants U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan benefit exceeds the annuitized value of his or her U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan benefit. If participant balances in the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan do not grow sufficiently, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan could increase significantly. Non-U.S. Pension Benefits. We also provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain other countries. Consistent with the requirements of local law, we deposit funds for certain plans with insurance companies, with third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts, and/or accrue for the unfunded portion of the obligation. U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits. Upon retirement, eligible U.S. employees are credited with a defined dollar amount, based on years of service, into a U.S. Sheltered Employee Retirement Medical Account (SERMA). In 2010, we approved a plan amendment, effective January 1, 2011, to expand use of these credits to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase coverage in the retirees choice of medical plan. Prior to 2011, these credits could only be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase coverage in an Intel-sponsored medical plan. If the available credits are not sufficient to pay the entire cost of the coverage, the remaining cost is the retirees responsibility. Funding Policy. Our practice is to fund the various pension plans and the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of U.S. federal laws and regulations or applicable local laws and regulations. Additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate. Depending on the design of the plan, local customs, and market circumstances, the liabilities of a plan may exceed qualified plan assets.  ##TABLE_START 74 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets The changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets for the plans described above were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    U.S. Pension Benefits   Non-U.S. Pension Benefits   U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits  (In Millions)  2011   2010   2011   2010   2011   2010  Change in projected benefit obligation:       Beginning benefit obligation  $ 739   $ 567   $ 902   $ 653   $ 297   $ 200  Service cost   51    38    63    40    18    16  Interest cost   42    34    52    35    16    14  Plan acquisitions           68              Plan participants contributions           10    8    4    4  Actuarial (gain) loss   688    123    98    187    45    7  Currency exchange rate changes           (38 )   (4 )         Plan amendments               3        65  Plan curtailments           (6 )             Plan settlements           (13 )             Benefits paid to plan participants   (40 )   (23 )   (15 )   (20 )   (11 )   (9 )              Ending projected benefit obligation  $ 1,480   $ 739   $ 1,121   $ 902   $ 369   $ 297               ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    U.S. Pension Benefits   Non-U.S. Pension Benefits   U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits  (In Millions)  2011   2010   2011   2010   2011   2010  Change in plan assets:       Beginning fair value of plan assets  $ 569   $ 411   $ 642   $ 552   $ 59   $ 2  Actual return on plan assets   26    18    (26 )   53    1    (2 ) Plan acquisitions           72              Employer contributions   93    163    76    52    63    64  Plan participants contributions           10    8    4    4  Currency exchange rate changes           (24 )   (3 )         Plan settlements           (13 )             Benefits paid to plan participants   (40 )   (23 )   (15 )   (20 )   (11 )   (9 )              Ending fair value of plan assets  $ 648   $ 569   $ 722   $ 642   $ 116   $ 59               ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    U.S. Pension Benefits   Non-U.S. Pension Benefits   U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits  (In Millions)  2011   2010   2011   2010   2011   2010  Other long-term assets  $    $    $ 6   $ 35   $    $   Accrued compensation and benefits           (7 )   (6 )         Other long-term liabilities   (832 )   (170 )   (398 )   (289 )   (253 )   (238 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (income), before tax   1,039    373    330    185    66    27               Net amount recognized  $ 207   $ 203   $ (69 )  $ (75 )  $ (187 )  $ (211 )              ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START 75 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  The following table summarizes the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) before taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    U.S. Pension Benefits   Non-U.S. Pension Benefits   U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits  (In Millions)  2011   2010   2011   2010   2011   2010  Net prior service credit (cost)  $    $    $ 14   $ 15   $ (63 )  $ (71 ) Net actuarial gain (loss)   (1,039 )   (373 )   (344 )   (200 )   (3 )   44               Defined benefit plans, net  $ (1,039 )  $ (373 )  $ (330 )  $ (185 )  $ (66 )  $ (27 )              ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2011, the accumulated benefit obligation was $426 million for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan ($284 million as of December 25, 2010) and $836 million for the non-U.S. defined-benefit pension plans ($632 million as of December 25, 2010).

We then matched the benefit payment streams by year to the AA corporate bond rates to match the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments and discounted back to the measurement date to determine the appropriate discount rate. For the non-U.S. plans, we used two approaches to develop the discount rate. In certain countries, we used a model consisting of a theoretical bond portfolio for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximated the estimated benefit payments of our pension plans. In other countries, we analyzed current market long-term bond rates and matched the bond maturity with the average duration of the pension liabilities. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions take into consideration both duration and risk of the investment portfolios, and are developed through consensus and building-block methodologies. The consensus methodology includes unadjusted estimates by the fund manager on future market expectations by broad asset classes and geography. The building-block approach determines the rates of return implied by historical risk premiums across asset classes. In addition, we analyzed rates of return relevant to the country where each plan is in effect and the investments applicable to the plan, expectations of future returns, local actuarial projections, and the projected long-term rates of return from external investment managers. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets shown for the non-U.S. plan assets is weighted to reflect each countrys relative portion of the non-U.S. plan assets.

The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 80% to 90% for fixed-income debt instrument investments and 10% to 20% for hedge fund investments. The expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets is 5.0%.  ##TABLE_START 77 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following investment categories as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    December 31, 2011     Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using   Total  (In Millions)  Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Equity securities:     Hedge fund pool  $    $ 97   $    $ 97  Fixed income:     Global Bond Fundcommon collective trusts       51        51  Global Bond Fundgovernment bonds   94    166        260  Global Bond Fundasset-backed securities           78    78  Global Bond Fundcorporate bonds       147        147  Global Bond Fundother       6        6           Total assets measured at fair value  $ 94   $ 467   $ 78   $ 639           Cash      9        Total U.S. pension plan assets at fair value     $ 648        ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    December 25, 2010     Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using   Total  (In Millions)  Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Equity securities:     U.S. Large Cap Stock Fund  $    $ 36   $    $ 36  U.S. Small Cap Stock Fund       9        9  International Stock Fund   11    30        41  Fixed income:     U.S. treasuries       261        261  U.S. corporate bonds       79        79  Global Bond Fundcommon collective trusts       62        62  Global Bond Fundgovernment bonds   18    22        40  Global Bond Fundasset-backed securities           17    17  Global Bond Fundcorporate bonds       19        19  Global Bond Fundother   3    2        5           Total U.S. pension plan assets at fair value  $ 32   $ 520   $ 17   $ 569           ##TABLE_END  The Global Bond Funds target allocation is approximately 30% of assets in government and high-quality corporate bonds and asset-backed securities to mitigate risks related to deflation, 15% in global inflation-indexed bonds to provide protection from inflation, and another 15% in international government and corporate bonds. The residual 40% of the fund is allocated to opportunistic bond investments, which are used to enhance return and provide diversification. Such opportunistic bond investments include emerging market debt instruments with un-hedged currency exposure, high-yield investments, asset- and mortgage-backed securities, and corporate credit. Government bonds include bonds issued or deemed to be guaranteed by government entities. Government bonds include instruments such as non-U.S. government bonds, U.S. Treasury securities, and U.S. agency securities. We classified asset-backed securities in the Global Bond Fund as Level 3, as we have used unobservable inputs to the valuations that were significant to the fair value measurements. The majority of the increase in asset-backed securities in 2011 represents current-year purchases. The U.S. treasuries category in the preceding table represents two common collective trust funds that sought to replicate the performance of the Barclays Capital U.S. 13 Year Treasury Bond Index and Barclays Capital U.S. 13 Year Agency Bond Index over the long term. The U.S. corporate bonds category in the table represents a common collective trust fund that sought to replicate the performance of the Barclays Capital U.S. 13 Year Credit Bond Index over the long term.  ##TABLE_START 78 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Non-U.S. Plan Assets The investments of the non-U.S. plans are managed by insurance companies, third-party trustees, or pension funds, consistent with regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. The investment manager evaluates performance by comparing the actual rate of return to the return on other similar assets. Investments managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under standard contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we have discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equities and fixed-income debt instruments, either through index funds or direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or individual securities in order to reduce market risk and assure that the pension assets are available to pay benefits as they come due. The average expected long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plan assets is 5.8%.

The Investments held by insurance companies and Insurance contracts categories in the preceding tables are managed by qualified insurance companies. We do not have control over the target allocation or visibility of the investment strategies of those investments. Insurance contracts and investments held by insurance companies made up 33% of total non-U.S. plan assets as of December 31, 2011 (36% as of December 25, 2010). The target allocation of the non-U.S. plan assets that we have control over is 49% equity securities and 51% fixed-income instruments.  ##TABLE_START 79 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  U.S. Postretirement Medical Plan Assets In general, the investment strategy for U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets is to primarily invest in liquid assets due to the level of expected future benefit payments. The expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets is 3.0%. As of December 31, 2011, all of the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets were invested in a money market fund and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. Concentrations of Risk We manage a variety of risks, including market, credit, and liquidity risks, across our plan assets through our investment managers. We define a concentration of risk as an undiversified exposure to one of the aforementioned risks that increases the exposure of the loss of plan assets unnecessarily. We monitor exposure to such risks in both the U.S. and non-U.S. plans by monitoring the magnitude of the risk in each plan and diversifying our exposure to such risks across a variety of instruments, markets, and counterparties. As of December 31, 2011, we did not have concentrations of risk in any single entity, manager, counterparty, sector, industry, or country. Funding Expectations Under applicable law for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan and the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan, we are not required to make any contributions during 2012. Our expected required funding for the non-U.S. plans during 2012 is approximately $65 million.

Other purchase obligations and commitments totaled approximately $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2011 (approximately $600 million as of December 25, 2010). Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include, for example, agreements to fund various projects with other companies. In addition, we have various contractual commitments with Micron and IMFT/IMFS.

In May 2011, stockholders approved an extension of the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan). Stockholders approved 168 million additional shares for issuance, increasing the total shares of common stock available for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors to 596 million shares. The approval also extended the expiration date of the 2006 Plan to June 2014. The maximum shares to be awarded as non-vested shares (restricted stock) or non-vested share units (restricted stock units) was increased to 394 million shares. As of December 31, 2011, 307 million shares remained available for future grant under the 2006 Plan. We may assume the equity incentive plans and the outstanding equity awards of certain acquired companies. Once they are assumed, we do not grant additional shares under those plans. In connection with our completed acquisitions of McAfee and Wind River Systems, we assumed their equity incentive plans and issued replacement awards in 2011 and 2009, respectively. The stock options and restricted stock units issued generally retain the terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted. In May 2009, stockholders approved an employee stock option exchange program (Option Exchange) to give employees (not listed officers) the opportunity to exchange eligible stock options for a lesser number of new stock options that have approximately the same fair value as the options surrendered, as of the date of the exchange. The Option Exchange commenced on September 28, 2009 and expired on October 30, 2009. Eligible options included stock options granted under any Intel stock option or equity incentive plan between October 1, 2000 and September 28, 2008 that had an exercise price above $20.83, which was the 52-week closing-price high as of October 30, 2009. A total of 217 million eligible stock options were tendered and cancelled in exchange for 83 million new stock options granted. The new stock options have an exercise price of $19.04, which is equal to the market price of Intel common stock (defined as the average of the high and low trading prices) on October 30, 2009. The new stock options were issued under the 2006 Plan and are subject to its terms and conditions. The new stock options vest in equal annual increments over a four-year period from the date of grant and will expire seven years from the grant date. Using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, we determined that the fair value of the surrendered stock options on a grant-by-grant basis was approximately equal, as of the date of the exchange, to the fair value of the eligible stock options exchanged, resulting in insignificant incremental share-based compensation. We issue restricted stock units with both a market condition and a service condition (market-based restricted stock units), referred to in our 2011 Proxy Statement as outperformance stock units, to a small group of senior officers and non-employee directors. For market-based restricted stock units issued in 2011, the number of shares of Intel common stock to be received at vesting will range from 50% to 200% of the target amount, based on total stockholder return (TSR) on Intel common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of a peer group over a three-year period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. As of December 31, 2011, there were 4 million market-based restricted stock units outstanding. These market-based restricted stock units accrue dividend equivalents and generally vest three years and one month from the grant date. Equity awards granted to employees in 2011 under our equity incentive plans generally vest over 4 years from the date of grant, and options expire 7 years from the date of grant, with the exception of market-based restricted stock units, a small number of restricted stock units granted to executive-level employees, and replacement awards related to acquisitions. The 2006 Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific dates. In May 2011, stockholders approved an extension of the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan. Stockholders approved 133 million additional shares for issuance, increasing the total shares of common stock available for issuance to 373 million shares. The approval also extended the expiration date of the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan to August 2016. As of December 31, 2011, 254 million shares were available for issuance under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation recognized in 2011 was $1.1 billion ($917 million in 2010 and $889 million in 2009). On a quarterly basis, we assess changes to our estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on our review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. We recognize the effect of adjustments made to the forfeiture rates, if any, in the period that we change the forfeiture estimate. The effect of forfeiture adjustments in 2011, 2010, and 2009 was not significant. The total share-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory as of December 31, 2011 was $38 million ($48 million as of December 25, 2010 and $33 million as of December 26, 2009). During 2011, the tax benefit that we realized for the tax deduction from share-based awards totaled $327 million ($266 million in 2010 and $119 million in 2009).  ##TABLE_START 81 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  We estimate the fair value of restricted stock unit awards with time-based vesting using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting. We estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock units using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant. We based the weighted average estimated values of restricted stock unit grants, as well as the weighted average assumptions that we used in calculating the fair value, on estimates at the date of grant, as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000    2011   2010   2009  Estimated values  $ 19.86   $ 22.56   $ 14.63  Risk-free interest rate   0.7 %   1.1 %   0.9 % Dividend yield   3.4 %   2.6 %   3.5 % Volatility   27 %   31 %   46 % ##TABLE_END We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted under our equity incentive plans and rights to acquire stock granted under our stock purchase plan. We based the weighted average estimated values of employee stock option grants (excluding stock option grants in connection with the Option Exchange in 2009) and rights granted under the stock purchase plan, as well as the weighted average assumptions used in calculating these values, on estimates at the date of grant, as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    Stock Options   Stock Purchase Plan     2011   2010   2009   2011   2010   2009  Estimated values  $ 3.91   $ 4.82   $ 4.72   $ 4.69   $ 4.71   $ 4.14  Expected life (in years)   5.4    4.9    4.9    0.5    0.5    0.5  Risk-free interest rate   2.2 %   2.5 %   1.8 %   0.2 %   0.2 %   0.4 % Volatility   27 %   28 %   46 %   26 %   32 %   44 % Dividend yield   3.4 %   2.7 %   3.6 %   3.6 %   3.1 %   3.6 % ##TABLE_END We base the expected volatility on implied volatility because we have determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. Prior to 2011, we used the simplified method of calculating expected life due to significant differences in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to our historical grants. In 2011, we began using historical option exercise data as the basis for determining expected life, as we believe we have sufficient historical data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected life input for valuing options using the Black-Scholes model. Restricted Stock Unit Awards Information with respect to outstanding restricted stock unit (RSU) activity is as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 (In Millions, Except Per RSU Amounts)  Number of RSUs   Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value  December 27, 2008   67.3   $ 20.18  Granted   60.0   $ 14.63  Assumed in acquisition   1.6   $ 17.52  Vested   (20.1 )  $ 20.24  Forfeited   (3.4 )  $ 18.19      December 26, 2009   105.4   $ 17.03  Granted   32.4   $ 22.56  Vested   (34.6 )  $ 17.70  Forfeited   (3.4 )  $ 17.98      December 25, 2010   99.8   $ 18.56  Granted   43.3   $ 19.86  Assumed in acquisition   5.8   $ 20.80  Vested   (37.5 )  $ 18.60  Forfeited   (4.4 )  $ 19.07      December 31, 2011   107.0   $ 19.18      Expected to vest as of December 31, 2011   101.0   $ 19.16      ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START 82 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  The aggregate fair value of awards that vested in 2011 was $753 million ($808 million in 2010 and $320 million in 2009), which represents the market value of Intel common stock on the date that the restricted stock units vested. The grant date fair value of awards that vested in 2011 was $697 million ($612 million in 2010 and $407 million in 2009). The number of restricted stock units vested includes shares that we withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. Restricted stock units that are expected to vest are net of estimated future forfeitures. As of December 31, 2011, there was $1.3 billion in unrecognized compensation costs related to restricted stock units granted under our equity incentive plans. We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of 1.2 years.

Option exercise prices for options exercised during the three-year period ended December 31, 2011 ranged from $0.05 to $24.54. Stock Purchase Plan Approximately 70% of our employees were participating in our stock purchase plan as of December 31, 2011. Employees purchased 18.5 million shares in 2011 for $318 million under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan (17.2 million shares for $281 million in 2010 and 30.9 million shares for $344 million in 2009). As of December 31, 2011, there was $13 million in unrecognized compensation costs related to rights to acquire common stock under our stock purchase plan. We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately one and a half months. Note 25: Common Stock Repurchases Common Stock Repurchase Program We have an ongoing authorization, since October 2005, as amended, from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $45 billion in shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. This amount includes $20 billion of increases in the authorization limit approved by our Board of Directors in 2011. As of December 31, 2011, $10.1 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit. During 2011, we repurchased 642.3 million shares of common stock at a cost of $14.1 billion. During 2010, we repurchased 70.3 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1.5 billion. We utilized the majority of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2009 debentures to repurchase 88.2 million shares at a cost of $1.7 billion during 2009 (for further information on the issuance of the 2009 debentures, see Note 21: Borrowings). We have repurchased 4.1 billion shares at a cost of $84 billion since the program began in 1990. Restricted Stock Unit Withholdings We issue restricted stock units as part of our equity incentive plans. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. During 2011, we withheld 10.3 million shares (10.1 million shares during 2010 and 5.8 million shares during 2009) to satisfy $207 million ($236 million during 2010 and $92 million during 2009) of employees tax obligations. Although shares withheld are not issued, they are treated as common stock repurchases in our consolidated financial statements, as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting.  ##TABLE_START 84 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Note 26: Earnings Per Share We computed our basic and diluted earnings per common share as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  2011   2010   2009  Net income available to common stockholders  $ 12,942   $ 11,464   $ 4,369  Weighted average common shares outstandingbasic   5,256    5,555    5,557  Dilutive effect of employee equity incentive plans   101    89    37  Dilutive effect of convertible debt   54    52    51         Weighted average common shares outstandingdiluted   5,411    5,696    5,645         Basic earnings per common share  $ 2.46   $ 2.06   $ 0.79         Diluted earnings per common share  $ 2.39   $ 2.01   $ 0.77         ##TABLE_END  We computed our basic earnings per common share using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We computed diluted earnings per common share using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Net income available to participating securities was insignificant for all periods presented. Potentially dilutive common shares from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan. Potentially dilutive common shares are determined by applying the if-converted method for the 2005 debentures. However, as our 2009 debentures require settlement of the principal amount of the debt in cash upon conversion, with the conversion premium paid in cash or stock at our option, potentially dilutive common shares for the 2009 debentures are determined by applying the treasury stock method. For further discussion on the specific conversion features of our 2005 and 2009 debentures, see Note 21: Borrowings. For 2011, we excluded 90 million outstanding weighted average stock options (161 million in 2010 and 486 million in 2009) from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the exercise prices of these stock options were greater than or equal to the average market value of the common shares. These options could be included in the calculation in the future if the average market value of the common shares increases and is greater than the exercise price of the options. In 2011, we included our 2009 debentures in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the average market price was above the conversion price. In 2010 and 2009, we excluded the 2009 debentures from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the conversion option of the debentures was anti-dilutive, and we could potentially exclude the 2009 debentures again in the future if the average market price is below the conversion price.  ##TABLE_START 85 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Note 27: Comprehensive Income The components of total comprehensive income were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010   2009  Net income  $ 12,942   $ 11,464   $ 4,369  Other comprehensive income (loss)   (1,114 )   (60 )   786         Total comprehensive income  $ 11,828   $ 11,404   $ 5,155         ##TABLE_END The components of other comprehensive income (loss) and related tax effects were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000    2011   2010   2009  (In Millions)  Before Tax   Tax   Net of Tax   Before Tax   Tax   Net of Tax   Before Tax   Tax   Net of Tax  Change in unrealized holding gain (loss) on investments  $ 35   $ (13 )  $ 22   $ 311   $ (111 )  $ 200   $ 578   $ (210 )  $ 368  Less: adjustment for (gain) loss on investments included in net income   (299 )   107    (192 )   (94 )   34    (60 )   50    (18 )   32  Change in deferred tax asset valuation allowance                   72    72        152    152  Less: adjustment for (gain) loss on deferred tax asset valuation allowance included in net income       (99 )   (99 )       (15 )   (15 )       (6 )   (6 ) Change in unrealized holding gain (loss) on derivatives   20    (16 )   4    73    (23 )   50    75    (4 )   71  Less: adjustment for amortization of (gain) loss on derivatives   (161 )   38    (123 )   (80 )   17    (63 )   22    (1 )   21  Change in prior service costs               (67 )   24    (43 )   21    (7 )   14  Less: adjustment for amortization of prior service costs   7    (3 )   4    7    (3 )   4    (1 )       (1 ) Change in actuarial loss   (900 )   284    (616 )   (300 )   81    (219 )   132    (15 )   117  Less: adjustment for amortization of actuarial loss   43    (15 )   28    22    (8 )   14    26    (8 )   18  Change in net foreign currency translation adjustment   (155 )   13    (142 )                                            Total other comprehensive income (loss)  $ (1,410 )  $ 296   $ (1,114 )  $ (128 )  $ 68   $ (60 )  $ 903   $ (117 )  $ 786                     ##TABLE_END The change in deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the preceding table is related to the reversal of a portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance attributed to changes in unrealized holding gains on our available-for-sale investments.

These full tax exemptions expire at various dates through 2020; however, the exemptions in certain countries are eligible for renewal. In 2011, the tax benefit attributable to tax holidays was $554 million with a $0.10 impact on diluted earnings per share. The tax holiday benefits for 2010 and 2009 were $256 million ($0.04 per diluted share) and $115 million ($0.02 per diluted share), respectively. During 2011, net income tax deficiencies attributable to equity-based compensation transactions that were allocated to stockholders equity totaled $18 million (net benefits of $40 million in 2010 and net deficiencies of $41 million in 2009).  ##TABLE_START 87 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at year-ends were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010  Deferred tax assets   Accrued compensation and other benefits  $ 1,016   $ 675  Share-based compensation   732    782  Deferred income   616    240  Inventory   613    95  Unrealized losses on investments and derivatives   293    375  State credits and net operating losses   230    158  Other, net   756    544       Gross deferred tax assets   4,256    2,869  Valuation allowance   (373 )   (252 )      Total deferred tax assets  $ 3,883   $ 2,617       Deferred tax liabilities   Property, plant and equipment  $ (2,329 )  $ (564 ) Licenses and intangibles   (915 )   (135 ) Convertible debt   (799 )   (740 ) Investment in foreign subsidiaries   (214 )   (52 ) Other, net   (208 )   (275 )      Total deferred tax liabilities  $ (4,465 )  $ (1,766 )      Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)  $ (582 )  $ 851       Reported as:   Current deferred tax assets  $ 1,700   $ 1,488  Non-current deferred tax assets   335    289  Non-current deferred tax liabilities   (2,617 )   (926 )      Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)  $ (582 )  $ 851       ##TABLE_END  Non-current deferred tax assets are included within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The valuation allowance is based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. The valuation allowance as of December 31, 2011 included allowances related to unrealized state credit carryforwards of $215 million and matters related to our non-U.S. subsidiaries of $158 million. As of December 31, 2011, our federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $317 million, $320 million, and $793 million, respectively. The majority of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The remaining foreign as well as the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2032. A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. relates to acquisitions and, as a result, is limited in the amount that can be recognized in any one year. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards include $491 million that is not likely to be recovered and has been reduced by a valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2011, we had not recognized U.S. deferred income taxes on a cumulative total of $14.2 billion of undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and $2.8 billion of other basis differences of our investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries primarily related to McAfee. Determining the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to investments in these non-U.S. subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested is not practicable. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest those earnings and other basis differences in operations outside the U.S. Long-term income taxes payable of $165 million as of December 31, 2011 ($190 million as of December 25, 2010), within other long-term liabilities, includes uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and non-U.S. tax credits, and may also include other long-term tax liabilities that are not uncertain but have not yet been paid.  ##TABLE_START 88 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010   2009  Beginning gross unrecognized tax benefits  $ 216   $ 220   $ 744  Settlements and effective settlements with tax authorities and related remeasurements   (63 )   (73 )   (526 ) Lapse of statute of limitations   (17 )         Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods   91    28    28  Decreases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods   (21 )   (30 )   (58 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during current period   6    71    32         Ending gross unrecognized tax benefits  $ 212   $ 216   $ 220         ##TABLE_END  During 2011, we settled and effectively settled matters with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and certain state tax authorities related to tax positions taken during prior periods. The result of the settlements, effective settlements, and resulting remeasurements was a reduction of $63 million in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits ($73 million in 2010, $526 million in 2009), $61 million of which resulted in a tax benefit for 2011 ($48 million for 2010, $366 million for 2009). If the remaining balance of $212 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2011 ($216 million as of December 25, 2010) were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $92 million and a reduction in the effective tax rate ($124 million as of December 25, 2010). During all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of income. In 2011, we recognized an expense of $24 million, primarily due to the accrual of interest and penalties related to foreign unrecognized tax benefits. In 2009, we recognized a net benefit of $62 million, primarily due to the reversal of accrued interest and penalties related to settled and effectively settled matters described above (insignificant for 2010). As of December 31, 2011, we had $90 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits ($49 million as of December 25, 2010). Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure on audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. However, given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. We file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and non-U.S. tax returns. For U.S. state and non-U.S. tax returns, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2001. For U.S. federal tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2008. Note 29: Contingencies Legal Proceedings We are currently a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted in this section. While management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm the companys financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages, and in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of IP. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. It is also possible that we could conclude it is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers to settle one or more such matters, and any such settlement could include substantial payments; however, we have not reached this conclusion with respect to any particular matter at this time. A number of proceedings generally have challenged and continue to challenge certain of our competitive practices. The allegations in these proceedings vary and are described in more detail in the following paragraphs, but in general contend that we improperly condition price rebates and other discounts on our microprocessors on exclusive or near-exclusive dealing by some of our customers; claim that our software compiler business unfairly prefers Intel microprocessors over competing microprocessors and that, through the use of our compiler and other means, we have caused inaccurate and misleading benchmark results concerning our microprocessors to be disseminated; allege that we unfairly controlled the content and timing of release of various standard computer interfaces developed by Intel in cooperation with other industry participants; and accuse us of engaging in various acts of improper competitive activity in  ##TABLE_START 89 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  competing against what is referred to as general-purpose graphics processing units, including certain licensing practices and our actions in connection with developing and disclosing potentially competitive technology. We believe that we compete lawfully and that our marketing, business, IP, and other challenged practices benefit our customers and our stockholders, and we will continue to conduct a vigorous defense in these proceedings. While we have settled some of these matters, the distractions caused by challenges to our conduct from the remaining matters are undesirable, and the legal and other costs associated with defending and resolving our position have been and continue to be significant. We assume that these challenges could continue for a number of years and may require the investment of substantial additional management time and substantial financial resources to explain and defend our position. Government Competition Matters and Related Consumer Class Actions In 2001, the European Commission (EC) commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy our microprocessors. We have received numerous requests for information and documents from the EC, and we have responded to each of those requests. The EC issued a Statement of Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. In May 2009, the EC issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged conditional rebates and payments that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged payments to prevent sales of specific rival products. The EC imposed a fine in the amount of  1.06 billion ($1.447 billion as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and also ordered us to immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in the EC decision. In the second quarter of 2009, we recorded the related charge within marketing, general and administrative. We strongly disagree with the ECs decision, and we appealed the decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The EC filed an answer to our reply brief in November 2010. The courts decision, after oral argument, is expected in late 2012 or early 2013. The EC decision exceeds 500 pages and does not contain specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision states that we should cease and desist from further conduct that, in the ECs opinion, would violate applicable law. We have taken steps, which are subject to the ECs ongoing review, to comply with that decision pending appeal. We opened discussions with the EC to better understand the decision and to explain changes to our business practices. Based on our current understanding and expectations, we do not believe that any such changes will be material to our financial position, results, or cash flows. In June 2005, we received an inquiry from the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) requesting documents from our Korean subsidiary related to marketing and rebate programs that we entered into with Korean PC manufacturers. In February 2006, the KFTC initiated an inspection of documents at our offices in Korea. In September 2007, the KFTC served on us an Examination Report alleging that sales to two customers during parts of 20022005 violated Koreas Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act. In December 2007, we submitted our written response to the KFTC. In February 2008, the KFTCs examiner submitted a written reply to our response. In March 2008, we submitted a further response. In April 2008, we participated in a pre-hearing conference before the KFTC, and we participated in formal hearings in May and June 2008. In June 2008, the KFTC announced its intent to fine us approximately $25 million for providing discounts to Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and TriGem Computer Inc. In November 2008, the KFTC issued a final written decision concluding that our discounts had violated Korean antitrust law and imposing a fine on us of approximately $20 million, which we paid in January 2009. In December 2008, we appealed this decision by filing a lawsuit in the Seoul High Court seeking to overturn the KFTCs decision. We expect a decision from the court in 2012. In November 2009, the State of New York filed a lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The lawsuit alleged that we violated federal antitrust laws; the New York Donnelly Act, which prohibits contracts or agreements to monopolize; and the New York Executive Law, which proscribes underlying violations of federal and state antitrust laws. The lawsuit alleged that we engaged in a systematic worldwide campaign of illegal, exclusionary conduct to maintain monopoly power and prices in the market for x86 microprocessors through the use of various alleged actions, including exclusive or near-exclusive agreements from large computer makers in exchange for loyalty payments and bribes, and other alleged threats and retaliation. New York claimed that our alleged actions harmed New York consumers, competition, and innovation. The complaint sought a declaration that our alleged actions violated federal and New York antitrust laws and New York Executive Law; an injunction to prevent further alleged unlawful acts; damages in an amount to be proven at trial based on alleged overcharges on purchases of computers containing Intel microprocessors by New York state agencies and non-state entities, as well as by individual New York consumers, trebled as provided for by law under the Sherman  ##TABLE_START 90 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Act or Donnelly Act, restitution, and disgorgement; $1 million in civil penalties for alleged violations of the Donnelly Act; and attorneys fees and costs. We disagreed with the State of New Yorks allegations and claims, and noted that we intended to conduct a vigorous defense of the lawsuit. We filed our answer in January 2010. In December 2010, the State of New York requested the courts permission to amend its complaint to expand the scope of parties covered by its Donnelly Act and Executive Law claims to include small and medium businesses operating within the state of New York. We opposed that request, and in May 2011, the court denied the State of New York permission to amend its complaint. In May 2011, we filed three motions: the first seeking partial summary judgment on any claims for damages under the Sherman Act based on purchases of computers containing Intel microprocessors not made within four years of the filing of the complaint, and any claims for damages under the Donnelly Act and Executive Law based on purchases not made within three years of the filing of the complaint; the second seeking dismissal of all claims brought on behalf of non-State of New York public entities on the ground that the State of New York did not obtain proper requests to represent them; and the third seeking judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the State of New York could not recover damages on behalf of New York consumers for certain claims. The court granted each of these motions in December 2011. These rulings greatly reduced the scope of the New York Attorney Generals lawsuit. In addition, in October 2011, we filed two other motions for summary judgment and a motion seeking to exclude the opinions and testimony of New Yorks economic expert. We sought summary judgment on the grounds that each of New Yorks claims lacked legal merit because our discounted prices challenged in the lawsuit were lawful and that New York could not establish antitrust injury because, among other things, it had no evidence of any harm to competition from our alleged actions. In February 2012, we announced a settlement of the lawsuit. The agreement, which followed the courts December 2011 rulings in Intels favor, expressly states that Intel does not admit either any violation of law or that the allegations in the complaint are true, and it calls for no changes to the way Intel does business. The agreement includes a payment of $6.5 million from Intel that is intended only to cover some of the costs incurred by the State of New York in the litigation. New York agreed to dismiss its action with prejudice, close any pending investigations arising out of the allegations of the complaint and those previously investigated by the Federal Trade Commission, and provide a release of claims against Intel and a covenant not to sue. New York also agreed to seek and obtain separate releases from non-state entities that receive any portion of the settlement fund. At least 82 separate class actions have been filed in the U.S. District Courts for the Northern District of California, Southern District of California, District of Idaho, District of Nebraska, District of New Mexico, District of Maine, and District of Delaware, as well as in various California, Kansas, and Tennessee state courts. These actions generally repeat the allegations made in a now-settled lawsuit filed against Intel by AMD in June 2005 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (AMD litigation). Like the AMD litigation, these class-action suits allege that Intel engaged in various actions in violation of the Sherman Act and other laws by, among other things, providing discounts and rebates to our manufacturer and distributor customers conditioned on exclusive or near-exclusive dealings that allegedly unfairly interfered with AMDs ability to sell its microprocessors, interfering with certain AMD product launches, and interfering with AMDs participation in certain industry standards-setting groups. The class actions allege various consumer injuries, including that consumers in various states have been injured by paying higher prices for computers containing our microprocessors. We dispute the class-action claims and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. All of the federal class actions and the Kansas and Tennessee state court class actions have been transferred by the Multidistrict Litigation Panel to the U.S. District Court in Delaware for all pre-trial proceedings and discovery (MDL proceedings). The Delaware district court has appointed a Special Master to address issues in the MDL proceedings, as assigned by the court. In January 2010, the plaintiffs in the Delaware action filed a motion for sanctions for our alleged failure to preserve evidence. This motion largely copies a motion previously filed by AMD in the AMD litigation, which has settled. The plaintiffs in the MDL proceedings also moved for certification of a class of members who purchased certain PCs containing products sold by Intel. In July 2010, the Special Master issued a Report and Recommendation (Class Report) denying the motion to certify a class. The MDL plaintiffs filed objections to the Special Masters Class Report, and a hearing on these objections was held in March 2011. The Delaware district court has not yet ruled on those objections. All California class actions have been consolidated in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County. The plaintiffs in the California actions have moved for class certification, which we are in the process of opposing. At our request, the court in the California actions has agreed to delay ruling on this motion until after the Delaware district court rules on the similar motion in the MDL proceedings. Based on the procedural posture and the nature of the cases, including, but not limited to, the fact that the Special Masters Class Report is on review in the Delaware district court, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from these matters.  ##TABLE_START 91 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Lehman Matter In November 2009, representatives of the Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. (LOTC) bankruptcy estate advised us informally that the estate was considering a claim against us arising from a 2008 contract between Intel and LOTC. Under the terms of the 2008 contract, Intel prepaid $1.0 billion to LOTC, in exchange for which LOTC was required to purchase and deliver to Intel the number of shares of Intel common stock that could be purchased for $1.0 billion at the discounted volume-weighted average price specified in the contract for the period September 2, 2008 to September 26, 2008. LOTCs performance under the contract was secured by $1.0 billion of cash collateral. Under the terms of the contract, LOTC was obligated to deliver approximately 50 million shares of our common stock to us on September 29, 2008. LOTC failed to deliver any shares of our common stock, and we exercised our right to setoff against the $1.0 billion collateral. LOTC has not initiated any action against us to date, but in February 2010, LOTC served a subpoena on us in connection with this transaction. In October 2010, LOTC demanded that Intel pay it at least $417 million. In September 2010, we entered into an agreement with LOTC that tolled any applicable statutes of limitations for 90 days and precluded the parties from commencing any formal proceedings to prosecute any claims against each other in any forum during that period. The tolling agreement with LOTC was extended several times, but lapsed in June 2011. We continue to believe that we acted appropriately under our agreement with LOTC, and we intend to defend any claim to the contrary. No complaint has been filed and we are in the early stages of evaluating this dispute, and accordingly are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from this matter. Frank T. Shum v. Intel Corporation, Jean-Marc Verdiell, and LightLogic, Inc. We acquired LightLogic, Inc. in May 2001. Frank Shum subsequently sued us, LightLogic, and LightLogics founder, Jean-Marc Verdiell, claiming that much of LightLogics IP is based on alleged inventions that Shum conceived while he and Verdiell were partners at Radiance Design, Inc. Shum has alleged claims for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent concealment, and breach of contract. Shum also seeks alleged correction of inventorship of seven patents acquired by us as part of the LightLogic acquisition. In January 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California denied Shums inventorship claim, and thereafter granted our motion for summary judgment on Shums remaining claims. In August 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the District Courts rulings and remanded the case for further proceedings. In October 2008, the District Court granted our motion for summary judgment on Shums claims for breach of fiduciary duty and fraudulent concealment, but denied our motion on Shums remaining claims. A jury trial on Shums remaining claims took place in November and December 2008. In pre-trial proceedings and at trial, Shum requested monetary damages against the defendants in amounts ranging from $31 million to $931 million, and his final request to the jury was for as much as $175 million. Following deliberations, the jury was unable to reach a verdict on most of the claims. With respect to Shums claim that he is the proper inventor on certain LightLogic patents now assigned to us, the jury agreed with Shum on some of those claims and was unable to reach a verdict regarding the remaining claims. In April 2009, the court granted defendants motions for judgment as a matter of law. Shum appealed that ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which heard oral arguments in August 2010 and affirmed the trial courts orders in favor of Intel in December 2010. In January 2011, Shum petitioned the Federal Circuit for a re-hearing and re-hearing en banc. In February 2011, the Federal Circuit denied Shums request. Shum petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for review in May 2011, and we filed our response in August 2011. The U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari in October 2011, ending the matter. Note 30: Operating Segment and Geographic Information Our operating segments in effect as of December 31, 2011 include: ##TABLE_START   PC Client Group ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Data Center Group ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Intel Mobile Communications ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Intelligent Systems Group ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Netbook and Tablet Group ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Ultra-Mobility Group ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   McAfee ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Wind River Software Group ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Software and Services Group ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group ##TABLE_END In the first quarter of 2011, we formed the Netbook and Tablet Group, which includes platforms designed for the netbook and tablet market segments, and we divested the Digital Health Group (for further information see Note 15: Divestitures). In the fourth quarter of 2011, we combined the Digital Home Group within the Netbook and Tablet Group. Prior-period amounts have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect these operating segment changes as well as other minor reorganizations. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2011, we formed the Intel Mobile Communications and McAfee operating segments as a result of acquisitions (for further information see Note 14: Acquisitions). The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our President and CEO. The CODM allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about its revenue and operating income (loss).  ##TABLE_START 92 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Our PC Client Group and our Data Center Group are reportable operating segments. We also aggregate and disclose the financial results of the following non-reportable operating segments: Intel Mobile Communications, Intelligent Systems Group (formerly known as the Embedded and Communications Group), Netbook and Tablet Group, and Ultra-Mobility Group. We also aggregate and disclose the financial results of the following non-reportable operating segments within software and services operating segments: McAfee, Wind River Software Group, and Software and Services Group. Each of these aggregated operating segments does not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the aggregation of these non-reportable operating segments. Revenue for our reportable and aggregated non-reportable operating segments is primarily related to the following product lines: ##TABLE_START   PC Client Group . Includes platforms designed for the notebook and desktop (including high-end enthusiast PCs) market segments; and wireless connectivity products. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Data Center Group. Includes platforms designed for the server, workstation, and storage computing market segments; and wired network connectivity products. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Other Intel architecture operating segments. Includes mobile phone components such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers, and power management chips; platforms designed for embedded applications; platforms for the netbook and tablet market segments; and products designed for the smartphone market segment. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Software and services operating segments. Includes software products for endpoint security, network and content security, risk and compliance, and consumer and mobile security from our McAfee business; software optimized products for the embedded and mobile market segments; and software products and services that ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   promote Intel  architecture as the platform of choice for software development. ##TABLE_END We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments, and the expenses are included in the operating results reported below. During 2009, we incurred charges of $1.447 billion as a result of the fine from the EC and $1.25 billion as a result of our legal settlement with AMD. These charges were included in the All other category. Additionally, the All other category includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as: ##TABLE_START   results of operations from our Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group that includes NAND flash memory products for use in a variety of devices; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   a portion of profit-dependent compensation and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   divested businesses for which discrete operating results are not reviewed by our CODM; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   results of operations of seed businesses that support our initiatives; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. ##TABLE_END The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Except as discussed above, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole. Net revenue and operating income (loss) for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: ##TABLE_START 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions)  2011   2010   2009  Net revenue    PC Client Group  $ 35,406   $ 30,327   $ 24,894  Data Center Group   10,129    8,693    6,450  Other Intel architecture operating segments   5,005    3,055    2,683  Software and services operating segments   1,870    264    115  All other   1,589    1,284    985         Total net revenue  $ 53,999   $ 43,623   $ 35,127         Operating income (loss)    PC Client Group  $ 14,793   $ 12,971   $ 7,441  Data Center Group   5,100    4,388    2,289  Other Intel architecture operating segments   (577 )   270    (45 ) Software and services operating segments   (32 )   (175 )   (100 ) All other   (1,807 )   (1,866 )   (3,874 )        Total operating income  $ 17,477   $ 15,588   $ 5,711         ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START 93 ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  In 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company accounted for 19% of our net revenue (21% in 2010 and 2009), and Dell Inc. accounted for 15% of our net revenue (17% in 2010 and 2009).

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Part IV, Item 15. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Intel Corporation at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Intel Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. San Jose, California February 23, 2012  ##TABLE_START 95 ##TABLE_END REPORT OF ERNST  YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intel Corporation We have audited Intel Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Intel Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Intel Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2011 consolidated financial statements of Intel Corporation and our report dated February 23, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on managements evaluation (with the participation of our CEO and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Managements assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. Based on our assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst  Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their attestation report, which is included at the end of Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END Company Overview We design and manufacture advanced integrated digital technology platforms. A platform consists of a microprocessor and chipset, and may be enhanced by additional hardware, software, and services. We sell these platforms primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs), and industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries. Our platforms are used in a wide range of applications, such as PCs (including Ultrabook  , detachable, and convertible systems), servers, tablets, smartphones, automobiles, automated factory systems, and medical devices. We also develop and sell software and services primarily focused on security and technology integration. We were incorporated in California in 1968 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1989. Company Strategy Our goal is to be the preeminent computing solutions company that powers the worldwide digital economy. Over time the number of devices connected to the Internet and each other has grown from hundreds of millions to billions, and the variety of devices also continues to increase. The combination of the proliferation of mobile devices connecting to the Internet and a build-out of the cloud infrastructure that supports these devices is driving fundamental changes in the computing industry. As a result, we are transforming our primary focus from the design and manufacture of semiconductor chips for PCs and servers to the delivery of solutions consisting of hardware and software platforms and supporting services across a wide range of computing devices. Examples of these solutions can be seen across the computing continuum, from the teraflops of operations per second for high performance computing (HPC) to the milliwatts of energy-consumed by an embedded application. Additionally, computing is becoming an increasingly engaging, mobile, and personal experience. End users value consistency across devices that connect seamlessly and securely to the Internet and to each other. We enable this experience by innovating around energy-efficient performance, connectivity, and security. To succeed in this changing computing environment, we have the following key objectives: ##TABLE_START   strive to ensure that Intel  technology remains the best choice for the PC as well as cloud computing and the data center; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   maximize and extend our manufacturing technology leadership; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   expand platforms into adjacent market segments to bring compelling new System-on-Chip (SoC) solutions and user experiences to mobile form factors including smartphones and tablets, as well as embedded and microserver applications; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   develop platforms that enable devices that connect to the Internet and to each other to create a continuum of personal user and computing experiences thereby offering consumers a set of secure, consistent, engaging, and personalized computing experiences; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   positively impact the world through our actions and the application of our energy-efficient technology. ##TABLE_END We use our core assets to meet these objectives. Our core assets include our silicon and process technology, our architecture and platforms, our global presence, our strong relationships across the industry, and our brand recognition. We believe that applying these core assets to our key focus areas provides us with the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers needs quickly. Our core assets and key focus areas include the following: ##TABLE_START   Silicon and Manufacturing Technology Leadership. We have long been a leader in silicon process technology and manufacturing, and we aim to continue our lead through investment and innovation in this critical area. We drive a regular two-year upgrade cycleintroducing a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramping the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. We refer to this as our tick-tock technology development cadence. With our continued focus on silicon and manufacturing technology leadership, we entered into a series of agreements during the third quarter of 2012 with ASML Holding N.V. These agreements are intended to accelerate the development of 450-millimeter (450mm) wafer technology and extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). We expect larger silicon wafers and enhanced lithography technologies with EUV to allow Moores Law to continue. Moores Law predicted that transistor density on integrated circuits would double about every two years. As part of these agreements, we made a $3.2 billion equity investment in ASML during 2012. We aim to have the best process technology, and unlike many semiconductor companies, we primarily manufacture our products in our own facilities. This in-house manufacturing capability allows us to optimize performance, shorten our time to market, and scale new products more rapidly. We believe this competitive advantage will be extended in the future as the costs to build leading-edge fabrication facilities increase, and as fewer semiconductor companies will be able to combine platform design and manufacturing. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Architecture and Platforms. We are developing a wide range of solutions for devices that span the computing continuum and allow for computing experiences from PCs (including Ultrabook , detachable, and convertible systems), tablets, and smartphones to in-vehicle infotainment systems and beyond. We believe that users want consistent computing experiences and interoperable devices and that users and developers value consistency of architecture, which provides a common framework that allows for shortened time to market, with the ability to leverage technologies across multiple form factors. We believe that we can meet the needs of users and developers to offer computing solutions across the computing continuum through our partnership with the industry on open, standards-based platform innovation around Intel  architecture. We continue to invest in improving Intel architecture to deliver increased value to our customers and expand the capabilities of the architecture in adjacent market segments. For example, we focus on delivering improved energy-efficient performance, which involves balancing higher performance with lower power consumption. In addition, we are focusing on perceptual computing, which brings exciting user experiences through devices that sense and perceive the users actions. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Software and Services. We offer software and services that provide security solutions through a combination of hardware and software for consumer, mobile, and corporate environments designed to protect systems from malicious virus attacks as well as loss of data. Additionally, we seek to enable and advance the computing ecosystem by providing development tools and support to help software developers create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platforms. We seek to expedite growth in various market segments, such as the embedded market segment, through our software offerings. We continue to collaborate with companies to develop software platforms optimized for our Intel processors and that support multiple hardware architectures and operating systems. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Customer Orientation. Our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of products based on the needs and expectations of our customers. In turn, our products help enable the design and development of new user experiences, form factors, and usage models for businesses and consumers. We offer platforms that ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   incorporate various components and capabilities designed and configured to work together to provide an optimized solution that customers can easily integrate in their end products. Additionally, we promote industry standards that we believe will yield innovation and improved technologies for users. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Strategic Investments. We make investments in companies around the world that we believe will further our strategic objectives, support our key business initiatives, and generate financial returns. Our investmentsincluding those made through our Intel Capital programgenerally focus on investing in companies and initiatives that we believe will stimulate growth in the digital economy, create new business opportunities for Intel, and expand global markets for our products. Additionally, we plan to continue to purchase and license intellectual property to support our current and expanding business. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Stewardship. We are committed to developing energy-efficient technology solutions that can be used to address major global problems while reducing our environmental impact. We are also committed to helping transform education globally through our technology, program, and policy leadership, as well as through funding by means of the Intel Foundation. In addition, we strive to cultivate a work environment in which engaged, energized employees can thrive in their jobs and in their communities. ##TABLE_END Our continued investment in developing our assets and execution in key focus areas is intended to help strengthen our competitive position as we enter and expand into adjacent market segments, such as smartphones and tablets. These market segments change rapidly, and we need to adapt to this environment. A key characteristic of these adjacent market segments is low power consumption based on SoC products. We are making significant investments in this area with the accelerated development of our SoC solutions based on the Intel  Atom  microarchitecture. Additionally, we are building mobile reference designs to help the adoption of Intel architecture in these adjacent market segments. Examples include our smartphone reference designs, which were launched by multiple global partners in 2012. We also believe that increased Internet traffic and the increased use of mobile and cloud computing create a need for an improved server infrastructure, including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance.  Business Organization As of December 29, 2012, we managed our business through the following operating segments:  For a description of our operating segments, see Note 28: Operating Segment and Geographic Information, in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Products Platforms We offer platforms that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, or stand-alone SoC. Additionally, a platform may be enhanced by additional hardware, software, and services. A microprocessorthe central processing unit (CPU) of a computer systemprocesses system data and controls other devices in the system. We offer microprocessors with one or multiple processor cores. Multi-core microprocessors can enable improved multitasking and energy-efficient performance by distributing computing tasks across two or more cores. Our 2nd, 3rd, and expected-to-be-released 4th generation Intel  Core  (formerly code-named Haswell) processor families integrate graphics functionality onto the processor die. In contrast, some of our previous-generation processors incorporated a separate graphics chip inside the processor package. We also offer graphics functionality as part of a separate chipset outside the processor package. Processor packages may also integrate a memory controller. A chipset sends data between the microprocessor and input, display, and storage devices, such as the keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard drive or solid-state drive, and optical disc drives. Chipsets extend the audio, video, and other capabilities of many systems and perform essential logic functions, such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks. Some chipsets may also include graphics functionality or a memory controller, for use with our microprocessors that do not integrate those system components. We offer and continue to develop SoC products that integrate our core processing functions with other system components, such as graphics, audio, and video, onto a single chip. SoC products are designed to reduce total cost of ownership, provide improved performance due to higher integration and lower power consumption, and enable smaller form factors such as smartphones and tablets. We also offer features designed to improve our platform capabilities. For example, we offer Intel  vPro  technology, a computer hardware-based security technology for the notebook and desktop market segments. This technology is designed to provide businesses with increased manageability, upgradeability, energy-efficient performance, and security while lowering the total cost of ownership.  We offer a range of platforms based upon the following microprocessors:  McAfee In 2011, we acquired McAfee, Inc. with the objective of improving the overall security of our platforms. McAfee offers software products that provide security solutions designed to protect systems in consumer, mobile, and corporate environments from malicious virus attacks as well as loss of data. McAfees products include software solutions for end-point security, network and content security, risk and compliance, and consumer and mobile security. Phone Components In addition to our Intel Atom processor-based products for the smartphone market segment, we offer components and platforms for mobile phones and connected devices. Our acquisition of the Wireless Solutions (WLS) business of Infineon Technologies AG in 2011 has enabled us to offer a variety of mobile phone components, including baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers, and power management integrated circuits. We also offer comprehensive mobile phone platforms, including Bluetooth* wireless technology and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) receivers, software solutions, customization, and essential interoperability tests. Our mobile phone solutions based on multiple industry standards help enable mobile voice and high-speed data communications for a broad range of devices around the world. Non-Volatile Memory Solutions We offer NAND flash memory products primarily used in solid-state drives (SSDs). Our NAND flash memory products are manufactured by IM Flash Technologies, LLC (IMFT).  Products and Product Strategy by Operating Segment Our PC Client Group operating segment offers products that are incorporated in notebook (including Ultrabook , detachable, and convertible systems) and desktop computers for consumers and businesses. In 2012 we introduced the 3rd generation Intel  Core  processor family for use in notebook and desktop computers. These processors use 22-nanometer (nm) transistors and our Tri-Gate transistor processor technology. Our Tri-Gate transistor technology extends Moores Law and is the worlds first 3-D Tri-Gate transistor on a production technology. These enhancements in combination can provide significant power savings and performance gains when compared to previous-generation technologies. Notebook Our strategy for the notebook computing market segment is to offer notebook PC technologies designed to improve performance, battery life, wireless connectivity, manageability and security, as well as to allow for the design of smaller, lighter, and thinner form factors. Additionally, we are collaborating with others in the industry to integrate a touch-based interface and recognition features based on voice and gesture. In 2013, we expect to introduce our 4th generation Intel  Core  processor family. We believe these processors will continue to deliver increasing levels of graphics performance and provide OEMs and end users with more choice in selecting processors with more processor cores, graphics performance, or both. In addition to offering notebook PC technologies, we have worked with our customers to help them develop a new class of personal computing devices that includes Ultrabook, detachable, and convertible systems. These computers combine the energy-efficient performance and capabilities of todays notebooks and tablets with enhanced graphics and perceptual computing features in a thin, light, and customizable form factor that is highly responsive and secure, and that can seamlessly connect to the Internet and other enabled devices. We believe the renewed innovation in the PC industry that we fostered with Ultrabook systems and expanded to other thin and light form factors will continue to blur the lines between tablets and notebooks so a consumer does not have to choose between the two. Desktop Our strategy for the desktop computing market segment is to offer products that provide increased manageability, security, and energy-efficient performance while lowering total cost of ownership for businesses. The desktop computing market segment includes all-in-one desktop products, which combine traditionally separate desktop components into one form factor. Additionally, all-in-one computers have transformed into adaptable and flexible form factors that offer users increased customization and ease of use. For desktop consumers, we also focus on the design of products for high-end enthusiast PCs and mainstream PCs with rich audio and video capabilities. Our Data Center Group operating segment offers products designed to provide leading performance, energy efficiency, and virtualization technology for server, workstation, and storage platforms. We are also increasing our focus on products designed for high-performance computing, mission-critical computing, and cloud computing services. The cloud computing market segment refers to servers and other products that enable on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable software, services, and computing devices. Such products include the introduction in 2012 of our many-core Intel  Xeon Phi  coprocessor with 60 or more high-performance, low-power Intel processor cores, as well as our server platform that incorporates our 32nm Intel  Xeon  processors supporting as many as 10 cores for server platforms. The Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors are positioned to boost the power of the worlds most advanced supercomputers, allowing for trillions of calculations per second, while the 32nm Intel Xeon processors provide faster throughput for cloud computing-based services. In the data storage market segment, we introduced 64-bit Intel Atom microarchitecture-based SoC solutions to focus on the emerging market for highly dense, low-power server configurations. These products allow server rack space optimization and reduced energy costs with microservers that require less than 10 watts per server node. Our other Intel architecture operating segments offer products designed to be used in the mobile communications, embedded, netbook, tablet, and smartphone market segments. ##TABLE_START   Our strategy for the mobile communications market segment, addressed by our Intel Mobile Communications (IMC) group, is to offer a portfolio of phone components that covers a broad range of wireless connectivity options by combining Intel  WiFi technology with our 2G and 3G technologies, while continuing our efforts to accelerate industry adoption of 4G LTE. These products feature low power consumption, innovative designs, and multi-standard platform solutions. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our strategy for the embedded market segment, addressed by our Intelligent Systems Group (ISG), is to drive Intel architecture as a solution for embedded applications by delivering long life-cycle support, software and architectural scalability, and platform integration. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our strategy for the tablet market segment is to offer Intel architecture solutions optimized for multiple operating systems and application ecosystems, such as our recent introduction of a platform for tablets that incorporates the Intel Atom processor. We are accelerating the process technology development for our Intel Atom processor product line to deliver increased battery life, performance, and feature integration. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Our strategy for the smartphone device market segment is to offer Intel Atom microarchitecture-based products that enable smartphones to deliver innovative content and services. Such products include the introduction of a new platform for smartphones that incorporates the Intel Atom processor, which is designed to deliver increased performance and system responsiveness while also enabling longer battery life. Additionally, we engage with and enable the supplier ecosystem by providing ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   reference designs that showcase the advantages of Intel architecture in smartphone devices. ##TABLE_END Our software and services operating segments seek to create differentiated user experiences on Intel-based platforms. We differentiate by combining Intel platform features and enhanced software and services. Our three primary initiatives are: ##TABLE_START   enabling platforms that can be used across multiple ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   operating systems, applications, and services across all Intel products; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   optimizing features and performance by enabling the software ecosystem to quickly take advantage of new platform features and capabilities; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   delivering comprehensive solutions by using software, services, and hardware to enable a more secure online experience, such as our McAfee DeepSAFE* technology platform, which provides additional security below the operating system of the platform. ##TABLE_ENDRevenue by Major Operating Segment Net revenue for the PC Client Group (PCCG) operating segment, the Data Center Group (DCG) operating segment, the other Intel architecture (Other IA) operating segments, and the software and services (SSG) operating segments is presented as a percentage of our consolidated net revenue. Other IA includes IMC, ISG, the Netbook Group, the Tablet Group, the Phone Group, and the Service Provider Group operating segments. SSG includes McAfee, the Wind River Software Group, and the Software and Services Group operating segments. All Other consists primarily of revenue from the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group. Percentage of Revenue by Major Operating Segment (Dollars in Millions) Revenue from sales of platforms presented as a percentage of our consolidated net revenue was as follows: Percentage of Revenue by Principal Product from Reportable Segments (Dollars in Millions)  Competition The computing industry is evolving and as a result, so is our competitive landscape. Our platforms, based on Intel  architecture, are positioned to compete across the spectrum of Internet-connected computing devices, from the lowest-power portable devices to the most powerful data center servers. New competitors are joining traditional competitors in our core PC and server business areas where we are a leading provider, while we face incumbent competitors in the adjacent market segments that we are pursuing, such as smartphones and tablets. Competitors include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), International Business Machines (IBM), Oracle Corporation, as well as ARM* architecture licensees from ARM Limited, such as QUALCOMM Incorporated, NVIDIA Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and Texas Instruments Incorporated. The primary competitor for our McAfee family of security products and services is Symantec Corporation. We face emerging business model competitors from OEMs that choose to vertically integrate their own proprietary semiconductor and software assets to some degree, such as Apple Inc. and Samsung. In doing so, these OEMs may be attempting to offer greater differentiation in their products and increase their share of the profits for each finished product they sell. Unforeseen competitor acquisitions, collaborations or licensing scenarios (including injunctions or other litigation outcomes) could also have a significant impact on our competitive position. Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, innovative design, features, price, quality, reliability, brand recognition and availability. One of our important competitive advantages is the combination of our network of manufacturing, assembly and test facilities with our global architecture design teams. This network enables us to have more direct control over our processes, quality control, product cost, production timing, performance and manufacturing yield. The increased cost of constructing new fabrication facilities supporting smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers has led to a smaller pool of companies that can afford to build and equip leading-edge manufacturing facilities. Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries and subcontractors such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. or GlobalFoundries Inc. for their manufacturing and assembly and test needs, creating, among other risks, the potential for supply constraints and limited process technology differentiation between competitors using the same foundry. Manufacturing and Assembly and Test As of December 29, 2012, 56% of our wafer fabrication, including microprocessors and chipsets, was conducted within the U.S. at our facilities in New Mexico, Arizona, Oregon, and Massachusetts. The remaining 44% of our wafer fabrication was conducted outside the U.S. at our facilities in Ireland, China, and Israel. Wafer fabrication conducted within and outside the U.S. is impacted by the timing of a facilitys transition to a newer process technology, as well as a facilitys capacity utilization. As of December 29, 2012, we primarily manufactured our products in wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations: ##TABLE_START Products  Wafer Size  Process Technology  Locations Microprocessors  300mm  22nm  Israel, Arizona, Oregon Microprocessors  300mm  32nm  New Mexico Microprocessors  300mm  45nm  New Mexico Chipsets and microprocessors  300mm  65nm  China, Arizona, Ireland Other products and chipsets  300mm  90nm  Ireland Chipsets and microprocessors  200mm  130nm  Massachusetts ##TABLE_END  As of December 29, 2012, most of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers using our 22nm and 32nm process technology. As we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology, we incur significant start-up costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing. However, continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs. The benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor, reducing heat output from each transistor, and increasing the number of integrated features on each chip. These advancements can result in microprocessors that are higher performing, consume less power, and cost less to manufacture. In addition, with each shift to a new process technology, we are able to produce more microprocessors per square foot of our wafer fabrication facilities. The costs to develop our process technology are significantly less than adding capacity by building additional wafer fabrication facilities using older process technology.  We use third-party manufacturing companies (foundries) to manufacture wafers for certain components, including networking and communications products. In addition, we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture board-level products and systems, and smartphones. We purchase certain communications networking products and mobile phone components from external vendors primarily in the Asia-Pacific region. Following the manufacturing process, the majority of our components are subject to assembly and test. We perform our components assembly and test at facilities in Malaysia, China, Costa Rica, and Vietnam. To augment capacity, we use subcontractors to perform assembly of certain products, primarily chipsets and networking and communications products. In addition, we use subcontractors to perform assembly and test of our mobile phone components. Our NAND flash memory products are manufactured by IMFT and Micron Technology, Inc. using 20nm, 25nm, or 34nm process technology, and assembly and test of these products is performed by Micron and other external subcontractors. For further information, see Note 10: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our employment practices are consistent with, and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by, local country law. In addition, we impose a minimum employee age requirement as well as progressive Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) requirements, regardless of local law. We have thousands of suppliers, including subcontractors, providing our various materials and service needs. We set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments. We communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources, but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country. In those cases, we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply. We have entered into long-term contracts with certain suppliers to ensure a portion of our silicon supply. Our products are typically manufactured at multiple Intel facilities around the world or by subcontractors. However, some products are manufactured in only one Intel or subcontractor facility, and we seek to implement action plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Research and Development We are committed to investing in world-class technology development, particularly in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits. Research and development (RD) expenditures were $10.1 billion in 2012 ($8.4 billion in 2011 and $6.6 billion in 2010). Our RD activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products, which will in turn enable new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers. Our RD activities range from designing and developing new products and manufacturing processes to researching future technologies and products. As part of our RD efforts, we plan to introduce a new microarchitecture for our notebook, Ultrabook system, and Intel Xeon processors approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. We refer to this as our tick-tock technology development cadence as subsequently illustrated. In 2012, we started manufacturing products with our 4th generation Intel  Core  microarchitecture, a new microarchitecture using our existing 22nm three-dimensional Tri-Gate transistor process technology (22nm process technology). We are currently developing 14nm process technology, our next-generation process technology, and expect to begin manufacturing products using that technology in 2013. Our leadership in silicon technology has enabled us to make Moores Law a reality.   Our leadership in silicon technology has also helped expand on the advances anticipated by Moores Law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products optimized for a wider variety of applications. We have accelerated the Intel Atom processor-based SoC roadmap for smartphones, tablets, and other devices, from 32nm through 22nm to 14nm. We intend that Intel Atom processors will eventually be on the same process technology as our leading-edge products for both smartphones and tablets. We expect that this acceleration will result in a significant reduction in transistor leakage, lower active power, and an increase in transistor density to enable more powerful smartphones and tablets with more features and longer battery life. We focus our RD efforts on advanced computing technologies, developing new microarchitectures, advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology, delivering the next generation of microprocessors and chipsets, improving our platform initiatives, and developing software solutions and tools. Our RD efforts are intended to enable new levels of performance and address areas such as energy efficiency, security, scalability for multi-core architectures, system manageability, and ease of use. We continue to make significant RD investments in the development of SoCs to enable growth in areas such as smartphones, tablets, and embedded applications. For example, we continue to build smartphone and tablet reference designs to showcase the benefits of Intel architecture. In addition, we continue to make significant investments in wireless technologies, graphics, and HPC. Our RD model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies, leading standards initiatives, and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies, including joint pathfinding conducted between researchers at Intel Labs and our business groups. We centrally manage key cross-business group product initiatives to align and prioritize our RD activities across these groups. In addition, we may augment our RD activities by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar RD focus areas, as well as directly purchasing or licensing technology applicable to our RD initiatives. An example of augmenting our RD activities is the series of agreements we entered into in the third quarter of 2012 with ASML. These agreements, in which Intel purchased ASML securities and agreed to provide RD funding over five years, are intended to accelerate the development of 450mm wafer technology and EUV lithography. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2012 we entered into agreements with Micron to modify our joint venture relationship, extending Intel and Microns NAND joint development program and expanding it to include emerging memory technologies. For further information, see Note 6: Available-for-Sale Investments and Cash Equivalents and Note 10: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Employees As of December 29, 2012, we had 105,000 employees worldwide (100,100 as of December 31, 2011), with approximately 51% of those employees located in the U.S. (52% as of December 31, 2011).  Sales and Marketing Customers We sell our products primarily to OEMs and ODMs. ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, we sell our products to other manufacturers, including makers of a wide range of industrial and communications equipment. Our customers also include those who buy PC components and our other products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customerssystems builders that purchase Intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors. We have a boxed processor program that allows distributors to sell our microprocessors in small quantities to these systems-builder customers; boxed processors are also available in direct retail outlets. In 2012, Hewlett-Packard Company accounted for 18% of our net revenue (19% in 2011 and 21% in 2010), Dell Inc. accounted for 14% of our net revenue (15% in 2011 and 17% in 2010), and Lenovo Group Limited accounted for 11% of our net revenue (9% in 2011 and 8% in 2010). No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue during such periods. For information about revenue and operating income by operating segment, and revenue from unaffiliated customers by country, see Note 28: Operating Segment and Geographic Information in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Sales Arrangements Our products are sold through sales offices throughout the world. Sales of our products are typically made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, private-label branding, and other matters. Most of our sales are made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology. Our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer, even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related cost of sales is deferred. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, generally 30 days after shipment or delivery. Our credit department sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual customers to control credit risk to Intel arising from outstanding account balances. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis, and from this analysis, we establish credit limits and determine whether we will use one or more credit support devices, such as a parent guarantee or standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. For information about our allowance for doubtful receivables, see Schedule IIValuation and Qualifying Accounts in Part IV of this Form 10-K. Most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. On most products, there is no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. We have the option to grant credit for, repair, or replace defective products, and there is no contractual limit on the amount of credit that may be granted to a distributor for defective products. Distribution Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. We also utilize third-party sales representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others. Sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory; instead, their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers.  Backlog Over time, our larger customers have generally moved to lean-inventory or just-in-time operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products. We have arrangements with these customers to seek to quickly fill orders from regional warehouses. As a result, our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance non-binding commitments from customers as to future purchases. Our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Only a small portion of our orders is non-cancelable, and the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant. Seasonal Trends Historically, our platform sales have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter; however, our sales have not followed this trend over the past two years. Marketing Our corporate marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known Intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel  Core  processor family and the Intel  Atom  , Intel  Pentium  , Intel  Xeon  , Intel  Xeon Phi  and Intel  Itanium  trademarks make up our processor brands. We promote brand awareness and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities include television, print, and Internet advertising, as well as press relations and social media, consumer and trade events, and industry and consumer communications. We market to consumer and business audiences, and focus on building awareness and generating demand for new form factors such as Ultrabook systems, and for increased performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as Internet connectivity and security. Purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the Intel Inside  Program. This program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Through the Intel Inside  Program, certain customers are licensed to place Intel logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses the OEMs for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to the OEMs meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include television, print, and Internet marketing. We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers. Intellectual Property Rights and Licensing Intellectual property (IP) that applies to our products and services includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, and maskwork rights. We maintain a program to protect our investment in technology by attempting to ensure respect for our IP. The extent of the legal protection given to different types of IP varies under different countries legal systems. We intend to license our IP where we can obtain adequate consideration. See Competition earlier in this section, Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, and Note 27: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We have obtained patents in the U.S. and other countries. While our patents are an important element of our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, and the comparative pace of governments patenting processes, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire; in some cases, our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are granted. As we expand our products into new industries, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products. In addition to developing patents based on our own research and development efforts, we purchase patents from third parties to supplement our patent portfolio. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other IP, may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our component-level and platform products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.  In the first quarter of 2011, we entered into a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA. Under the agreement, we received a license to all of NVIDIAs patents with a capture period that runs through March 2017 while NVIDIA products are licensed under our patents with the same capture period, subject to exclusions for x86 products, certain chipsets, and certain flash memory technology products. Compliance with Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations Our compliance efforts focus on monitoring regulatory and resource trends and setting company-wide performance targets for key resources and emissions. These targets address several parameters, including product design; chemical, energy, and water use; waste recycling; the source of certain minerals used in our products; climate change; and emissions. As a company, we focus on reducing natural resource use, the solid and chemical waste by-products of our manufacturing processes, and the environmental impact of our products. We currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of EHS laws and regulations. Over the past several years, we have significantly reduced the use of lead and halogenated flame retardants in our products and manufacturing processes. We work with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), OEMs, and retailers to help manage e-waste (including electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives) and to promote recycling. The European Union requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that let consumers return products for recycling. Many states in the U.S. have similar e-waste take-back laws. Although these laws are typically targeted at the end electronic product and not the component products that we manufacture, the inconsistency of many e-waste take-back laws and the lack of local e-waste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts. We are an industry leader in our efforts to build ethical sourcing of minerals for our products, including conflict minerals coming out of central Africa. In 2013, Intel will continue to work to establish a conflict-free supply chain for our company and our industry. In 2012, Intel verified, after reasonable inquiry, that the tantalum we use in our microprocessors is conflict-free, and our goal for the end of 2013 is to manufacture the worlds first verified, conflict-free microprocessor. We seek to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers to improve energy efficiency. We take a holistic approach to power management, addressing the challenge at the silicon, package, circuit, micro-architecture, macro architecture, platform, and software levels. We recognize that climate change may cause general economic risk. For further information on the risks of climate change, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We see a potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations. This could include items applied to utility companies that are passed along to customers, such as carbon taxes or costs associated with obtaining permits for our U.S. manufacturing operations, emission cap and trade programs, or renewable portfolio standards. We are committed to sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives and working proactively with governments, environmental groups, and industry to promote global environmental sustainability. We believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the worlds environmental challenges, and we are joining forces with industry, business, and governments to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to combat climate change. We have been purchasing wind power and other forms of renewable energy at some of our major sites for several years. We purchase renewable energy certificates under a multi-year contract. This purchase has placed Intel at the top of the EPAs Green Power Partnership for the past four years and is intended to help stimulate the market for green power, leading to additional generating capacity and, ultimately, lower costs.

If product demand decreases, our revenue and profit could be harmed. Important factors that could cause demand for our products to decrease include changes in: ##TABLE_START   business conditions, including downturns in the computing industry, regional economies, and the overall economy; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   consumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the level of customers inventories; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   customer product needs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   market acceptance of our products and maturing product cycles; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the technology supply chain, including supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. ##TABLE_END Our operations have high costsincluding costs related to facility construction and equipment, RD, and employment and training of a highly skilled workforcethat are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. At the same time, demand for our products is highly variable. If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. Our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. Factory-planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation. If product demand increases, we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand. These changes in product demand, and changes in our customers product needs, could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us to write down our assets. We operate in highly competitive industries, and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological and market developments could harm our ability to compete. We operate in highly competitive industries that experience rapid technological and market developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to these developments, we may weaken our competitive position, and our products or technologies may be uncompetitive or obsolete. As computing market segments emerge, such as smartphones, tablets, and consumer electronics devices, we face new sources of competition and customers with different needs than customers in our PC business. Some of our competitors in these market segments are pursuing a vertical integration strategy, incorporating their SoC solutions into the smartphones and tablets they offer, which could make it less likely that they will adopt our SoC solutions. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships in these market segments. As the number and variety of Internet-connected devices increase, we need to improve the cost, connectivity, energy efficiency, and security of our platforms to succeed in these market segments. And we need to expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful RD effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors. Our RD efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems, and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, and the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers. Additionally, the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for our products. These types of events could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce revenue, increase costs, lower gross margin percentage, or require us to impair our assets. Changes in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results. Because of the wide price differences of platform average selling prices among our data center, PC client, and other Intel architecture platforms, a change in the mix of platforms among these market segments may impact our revenue and gross margin. For example, our PC client platforms that are incorporated in notebook and desktop computers tend to have lower average selling prices and gross margin than our data center platforms that are incorporated in servers, workstations and storage products. Therefore, if there is less demand for our data center platforms, and a resulting mix shift to our PC client platforms, our gross margins and revenue would decrease. Also, more recently introduced products tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross margin.  Our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our results of operations and financial condition. We have sales offices, RD, manufacturing, assembly and test facilities, and other facilities in many countries, and some business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas. As a result, our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products may be affected by: ##TABLE_START   security concerns, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, and terrorist activity; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   natural disasters and health concerns; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   inefficient and limited infrastructure and disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, or telecommunications providers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   restrictions on our operations by governments seeking to support local industries, nationalization of our operations, and restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   differing employment practices and labor issues; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations. ##TABLE_END Legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, or agents may violate our policies. Although most of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses may be paid in local currencies. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in tariff and import regulations and in U.S. and non-U.S. monetary policies may harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our expenses and reducing revenue. Differing tax rates in various jurisdictions could harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our overall tax rate. We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. We place our insurance coverage with multiple carriers in numerous jurisdictions. However, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies have deductibles and exclusions that result in us retaining a level of self-insurance. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Failure to meet our production targets, resulting in undersupply or oversupply of products, may harm our business and results of operations. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. Disruptions in this process can result from errors; difficulties in our development and implementation of new processes; defects in materials; disruptions in our supply of materials or resources; and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditionsall of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. We may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes. Production issues may result in our failure to meet or increase production as desired, resulting in higher costs or large decreases in yields, which could affect our ability to produce sufficient volume to meet product demand. The unavailability or reduced availability of products could make it more difficult to deliver computing platforms. The occurrence of these events could harm our business and results of operations. We may have difficulties obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing, assembling and testing our products, or operating other aspects of our business, which could harm our ability to meet demand and increase our costs. We have thousands of suppliers providing materials that we use in production and other aspects of our business, and where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials. However, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location, for these materials. The inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. Production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. Future environmental regulations could restrict the supply or increase the cost of materials that we use in our business and make it more difficult to obtain permits to build or modify manufacturing capacity to meet demand. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs. The occurrence of these events could harm our business and results of operations.  Costs related to product defects and errata may harm our results of operations and business. Costs of product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) due to, for example, problems in our design and manufacturing processes, could include: ##TABLE_START   writing off the value of inventory; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   disposing of products that cannot be fixed; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   recalling products that have been shipped; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   providing product replacements or modifications; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   defending against litigation. ##TABLE_END These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin. Our reputation with customers or end users could be damaged as a result of product defects and errata, and product demand could be reduced. The announcement of product defects and errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of Intel components or for other reasons. These factors could harm our business and financial results. Third parties might attempt to breach our network security and our products and services, which could damage our reputation and financial results. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our IT systems. Additionally, malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide. These attempts might be the result of industrial or other espionage or actions by hackers seeking to harm our company, our products and services, or users of our products and services. Due to the widespread use of our products and due to the high profile of our McAfee subsidiary, we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users, steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees and customers, or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others. We believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication. These attacks are sometimes successful; and in some instances we, our customers and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We seek to detect and investigate such attempts and incidents and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and/or changes or patches to our products and services, but in some cases preventive and remedial action might not be successful. Such attacks, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in our incurring costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, reduced inventory value, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. Publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. We may be subject to theft, loss or misuse of personal data about us or our customers or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation or result in litigation. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Costs to comply with and implement privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. Our failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. Third parties may claim infringement of IP rights, which could harm our business. We may face IP rights infringement claims from individuals and companies, including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies. We are engaged in a number of litigation matters involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others could cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. As a result of IP rights infringement claims, we could: ##TABLE_START   pay infringement claims; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   stop manufacturing, using, or selling products or technology subject to infringement claims; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   develop other products or technology not subject to infringement claims, which could be time-consuming, costly or impossible; or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   license technology from the party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. ##TABLE_END These actions could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.  We may be unable to enforce or protect our IP rights, which may harm our ability to compete and may harm our business. Our ability to enforce our patents, copyrights, software licenses, and other IP rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we are often subject to claims that the IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to the opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights often results in the other party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. Governments may adopt regulationsand governments or courts may render decisionsrequiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business. We may be subject to IP theft or misuse, which could result in claims against us and harm our business and results of operations. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; the value of our investment in RD, product development, and marketing could be reduced; and third parties might make claims against us related to losses of confidential or proprietary information or end-user data, or system reliability. These incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm. Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights. Companies in the computing industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements between them. Our competitors may have licenses to our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired. Litigation or regulatory proceedings could harm our business. We may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. As described in Note 27: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling products, engaging in business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added resellers, OEMs, Internet service providers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors). Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk, and compliance risks. Distributors may sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of FCPA or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position. We face risks related to sales to government entities. We derive a portion of our revenue from sales to government entities and their respective agencies. Government demand and payment for our products may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations. Government contracts are subject to oversight, including special rules on accounting, expenses, reviews, and security. Failing to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines and suspensions, or debarment from future government business. We invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments. We make investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. These investments include equity or debt instruments of public or private companies, and many of these instruments are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. Companies range from early-stage companies that are still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The companies in which we invest may fail because they are unable to secure additional funding, obtain favorable terms for future financings, or participate in liquidity events such as public offerings, mergers, and private sales. If any of these companies fail, we could lose all or part of our investment. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment, we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize a loss, impacting gains (losses) on equity investments, net. The majority of our marketable equity security portfolio balance is concentrated in ASML, and declines in the value of our ASML holdings could result in impairment charges, impacting gains (losses) on equity investments, net.  Our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies. The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies have a large impact on our results of operations. For more information, see Critical Accounting Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. These methods, estimates, and judgments are subject to large risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and changes could affect our results of operations. Changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations. A number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including: ##TABLE_START   the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the resolution of issues arising from tax audits; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairments of goodwill; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   changes in available tax credits; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of non-U.S income and expenses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. ##TABLE_END Decisions about the scope of operations of our business could affect our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in the business environment could lead to changes in the scope of our operations, resulting in restructuring and asset impairment charges. Factors that could affect our results of operations and financial condition due to a change in the scope of our operations include: ##TABLE_START   timing and execution of plans and programs subject to local labor law requirements, including consultation with work councils; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   changes in assumptions related to severance and postretirement costs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   divestitures; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   new business initiatives and changes in product roadmap, development, and manufacturing; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   changes in employment levels and turnover rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   changes in product demand and the business environment; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   changes in the fair value of long-lived assets. ##TABLE_END Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and enter into agreements for possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions, such as joint ventures. Acquisitions and other transactions involve large challenges and risks, including risks that: ##TABLE_START   we may be unable to identify opportunities on terms acceptable to us; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the transaction may not advance our business strategy; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   we may not realize a satisfactory return; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   we may be unable to retain key personnel; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   we may experience difficulty in integrating new employees, business systems, and technology; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   acquired businesses may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our due diligence process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   we may have difficulty entering new market segments; or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   we may be unable to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses. ##TABLE_END When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed-upon terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur added expense, or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, resulting in a loss on the transaction. If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to factors such as: ##TABLE_START   failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   IP disputes or other litigation; or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   difficulties obtaining financing for the transaction. ##TABLE_END Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could harm our business and results of operations. The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of EHS laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in: ##TABLE_START   regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   suspension of production; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   alteration of our fabrication and assembly and test processes; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   restrictions on our operations or sales. ##TABLE_END Our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. In addition to the possible direct economic impact that climate change could have on us, climate change mitigation programs and regulations can increase our costs. The cost of perfluorocompounds (PFCs)a gas that we use in manufacturingcould increase under some climate-change-focused emissions trading programs that may be imposed through regulation. If the use of PFCs is prohibited, we would need to obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. Air-quality permit requirements for our manufacturing operations could become more burdensome and cause delays in our ability to modify or build additional manufacturing capacity. Under recently adopted greenhouse gas regulations in the U.S., many of our manufacturing facilities have become major sources under the Clean Air Act. At a minimum, this change in status results in some uncertainty as the EPA adopts guidance on its greenhouse gas regulations. Due to the dynamic nature of our operations, these regulations will likely result in increased costs for our U.S. operations. These cost increases could be associated with new air pollution control requirements, and increased or new monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. We also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations. Our costs could increase if utility companies pass on their costs, such as those associated with carbon taxes, emission cap and trade programs, or renewable portfolio standards. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disasters or events. Many of our operations are located in semi-arid regions, such as Israel and the southwestern U.S. Some scenarios predict that these regions may become even more vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. In order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate key employees, and our failure to do so could harm our results of operations. In order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees in the semiconductor industry can be intense. Our current Chief Executive Officer (CEO) plans to retire in May 2013, and the Board of Directors is working to choose a successor. The succession and transition process may have a direct or indirect effect on business and operations. In connection with the appointment of the new CEO, we will seek to retain our executive management team (some of whom are being considered for the CEO position), and keep employees focused on achieving our strategic goals and objectives. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. A number of factors could lower interest and other, net, harming our results of operations. Factors that could lower interest and other, net in our consolidated statements of income include changes in fixed-income, equity, and credit markets; foreign currency exchange rates; interest rates; credit standing of financial instrument counterparties; our cash and investment balances; and our indebtedness.  ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

We expect construction of the Arizona building to be completed in 2013. We expect that these new facilities will allow us to widen our process technology lead. These new facilities are expected to support incremental opportunities in unit growth and product mix. Outside the U.S., we have wafer fabrication at our facilities in Ireland, China, and Israel. Our assembly and test facilities are located in Malaysia, China, Costa Rica, and Vietnam. In addition, we have sales and marketing offices worldwide that are generally located near major concentrations of customers. We believe that the facilities described above are suitable and adequate for our present purposes and that the productive capacity in our facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize it.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Overview Our results of operations were as follows: ##TABLE_START          Three Months Ended   Twelve Months Ended  (Dollars in Millions)  Dec. 29, 2012   Sept. 29, 2012   Change   Dec. 29, 2012   Dec. 31, 2011   Change  Net revenue  $ 13,477   $ 13,457   $ 20   $ 53,341   $ 53,999   $ (658 ) Gross margin  $ 7,817   $ 8,515   $ (698 )  $ 33,151   $ 33,757   $ (606 ) Gross margin percentage   58.0 %   63.3 %   (5.3 )%   62.1 %   62.5 %   (0.4 )% Operating income  $ 3,155   $ 3,841   $ (686 )  $ 14,638   $ 17,477   $ (2,839 ) Net income  $ 2,468   $ 2,972   $ (504 )  $ 11,005   $ 12,942   $ (1,937 ) Diluted earnings per common share  $ 0.48   $ 0.58   $ (0.10 )  $ 2.13   $ 2.39   $ (0.26 ) ##TABLE_END  Our revenue for 2012 was down 1% from 2011 and lower than we expected at the start of the year. Worldwide gross domestic product growth was less than expected as we entered 2012, and PC Client Group revenue was negatively impacted by the growth of tablets as these devices compete with PCs for consumer sales. Data Center Group revenue grew 6% in 2012 as a richer mix of products and significant growth in the Internet cloud segment was partially offset by weakness in the enterprise market segment. Our gross margin percentage for 2012 was flat compared to 2011 as higher excess capacity charges and higher platform unit costs were offset by lower start-up costs and no impact in 2012 for the Intel  6 Series Express Chipset design issue. Our fourth quarter revenue of $13.5 billion was flat from the third quarter of 2012. Historically, our revenue generally has increased in the fourth quarter. However, softness in PC demand and continued decline of inventory in the PC supply chain as OEMs reduce inventory on older-generation products negatively impacted our results for the fourth quarter. The decline in our gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter was driven by excess capacity charges as we responded to lower demand by bringing down inventory levels and redirecting capital resources to our 14nm process technology. Our gross margin was also negatively impacted by higher inventory reserves on production of our next-generation microarchitecture products, code-named Haswell, which we expect to qualify for sale in the first quarter of 2013. During 2012 we made significant product introductions across all our businesses, including PC client, servers, smartphones and tablets, and extended our manufacturing and process technology leadership. We launched our next-generation server-based products, the Intel Xeon processor E5 family, which provides higher performance and better energy-efficiency than prior-generation products. In 2012 we continued to extend our process technology leadership with the introduction of our 22nm process technology products that utilize three-dimensional Tri-Gate transistor technology. These products also improve performance and energy efficiency compared to prior generation products and helped us accelerate our Ultrabook strategy. In 2012 we entered the smartphone market segment with six mobile phone providers launching the first Intel architecture-based smartphones. We are also expanding in the tablet market segment with designs based on Android* and Windows* operating systems currently shipping. In a challenging environment our business continues to produce significant cash from operations, generating $18.9 billion in 2012. We returned $4.4 billion to stockholders through dividends and repurchased $4.8 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. In addition, we purchased $11.0 billion in capital assets as we continue to make significant investments to extend our manufacturing leadership. During the third quarter of 2012, we also entered into a series of agreements with ASML intended to accelerate the development of 450-millimeter (mm) wafer technology and extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography. The agreements included Intels purchase of ASML equity securities totaling $3.2 billion. We also took advantage of the low interest rate environment in 2012 and issued $6.2 billion of senior notes. From a financial condition perspective, we ended the year with an investment portfolio of $18.2 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets. In January 2013, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.225 per common share for the first quarter of 2013. As we look into 2013, we expect revenue to grow in the low single digits with particular strength in our server market segment. We believe the renewed innovation in the PC industry that we fostered with Ultrabook systems and expanded to other thin and light form factors, will blur the lines between tablets and notebooks and provide growth opportunities in 2013. We also expect to launch new SoCs for smartphones and tablets, based on our 22nm process technology. In 2013, we expect an increase in capital expenditures primarily driven by beginning construction of a 450mm development facility as we progress toward manufacturing with 450mm wafer technology later in the decade.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Our Business Outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2013 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (RD plus MGA), and capital expenditures. We will keep our most current Business Outlook publicly available on our Investor Relations web site www.intc.com . This Business Outlook is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in Business Outlook or in this Form 10-K. The public can continue to rely on the Business Outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we publish a notice stating otherwise. The statements in Business Outlook and forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times. The forward-looking statements in Business Outlook will be effective through the close of business on March 15, 2013 unless updated earlier. From the close of business on March 15, 2013 until our quarterly earnings release is published, currently scheduled for April 16, 2013, we will observe a quiet period. During the quiet period, Business Outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our Form 8-K filed on January 17, 2013, and other forward-looking statements disclosed in the companys news releases and filings with the SEC, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this Form 10-K, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. During the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our Business Outlook or our financial results or expectations. The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion. Critical Accounting Estimates The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: ##TABLE_START   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity investments, net when we record impairments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment; goodwill; and identified intangibles), which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment. ##TABLE_END In the following section, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. Non-Marketable Equity Investments We regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $2.2 billion as of December 29, 2012 ($2.8 billion as of December 31, 2011). Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. Our non-marketable equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success depends on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, the ability of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile, and other key business factors. The companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings. These events could cause our investments to become impaired. In addition, financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. For further information about our investment portfolio risks, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for disclosure purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as projected revenues, earnings, and comparable performance multiples. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of relevant factors, including comparable companies sizes, growth rates, industries, and development stages. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee: revenue; expenses, capital spending, and other costs; and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenue, expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed using available market, historical, and forecast data. The valuation of our non-marketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, the investees capital structures, the terms of the investees issued interests, and the lack of marketability of the investments. For non-marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment, such as: ##TABLE_START   the investees revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the technological feasibility of the investees products and technologies; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory and economic changes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   factors related to the investees ability to remain in business, such as the investees liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. ##TABLE_END If the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value. Impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $104 million in 2012. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2012, impairments of non- marketable equity investments ranged from $8 million to $59 million per quarter. Long-Lived Assets Property, Plant and Equipment We assess property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset groupings carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. We measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset groupings carrying value and its fair value. Property, plant and equipment is considered a non-financial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. Impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets new, shorter useful lives. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2012, impairments and accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment ranged from zero to $36 million per quarter. Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased operations to our existing business units as well as the acquired business unit. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in Note 28: Operating Segment and Geographic Information in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value. For reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. For reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform additional testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. If we determine during this second step that the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income method and the market method to estimate the reporting units fair value. The income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following reporting unit estimates: revenue, based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share; estimated costs; and appropriate discount rates based on the reporting units weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. Our estimates of market segment growth, our market segment share, and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and a variety of external sources. These estimates are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process. The same estimates are also used in planning for our long-term manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process, and for long-term and short-term business planning and forecasting. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data. The market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. The reporting units carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. For the annual impairment assessment in 2012, we determined that for each of our reporting units with significant amounts of goodwill, it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value. As a result, we concluded that performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary for those reporting units. During the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years, we completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years. Identified Intangibles We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinite-lived intangible assets, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If we determine that an individual asset is impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Based on our impairment reviews of our intangible assets, we recognized impairment charges of $21 million in 2012, $10 million in 2011, and no impairment charges in 2010. Income Taxes We must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should a change occur in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity, and effectively settled issues. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Inventory The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. The estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. As of December 29, 2012, we had total work-in-process inventory of $2.2 billion and total finished goods inventory of $2.0 billion. The demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin. To determine which costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; therefore, it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. In the fourth quarter of 2012, excess capacity charges were $480 million. In the previous 11 quarters, excess capacity charges were less than $50 million in each quarter. Loss Contingencies We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and asserted and potential claims as well as accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata, and product warranties and potential asset impairments (loss contingencies) that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred. The outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims, and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments, are subject to significant uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. With respect to estimating the losses associated with repairing and replacing parts in connection with product errata, we make judgments with respect to customer return rates, costs to repair or replace parts, and where the product is in our customers manufacturing process. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter, and we may revise our estimates. These revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Accounting Changes For a description of accounting changes, see Note 3: Accounting Changes.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated: ##TABLE_START          2012   2011   2010  (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  Dollars   % of Net Revenue   Dollars   % of Net Revenue   Dollars   % of Net Revenue  Net revenue  $ 53,341    100.0 %  $ 53,999    100.0 %  $ 43,623    100.0 % Cost of sales   20,190    37.9 %   20,242    37.5 %   15,132    34.7 %              Gross margin   33,151    62.1 %   33,757    62.5 %   28,491    65.3 %              Research and development   10,148    19.0 %   8,350    15.4 %   6,576    15.1 % Marketing, general and administrative   8,057    15.1 %   7,670    14.2 %   6,309    14.5 % Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles   308    0.6 %   260    0.5 %   18     %              Operating income   14,638    27.4 %   17,477    32.4 %   15,588    35.7 % Gains (losses) on equity investments, net   141    0.3 %   112    0.2 %   348    0.8 % Interest and other, net   94    0.2 %   192    0.3 %   109    0.3 %              Income before taxes   14,873    27.9 %   17,781    32.9 %   16,045    36.8 % Provision for taxes   3,868    7.3 %   4,839    8.9 %   4,581    10.5 %              Net income  $ 11,005    20.6 %  $ 12,942    24.0 %  $ 11,464    26.3 %              Diluted earnings per common share  $ 2.13    $ 2.39    $ 2.01             ##TABLE_END  Our net revenue for 2012, which included 52 weeks, decreased by $658 million, or 1%, compared to 2011, which included 53 weeks. PC Client Group and Data Center Group platform volume decreased 1% while average selling prices were unchanged. Additionally, lower IMC average selling prices and lower netbook platform volume contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by our McAfee operating segment, which we acquired in the first quarter of 2011. McAfee contributed $469 million of additional revenue in 2012 compared to 2011. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2012 decreased by $606 million, or 2%, compared to 2011. The decrease was due in large part to approximately $490 million of excess capacity charges, as well as lower PC Client Group and Data Center Group platform revenue. To a lesser extent, higher PC Client Group and Data Center Group platform unit costs as well as lower netbook and IMC revenue contributed to the decrease. The decrease was partially offset by approximately $645 million of lower start-up costs as we transition from our 22nm process technology to RD of our next-generation 14nm process technology, as well as $422 million of charges recorded in 2011 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel 6 Series Express Chipset family. The decrease was also partially offset by the two additional months of results from our acquisition of McAfee, which occurred on February 28, 2011, contributing approximately $334 million of additional gross margin dollars in 2012 compared to 2011. The amortization of acquisition-related intangibles resulted in a $557 million reduction to our overall gross margin dollars in 2012, compared to $482 million in 2011, primarily due to acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2011. Our overall gross margin percentage in 2012 was flat from 2011 as higher excess capacity charges and higher PC Client Group and Data Center Group platform unit costs in 2012 were offset by lower start-up costs and no impact in 2012 for the Intel 6 Series Express Chipset design issue. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2012 and 2011 from the sale of platforms in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. Our net revenue for 2011, which included 53 weeks, increased $10.4 billion, or 24%, compared to 2010, which included 52 weeks. PC Client Group and Data Center Group platform revenue increased $6.3 billion on 8% higher average selling prices and 7% higher unit sales. Additionally, $3.6 billion of the increase in revenue was due to acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2011 (primarily IMC and McAfee). Our overall gross margin dollars for 2011 increased $5.3 billion, or 18%, compared to 2010, primarily reflecting higher revenue from our existing business and our acquisitions as discussed previously. The increase was partially offset by approximately $1.0 billion of higher start-up costs compared to 2010. The amortization of acquisition-related intangibles resulted in a $482 million reduction to our overall gross margin dollars in 2011, compared to $65 million in 2010, primarily due to the acquisitions in the first quarter of 2011.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 62.5% in 2011 from 65.3% in 2010. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage decrease in the PC Client Group and, to a lesser extent, the gross margin percentage decrease in the other Intel architecture operating segments. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2011 and most of our gross margin dollars in 2010 from the sale of platforms in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. PC Client Group The revenue and operating income for the PC Client Group for the three years ended December 29, 2012 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    (In Millions)  2012   2011   2010  Net revenue  $ 34,274   $ 35,406   $ 30,327  Operating income  $ 13,053   $ 14,793   $ 12,971  ##TABLE_END Net revenue for the PCCG operating segment decreased by $1.1 billion, or 3%, in 2012 compared to 2011. PCCG revenue was negatively impacted by the growth of tablets as these devices compete with PCs for consumer sales. Platform average selling prices and unit sales decreased 2% and 1%, respectively. The decrease was driven by 6% lower notebook platform average selling prices and 5% lower desktop platform volume. These decreases were partially offset by a 4% increase in desktop platform average selling prices and a 2% increase in notebook platform volume. Operating income decreased by $1.7 billion, or 12%, in 2012 compared to 2011 driven by $649 million of lower gross margin and $1.1 billion of higher operating expenses. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower platform revenue. Additionally, approximately $455 million of higher excess capacity charges and higher platform unit costs contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by approximately $785 million of lower start-up costs as we transition from manufacturing start-up costs related to our 22nm process technology to RD of our next-generation 14nm process technology. Additionally, the first half of 2011 included $422 million of charges recorded to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel 6 Series Express Chipset family. Net revenue for the PCCG operating segment increased by $5.1 billion, or 17%, in 2011 compared to 2010. Platform average selling prices and unit sales increased 8% and 7%, respectively. The increase in revenue was due to notebook platform unit sales and notebook platform average selling prices, which both increased 9%. To a lesser extent, an increase in desktop platform average selling prices of 6% and an increase in desktop platform unit sales of 4% also contributed to the increase. In addition to the extra work week in 2011, our client business benefited from rising incomes that increased the affordability of PCs in emerging markets. We also saw an increase in revenue as demand increased in the enterprise and emerging markets for higher performance and more energy-efficient computing. Operating income increased by $1.8 billion in 2011 compared to 2010 as the gross margin increase of $2.4 billion was partially offset by $584 million of higher operating expenses. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher platform revenue partially offset by approximately $960 million of higher start-up costs as we transitioned into production using our 22nm process technology. Higher platform unit costs and inventory write-offs as compared to 2010 also contributed to the offset.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Data Center Group The revenue and operating income for the Data Center Group for the three years ended December 29, 2012 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    (In Millions)  2012   2011   2010  Net revenue  $ 10,741   $ 10,129   $ 8,693  Operating income  $ 5,073   $ 5,100   $ 4,388  ##TABLE_END Net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased by $612 million, or 6%, in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase in revenue was due to 6% higher platform average selling prices, slightly offset by 1% lower platform volume. Our platform average selling prices benefited from a richer mix of products sold. In 2012, our server business continued to benefit from significant growth in the Internet cloud segment offset by weakness in the enterprise server market segment. Operating income decreased by $27 million in 2012 compared to 2011 as $360 million of higher gross margin was more than offset by $387 million of higher operating expenses. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher platform revenue. Net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased by $1.4 billion, or 17%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in revenue was due to a 12% increase in platform unit sales. Our server business benefited from growth in the number of devices that compute and connect to the Internet, driving the build-out of the cloud infrastructure. Additionally, platform average selling prices increased 3% due to an increased demand for higher-performance computing. Operating income increased by $712 million in 2011 compared to 2010 as the gross margin increase of $1.2 billion was partially offset by $487 million of higher operating expenses. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher platform revenue. Other Intel Architecture Operating Segments The revenue and operating income (loss) for the other Intel architecture operating segments, including the Intelligent Systems Group, Intel Mobile Communications, the Netbook Group, the Tablet Group, the Phone Group, and the Service Provider Group for the three years ended December 29, 2012 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    (In Millions)  2012   2011   2010  Net revenue  $ 4,378   $ 5,005   $ 3,055  Operating income (loss)  $ (1,377 )  $ (577 )  $ 270  ##TABLE_END Net revenue for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $627 million, or 13%, in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower IMC average selling prices and lower netbook platform volume. To a lesser extent, lower netbook platform average selling prices contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher ISG platform average selling prices. Operating results for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $800 million from an operating loss of $577 million in 2011 to an operating loss of $1.4 billion in 2012. The decline in operating results was primarily due to lower netbook revenue and higher operating expenses in the Other IA operating segments. Additionally, lower IMC revenue was largely offset by lower IMC unit cost. Net revenue for the Other IA operating segments increased by $2.0 billion, or 64%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to IMC revenue, an operating segment formed from the acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon in the first quarter of 2011. To a lesser extent, higher ISG platform unit sales also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by lower netbook platform unit sales. Operating results for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $847 million from an operating income of $270 million in 2010 to an operating loss of $577 million in 2011. The decline in operating results was primarily due to higher operating expenses within each of the Other IA operating segments, partially offset by higher revenue.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Software and Services Operating Segments The revenue and operating income (loss) for the SSG operating segments, including McAfee, the Wind River Software Group, and the Software and Services Group, for the three years ended December 29, 2012 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    (In Millions)  2012   2011   2010  Net revenue  $ 2,381   $ 1,870   $ 264  Operating income (loss)  $ (11 )  $ (32 )  $ (175 ) ##TABLE_END Net revenue for the SSG operating segments increased by $511 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to two months of incremental revenue from McAfee of $469 million. McAfee was acquired on February 28, 2011. The operating loss for the SSG operating segments decreased by $21 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease in operating loss was primarily due to higher McAfee revenue, partially offset by higher McAfee operating expenses. Net revenue for the SSG operating segments increased by $1.6 billion in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was due to revenue from McAfee, which was acquired on February 28, 2011. Due to the revaluation of McAfees historic deferred revenue to fair value at the time of acquisition, we excluded $204 million of revenue that would have been reported in 2011 if McAfees deferred revenue had not been written down due to the acquisition. The operating loss for the SSG operating segments decreased by $143 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease was due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses across each of the SSG operating segments. Due to the revaluation of McAfees historic deferred revenue to fair value at the time of acquisition, we excluded revenue and associated costs that would have increased operating results by $190 million in 2011. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three years ended December 29, 2012 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    (Dollars In Millions)  2012   2011   2010  Research and development  $ 10,148   $ 8,350   $ 6,576  Marketing, general and administrative  $ 8,057   $ 7,670   $ 6,309  RD and MGA as percentage of net revenue   34 %   30 %   30 % Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles  $ 308   $ 260   $ 18  ##TABLE_END  Research and Development. RD spending increased by $1.8 billion, or 22%, in 2012 compared to 2011, and increased by $1.8 billion, or 27%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in 2012 compared to 2011 was driven by increased investments in our products for smartphones, tablets, Ultrabook systems, and data centers. Additionally, RD spending increased due to higher process development costs for our next-generation 14nm process technology, higher compensation expenses mainly due to annual salary increases, the full first quarter expenses of IMC and McAfee in 2012 (both acquired in the first quarter of 2011), and higher costs related to the development of 450mm wafer technology. The increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the expenses of McAfee and IMC, and to higher compensation expenses based on an increase in the number of employees. In addition, lower overall process development costs due to the transition to manufacturing start-up costs related to our 22nm process technology were mostly offset by higher process development costs due to RD of our next-generation 14nm process technology. Marketing, General and Administrative . Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased by $387 million, or 5%, in 2012 compared to 2011, and increased by $1.4 billion, or 22%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the full first quarter expenses of McAfee in 2012 and higher compensation expenses mainly due to annual salary increases as well as an increase in the number of employees. The increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the expenses of McAfee and IMC, higher compensation expenses based on an increase in the number of employees, and higher advertising expenses (including cooperative advertising expenses). Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles. The increase in 2012 compared to 2011 of $48 million was primarily due to the full year of amortization of intangibles in 2012 related to the acquisitions of McAfee and the WLS business of Infineon, both completed in the first quarter of 2011. The increase in 2011 compared to 2010 of $242 million was primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of McAfee and the WLS business of Infineon in 2011. For further information, see Note 13: Acquisitions and Note 16: Identified Intangible Assets in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation totaled $1.1 billion in 2012 ($1.1 billion in 2011 and $917 million in 2010). Share-based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses. As of December 29, 2012, unrecognized share-based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows: ##TABLE_START   (Dollars in Millions)  Unrecognized Share-Based Compensation Costs   Weighted Average Period  Stock options  $ 96    1.0 years  Restricted stock units  $ 1,523    1.3 years  ##TABLE_END As of December 29, 2012, there was $13 million in unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to the rights to acquire common stock under our stock purchase plan. We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately one and a half months. Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments and Interest and Other Gains (losses) on equity investments, net and interest and other, net for the three years ended December 29, 2012 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    (In Millions)  2012   2011   2010  Gains (losses) on equity investments, net  $ 141   $ 112   $ 348  Interest and other, net  $ 94   $ 192   $ 109  ##TABLE_END Net gains on equity investments were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower equity method losses and higher gains on third-party merger transactions, partially offset by lower gains on sales of equity investments. We recognized lower net gains on equity investments in 2011 compared to 2010 due to lower gains on sales of equity investments, higher equity method losses, and lower gains on third-party merger transactions. Net gains on equity investments for 2011 included a gain of $150 million on the sale of shares in VMware, Inc. During 2010, we recognized a gain of $181 million on the initial public offering of SMART Technologies, Inc. and the subsequent partial sale of our shares in the secondary offering. We also recognized a gain of $91 million on the sale of our ownership interest in Numonyx B.V., and a gain of $67 million on the sale of shares in Micron Technology, Inc. in 2010. Our share of equity method investee losses recognized in 2011 and 2010 was primarily related to Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC) ($145 million and $116 million, respectively). Our share of equity method investee losses recognized in 2011 reduced our carrying value in Clearwire LLC to zero. We do not expect to recognize additional equity method losses for Clearwire LLC in the future. Interest and other, net decreased in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to a $164 million gain recognized upon formation of the Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC (Care Innovations) joint venture during the first quarter of 2011 and higher interest expense in 2012. This decrease was partially offset by proceeds received from an insurance claim in the second quarter of 2012 related to the floods in Thailand. Interest and other, net increased in 2011 compared to 2010. The $164 million gain recognized upon formation of Care Innovations during 2011 was partially offset by the recognition of $41 million of interest expense in 2011 compared to zero in 2010 and lower interest income in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of lower average investment balances. We recognized interest expense during 2011 as the amount of interest incurred began to exceed the amount we were able to capitalize upon the issuance of $5.0 billion aggregate principal of senior unsecured notes in the third quarter of 2011.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Provision for Taxes Our provision for taxes and effective tax rate were as follows: ##TABLE_START    (Dollars in Millions)  2012   2011   2010  Income before taxes  $ 14,873   $ 17,781   $ 16,045  Provision for taxes  $ 3,868   $ 4,839   $ 4,581  Effective tax rate   26.0 %   27.2 %   28.6 % ##TABLE_END We generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2012 compared to 2011, positively impacting our effective tax rate for 2012. This impact was partially offset by a U.S. research and development tax credit that was not reinstated in 2012. The U.S. research and development tax credit was reenacted in January 2013 retroactive to the beginning of 2012. The full year 2012 impact of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit will be recognized in the first quarter 2013 financial statements and is expected to have a significant positive impact on the first quarter of 2013 effective tax rate. We generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2011 compared to 2010, positively impacting our effective tax rate for 2011. Liquidity and Capital Resources ##TABLE_START   (Dollars in Millions)  Dec. 29, 2012   Dec. 31, 2011  Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets  $ 18,162   $ 14,837  Loans receivable and other long-term investments  $ 1,472   $ 1,769  Short-term and long-term debt  $ 13,448   $ 7,331  Debt as percentage of stockholders equity   26.3 %   16.0 % ##TABLE_END  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Sources and Uses of Cash (In Millions) In summary, our cash flows were as follows: ##TABLE_START    (In Millions)  2012   2011   2010  Net cash provided by operating activities  $ 18,884   $ 20,963   $ 16,692  Net cash used for investing activities   (14,060 )   (10,301 )   (10,539 ) Net cash used for financing activities   (1,408 )   (11,100 )   (4,642 ) Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents   (3 )   5             Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents  $ 3,413   $ (433 )  $ 1,511         ##TABLE_END  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. For 2012 compared to 2011, the $2.1 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to lower net income and changes in our working capital, partially offset by adjustments for non-cash items. The adjustments for non-cash items were higher due primarily to higher depreciation in 2012 compared to 2011, partially offset by increases in non-acquisition-related deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2011 compared to December 25, 2010. Changes in assets and liabilities as of December 29, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011 included higher inventories on the ramp of 3rd generation Intel  Core  processor family products, partially offset by a significant reduction in older-generation products. For 2012, our three largest customers accounted for 43% of our net revenue (43% in 2011 and 46% in 2010), with Hewlett-Packard Company accounting for 18% of our net revenue (19% in 2011 and 21% in 2010), Dell accounting for 14% of our net revenue (15% in 2011 and 17% in 2010), and Lenovo accounting for 11% of our net revenue (9% in 2011 and 8% in 2010). These three customers accounted for 33% of our accounts receivable as of December 29, 2012 (36% as of December 31, 2011). For 2011 compared to 2010, the $4.3 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to adjustments for non-cash items and higher net income. The adjustments for non-cash items were higher for 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization of intangibles, as well as increases in non-acquisition-related deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2011 compared to December 25, 2010. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2011 compared to 2010 were $1.3 billion lower, largely due to the tax benefit of depreciating 100% of assets placed in service in the U.S. in 2011. Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; as well as cash used for acquisitions. The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to net purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets in 2012, as compared to net maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments and trading assets in 2011, partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions. Net purchases of available-for-sale investments in 2012 included our purchase of $3.2 billion of equity securities in ASML during the third quarter of 2012. Our capital expenditures were $11.0 billion in 2012 ($10.8 billion in 2011 and $5.2 billion in 2010). Cash used for investing activities decreased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010. A decrease due to net maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments in 2011 as compared to net purchases of available-for-sale investments in 2010 was offset by higher cash paid for acquisitions, of which the substantial majority was for our acquisition of McAfee in the first quarter of 2011, and an increase in capital expenditures. The significant increase in capital expenditures in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to the expansion of our network of fabrication facilities to include an additional large-scale fabrication facility, as well as bringing our 22nm process technology manufacturing capacity online. Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans. The decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2012, compared to 2011, was primarily due to fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program and, to a lesser extent, the issuance of a higher amount of long-term debt in 2012 compared to 2011. We have an ongoing authorization, since October 2005, as amended, from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $45 billion in shares of our common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions. During 2012, we repurchased $4.8 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program compared to $14.1 billion in 2011. As of December 29, 2012, $5.3 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled $2.1 billion in 2012 compared to $2.0 billion in 2011. Our total dividend payments were $4.4 billion in 2012 compared to $4.1 billion in 2011 as a result of an increase in quarterly cash dividends per common share. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 81 quarters. In January 2013, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.225 per common share for the first quarter of 2013. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2013 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2013.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, partially offset by the issuance of long-term debt in 2011 and higher proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans. Liquidity Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. As of December 29, 2012, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets totaled $18.2 billion ($14.8 billion as of December 31, 2011). In addition to the $18.2 billion, we have $1.5 billion in loans receivable and other long-term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in A/A2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated AA-/Aa3 or better. Our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2012 were $500 million, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 29, 2012. Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard  Poors and P-1 by Moodys as of December 29, 2012. We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we utilized this shelf registration statement and issued $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. These notes were issued for general corporate purposes and to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock repurchase program. For further information on the terms of the notes, see Note 19: Borrowings in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions or strategic investments. Fair Value of Financial Instruments When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligors credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. For further information, see Fair Value in Note 2: Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Marketable Debt Instruments As of December 29, 2012, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $15.3 billion of marketable debt instruments. Of these instruments, $5.2 billion was classified as Level 1, $10.0 billion as Level 2, and $126 million as Level 3. Our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active. Of the $10.0 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2, approximately 60% was classified as Level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model, and approximately 40% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data. Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. When observable market data is not available, we corroborate our fair value measurements using non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes from a second source. Loans Receivable and Reverse Repurchase Agreements As of December 29, 2012, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $780 million of loans receivable and $2.8 billion of reverse repurchase agreements. All of these investments were classified as Level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Marketable Equity Securities As of December 29, 2012, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $4.4 billion of marketable equity securities. All of these securities were classified as Level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 29, 2012: ##TABLE_START         Payments Due by Period  (In Millions)  Total   Less Than 1 Year   13 Years   35 Years   More Than 5 Years  Operating lease obligations  $ 909   $ 206   $ 315   $ 178   $ 210  Capital purchase obligations 1   4,618    4,554    64          Other purchase obligations and commitments 2   1,958    1,140    581    228    9  Long-term debt obligations 3   22,852    480    860    5,330    16,182  Other long-term liabilities 4, 5   1,714    627    652    330    105             Total 6  $ 32,051   $ 7,007   $ 2,472   $ 6,066   $ 16,506             ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1  Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 29, 2012, as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 2  Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include, for example, agreements to fund various projects with other companies. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 3  Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 4  We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $177 million of long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the preceding table. However, long-term income taxes payable, recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non-U.S. income taxes. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 5  Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Expected required contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $63 million to be made during 2013 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2013 are not practicable to estimate. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 6  Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. ##TABLE_END  Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services, included in other purchase obligations and commitments in the preceding table, include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements are not included in the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the preceding table. These obligations include milestone-based co-marketing agreements, contingent funding/payment obligations, and milestone-based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party. During 2012, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML intended to accelerate the development of 450mm wafer technology and EUV lithography. Intel agreed to provide RD funding totaling  829 million (approximately $1.1 billion as of December 29, 2012) over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from ASML. Our obligation is contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones. As a result, we have not included this obligation in the preceding table. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is not included in the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest. Contractual obligations with regard to our investment in IMFT are not included in the preceding table. We are currently committed to purchasing 49% of IMFTs production output and production-related services. We also have several agreements with Micron related to the supply of NAND flash memory products, IP, and RD funding related to non-volatile memory manufacturing. The obligation to purchase our proportion of IMFTs inventory was approximately $28 million as of December 29, 2012. For further information, see Note 10: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the table above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements As of December 29, 2012, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.  ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END We are directly and indirectly affected by changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of the potential changes that follow are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange Rates In general, we economically hedge currency risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases is incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, and the Israeli shekel. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. For further information, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $80 million as of December 29, 2012 (less than $40 million as of December 31, 2011). Interest Rates We generally hedge interest rate risks of fixed-rate debt instruments with interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to interest rate loss. We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and indebtedness. Our indebtedness includes our debt issuances and the liability associated with a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 29, 2012 (an increase of approximately $900 million as of December 31, 2011). The significant increase from December 31, 2011 was primarily driven by the inclusion of $6.2 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2012. A hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 1.0%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $10 million as of December 29, 2012 (an increase of approximately $20 million as of December 31, 2011). The fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in the fair value of our net investment position. For further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, see Note 4: Fair Value in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Equity Prices Our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities. However, for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments, we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks. Additionally, for our securities that we no longer consider strategic, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal, and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk. We hold derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. The gains and losses from changes in fair value of these derivatives are designed to offset the losses and gains on the related liabilities, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss.  As of December 29, 2012, the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $4.4 billion ($585 million as of December 31, 2011). Our marketable equity investment in ASML was carried at a total fair market value of $4.0 billion, or 90% of our marketable equity portfolio, as of December 29, 2012. Our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed necessary. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we have analyzed the expected market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a loss of 35% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $1.6 billion, based on the value as of December 29, 2012 (a decrease in value of approximately $265 million, based on the value as of December 31, 2011 using an assumed loss of 45%). Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity investments, excluding investments accounted for under the equity method, had a carrying amount of $1.2 billion as of December 29, 2012 ($1.1 billion as of December 31, 2011). As of December 29, 2012, the carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $1.0 billion ($1.6 billion as of December 31, 2011). The majority of the total non-marketable equity method investments balance as of December 29, 2012 was concentrated in our IMFT investment of $642 million ($1.3 billion in IMFT and IM Flash Singapore, LLP as of December 31, 2011).  ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Note 1: Basis of Presentation We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2012 and 2010 were 52-week years. Fiscal year 2011 was a 53-week year. The next 53-week year will end on December 31, 2016. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Intel Corporation and our subsidiaries. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We use the equity method to account for equity investments in instances in which we own common stock or similar interests and have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. In the first quarter of 2011, we completed the acquisition of McAfee, Inc. For further information, see Note 13: Acquisitions. Certain of the operations acquired from McAfee have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, we have recorded translation adjustments through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) beginning in 2011. Prior to the acquisition of McAfee, the U.S. dollar was the functional currency for our company and all of our subsidiaries; therefore, we did not record a translation adjustment through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for fiscal year 2010. Note 2: Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The accounting estimates that require our most significant, difficult, and subjective judgments include: ##TABLE_START   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment; goodwill; and identified intangibles); ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions); ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the valuation of inventory; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies. ##TABLE_ENDThe actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. Fair Value Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets and liabilities are measured and recorded at fair value, except for equity method investments, cost method investments, cost method loans receivable, reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months, and most of our liabilities. Fair Value Hierarchy The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data. For further discussion of fair value, see Note 4: Fair Value and Note 20: Retirement Benefit Plans.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Trading Assets Marketable debt instruments are generally designated as trading assets when the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument, or when the marketable debt instrument is used to economically hedge foreign exchange rate risk from the remeasurement of intercompany loans. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. The gains or losses of these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and intercompany loans, are recorded in interest and other, net. We also designate certain floating-rate securitized financial instruments, primarily asset-backed securities, as trading assets. Available-for-Sale Investments We consider all liquid available-for-sale debt instruments with original maturities from the date of purchase of approximately three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Available-for-sale debt instruments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Available-for-sale debt instruments with remaining maturities beyond one year are classified as other long-term investments. Investments that we designate as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except as noted in the Other-Than-Temporary Impairment section that follows. We determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level. Our available-for-sale investments include: ##TABLE_START   Marketable debt instruments when the interest rate and foreign currency risks are not hedged at the inception of ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   the investment or when our criteria for designation as trading assets are not met. We generally hold these debt instruments to generate a return commensurate with the U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR. We record the interest income and realized gains and losses on the sale of these instruments in interest and other, net. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Marketable equity securities when there are barriers to mitigating equity market risk through the sale or use of derivative instruments at the time of original classification, and when there is no plan to sell the investment at the time of original classification. We acquire these equity investments to promote business and strategic objectives. To the extent that these investments continue to have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks through hedging activities. We record the realized gains or losses on the sale or exchange of marketable equity securities in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END Non-Marketable and Other Equity Investments Our non-marketable equity and other equity investments are included in other long-term assets. We account for non-marketable equity and other equity investments for which we do not have control over the investee as: ##TABLE_START   Equity method investments when we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Equity method investments include marketable and non-marketable investments. Our proportionate share of the income or loss is recognized on a one-quarter lag and is recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Non-marketable cost method investments when the equity method does not apply. We record the realized gains or losses on the sale of non-marketable cost method investments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Our available-for-sale investments and non-marketable and other equity investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. Investments are considered impaired when the fair value is below the investments adjusted cost basis. Impairments affect earnings as follows: ##TABLE_START   Marketable debt instruments when the fair value is below amortized cost and we intend to sell the instrument, or when it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument (that is, a credit loss exists). When we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument, we separate other-than-temporary impairments into amounts representing credit losses, which are recognized in interest and other, net, and amounts related to all other factors, which are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Marketable equity securities based on the specific facts and circumstances present at the time of assessment, which include the consideration of general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is below cost, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of value in the foreseeable future. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and the business outlook for, the investee, which may include industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and changes in the investees credit rating. We record other-than-temporary impairment charges on marketable equity securities and marketable equity method investments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Non-marketable equity investments based on our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment, and qualitative and quantitative analysis, including: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the investees revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the technological feasibility of the investees products and technologies; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    factors related to the investees ability to remain in business, such as the investees liquidity and debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. ##TABLE_ENDWe record other-than-temporary impairment charges for non-marketable cost method investments and equity method investments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Derivative Financial Instruments Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk and commodity price risk. Our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. Our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for designation as a cash flow hedge. A designated hedge with exposure to variability in the functional currency equivalent of the future foreign currency cash flows of a forecasted transaction is referred to as a cash flow hedge. The criteria for designating a derivative as a cash flow hedge include the assessment of the instruments effectiveness in risk reduction, matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction, and the assessment of the probability that the underlying transaction will occur. For derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction. Derivatives that we designate as cash flow hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from operating activities. We recognize gains and losses from changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes in the line item on the consolidated statements of income most closely associated with the related exposures, primarily in interest and other, net and gains (losses) on equity investments, net. As part of our strategic investment program, we also acquire equity derivative instruments, such as equity conversion rights associated with debt instruments, that we do not designate as hedging instruments. We recognize the gains or losses from changes in fair value of these equity derivative instruments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Gains and losses from derivatives not designated as hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within cash flows from operating activities.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Measurement of Effectiveness ##TABLE_START   Effectiveness for forwards is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the fair value of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item. For currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to capital purchases, forward points are excluded, and effectiveness is measured using spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item. For currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to operating expenditures, forward points are included and effectiveness is measured using forward rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Effectiveness for options is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of an option instrument representing the hedged risks in the hedged item. Time value is excluded and effectiveness is measured using spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Effectiveness for interest rate swaps and commodity swaps is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the swap with the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item. ##TABLE_END If a cash flow hedge is discontinued because it is no longer probable that the original hedged transaction will occur as previously anticipated, the cumulative unrealized gain or loss on the related derivative is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. Subsequent gains or losses on the related derivative instrument are recognized in interest and other, net in each period until the instrument matures, is terminated, is re-designated as a qualified cash flow hedge, or is sold. Ineffective portions of cash flow hedges, as well as amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, are recognized in earnings in interest and other, net. For further discussion of our derivative instruments and risk management programs, see Note 7: Derivative Financial Instruments. Securities Lending We may enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions, generally to facilitate hedging and certain investment transactions. Selected securities may be loaned, secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investment assets on our consolidated balance sheets. For lending agreements collateralized by cash and cash equivalents, collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. For lending agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the collateral as an asset or a liability, unless the collateral is repledged. Loans Receivable We make loans to third parties that are classified within other current assets or other long-term assets. We may elect the fair value option for loans when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. We record the gains or losses on these loans arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate, currency, and counterparty credit changes, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments, in interest and other, net. Loans that are denominated in U.S. dollars and have a floating-rate coupon are carried at amortized cost. We measure interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method, which is based on the effective yield of the loans rather than the stated coupon rate. For further discussion of our loans receivable, see Note 4: Fair Value. Inventories We compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventories at year-ends were as follows: ##TABLE_START   (In Millions)  2012   2011  Raw materials  $ 478   $ 644  Work in process   2,219    1,680  Finished goods   2,037    1,772       Total inventories  $ 4,734   $ 4,096       ##TABLE_END  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, net at year-ends was as follows: ##TABLE_START   (In Millions)  2012   2011  Land and buildings  $ 18,807   $ 17,883  Machinery and equipment   39,033    34,351  Construction in progress   8,206    5,839       Total property, plant and equipment, gross   66,046    58,073  Less: accumulated depreciation   (38,063 )   (34,446 )      Total property, plant and equipment, net  $ 27,983   $ 23,627       ##TABLE_END We compute depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method. Substantially all of our depreciable property, plant and equipment assets are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment, 2 to 4 years; buildings, 4 to 25 years. We capitalize a majority of interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment. Goodwill We record goodwill when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets as of the date of acquisition, assigning the goodwill to our applicable reporting units based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition. We perform a quarterly review of goodwill for indicators of impairment. During the fourth quarter of each year, we perform an impairment assessment for each reporting unit, and we perform impairment tests using a fair value approach when necessary. The reporting units carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. For further discussion of goodwill, see Note 15: Goodwill. Identified Intangible Assets Licensed technology and patents are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods of benefit. We amortize all acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life based on economic benefit. Acquisition-related in-process research and development assets represent the fair value of incomplete research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition; initially, these are classified as other intangible assets that are not subject to amortization. Assets related to projects that have been completed are transferred from other intangible assets to acquisition-related developed technology; these are subject to amortization, while assets related to projects that have been abandoned are impaired and expensed to research and development. In the quarter following the period in which identified intangible assets become fully amortized, we remove the fully amortized balances from the gross asset and accumulated amortization amounts. The estimated useful life ranges for identified intangible assets that are subject to amortization as of December 29, 2012 are as follows: ##TABLE_START  (In Years)  Estimated Useful Life  Acquisition-related developed technology   313  Acquisition-related customer relationships   58  Acquisition-related trade names   57  Licensed technology and patents   517  ##TABLE_END  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  We perform a quarterly review of finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess recoverability by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If an assets useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinite-lived intangible assets, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If necessary, a quantitative impairment test is performed to compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying value. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. For further discussion of identified intangible assets, see Note 16: Identified Intangible Assets. Product Warranty The vast majority of our products are sold with a limited warranty on product quality and a limited indemnification for customers against intellectual property rights infringement claims related to our products. The accrual and the related expense for known product warranty issues were not significant during the periods presented. Due to product testing, the short time typically between product shipment and the detection and correction of product failures, and the historical rate of payments on indemnification claims, the accrual and related expense for estimated incurred but unidentified issues were not significant during the periods presented. Revenue Recognition We recognize net product revenue when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, delivery has occurred, and acceptance, if applicable, as well as fixed pricing and probable collectibility. We record pricing allowances, including discounts based on contractual arrangements with customers, when we recognize revenue as a reduction to both accounts receivable and net revenue. Because of frequent sales price reductions and rapid technology obsolescence in the industry, we defer product revenue and related costs of sales from component sales made to distributors under agreements allowing price protection or right of return until the distributors sell the merchandise. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. We include shipping charges billed to customers in net revenue, and include the related shipping costs in cost of sales. Revenue from license agreements with our McAfee business generally includes service and support agreements for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period. Revenue derived from online subscription products is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period. Professional services revenue is recognized as services are performed or, if required, upon customer acceptance. For arrangements with multiple elements, including software licenses, maintenance, and/or services, revenue is allocated across the separately identified deliverables and may be recognized or deferred. When vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) does not exist for undelivered elements such as maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Direct costs, such as costs related to revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements associated with license arrangements, as well as component costs associated with product revenue and sales commissions, are deferred and amortized over the same period that the related revenue is recognized. We record deferred revenue offset by the related cost of sales on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred income. Advertising Cooperative advertising programs reimburse customers for marketing activities for certain of our products, subject to defined criteria. We accrue cooperative advertising obligations and record the costs at the same time that the related revenue is recognized. We record cooperative advertising costs as marketing, general and administrative expenses to the extent that an advertising benefit separate from the revenue transaction can be identified and the fair value of that advertising benefit received is determinable. We record any excess in cash paid over the fair value of the advertising benefit received as a reduction in revenue. Advertising costs, including direct marketing costs, recorded within marketing, general and administrative expenses were $2.0 billion in 2012 ($2.1 billion in 2011 and $1.8 billion in 2010).  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Employee Equity Incentive Plans We have employee equity incentive plans, which are described more fully in Note 22: Employee Equity Incentive Plans. We use the straight-line attribution method to recognize share-based compensation over the service period of the award. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock units (RSUs), we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and restricted stock units with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award. Income Tax We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that it is believed more likely than not to be realized. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if that tax position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We then measure the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes. For more information about income taxes, see Note 26: Income Taxes. Note 3: Accounting Changes In the first quarter of 2012, we adopted amended standards that increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. These amended standards eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity, and they require that all changes in stockholders equityexcept investments by, and distributions to, ownersbe presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. Our adoption of these amended standards impacted the presentation of other comprehensive income, as we have elected to present two separate but consecutive statements, but it did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we adopted amended standards to simplify how we test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment; these amended standards improve consistency in impairment testing requirements among long-lived asset categories. The amended standards allow for an assessment of qualitative factors such that we can determine whether the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not to be less than its carrying value. For assets in which this assessment concludes that the fair value is more likely than not to be more than its carrying value, these amended standards eliminate the requirement to perform quantitative impairment testing as outlined in the previously issued standards. Our adoption of these amended standards did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the first quarter of 2011, we adopted new standards for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. These new standards change the determination of whether the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units for accounting purposes. Additionally, these new standards modify the method by which revenue is allocated to the separately identified deliverables. The adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the first quarter of 2011, we adopted new standards that remove certain tangible products and associated software from the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. The adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we adopted amended standards that simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment. These amended standards allow for an assessment of qualitative factors such that we can determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is more likely than not to be less than its carrying value. For reporting units in which this assessment concludes that the fair value is more likely than not to be more than its carrying value, these amended standards eliminate the requirement to perform goodwill impairment testing. Our adoption of these amended standards did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Note 4: Fair Value Assets/Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following types of instruments as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011: ##TABLE_START            December 29, 2012   December 31, 2011     Fair Value Measured and Recorded at Reporting Date Using   Total   Fair Value Measured and Recorded at Reporting Date Using   Total  (In Millions)  Level 1   Level 2   Level 3    Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Assets         Cash equivalents:         Bank deposits  $    $ 822   $    $ 822   $    $ 795   $    $ 795  Commercial paper       2,711        2,711        2,408        2,408  Government bonds   400    66        466    150            150  Money market fund deposits   1,086            1,086    546            546  Reverse repurchase agreements       2,800        2,800        500        500  Short-term investments:         Bank deposits       540        540        196        196  Commercial paper       1,474        1,474        1,409        1,409  Corporate bonds   75    292    21    388    120    428    28    576  Government bonds   1,307    290        1,597    2,690    310        3,000  Trading assets:         Asset-backed securities           68    68            115    115  Bank deposits       247        247        135        135  Commercial paper       336        336        305        305  Corporate bonds   482    1,109        1,591    202    486        688  Government bonds   1,743    1,479        3,222    1,698    1,317        3,015  Money market fund deposits   18            18    49            49  Municipal bonds       203        203        284        284  Other current assets:         Derivative assets   12    208    1    221        159    7    166  Loans receivable       203        203        33        33  Marketable equity securities   4,424            4,424    522    40        562  Other long-term investments:         Asset-backed securities           11    11            36    36  Bank deposits       56        56        55        55  Corporate bonds   10    218    26    254        282    39    321  Government bonds   59    113        172    177    300        477  Other long-term assets:         Derivative assets       20    18    38        34    29    63  Loans receivable       577        577        715        715                   Total assets measured and recorded at fair value  $ 9,616   $ 13,764   $ 145   $ 23,525   $ 6,154   $ 10,191   $ 254   $ 16,599                   Liabilities         Other accrued liabilities:         Derivative liabilities  $ 1   $ 291   $    $ 292   $    $ 280   $ 8   $ 288  Long-term debt                           131    131  Other long-term liabilities:         Derivative liabilities       20        20        27        27                   Total liabilities measured and recorded at fair value  $ 1   $ 311   $    $ 312   $    $ 307   $ 139   $ 446                   ##TABLE_END Government bonds include bonds issued or deemed to be guaranteed by government entities. Government bonds include instruments such as non-U.S. government bonds, U.S. Treasury securities, and U.S. agency securities. The underlying assets of substantially all of our reverse repurchase agreements presented in the preceding table are government bonds.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  During 2012, we transferred approximately $200 million of government bonds and corporate bonds from Level 1 to Level 2, primarily based on the reduced market activity for the underlying securities. Our policy is to reflect transfers in and transfers out at the beginning of the quarter in which a change in circumstances resulted in the transfer. Investments in Debt Instruments Debt investments reflected in the preceding table include investments such as asset-backed securities, bank deposits, commercial paper, corporate bonds, government bonds, money market fund deposits, municipal bonds, and reverse repurchase agreements classified as cash equivalents. When we use observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less-active markets, we classify our debt investments as Level 2. When observable market prices for identical securities are not available, we price our debt investments using non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data; quoted market prices for similar instruments; or pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers. These valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding and binding broker quotes; observable market prices for identical or similar securities; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and, to a lesser degree, unobservable market inputs. We corroborate non-binding market consensus prices with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exists. The discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs, such as LIBOR-based yield curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings. Debt investments that are classified as Level 3 are classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. When observable market data is not available, we corroborate our fair value measurements using non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes from a second source. Fair Value Option for Loans Receivable We elected the fair value option for loans made to third parties when the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk was hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. As of December 29, 2012, the fair value of our loans receivable for which we elected the fair value option did not significantly differ from the contractual principal balance based on the contractual currency. Loans receivable are classified within other current assets and other long-term assets. Fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Gains and losses from changes in fair value on the loans receivable and related derivative instruments, as well as interest income, are recorded in interest and other, net. During all periods presented, changes in the fair value of our loans receivable were largely offset by changes in the related derivative instruments, resulting in an insignificant net impact on our consolidated statements of income. Gains and losses attributable to changes in credit risk are determined using observable credit default spreads for the issuer or comparable companies; these gains and losses were insignificant during all periods presented. We did not elect the fair value option for loans when the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk was not hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis Our non-marketable equity investments (non-marketable equity method and cost method investments) and non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. A portion of our non-marketable equity investments has been measured and recorded at fair value due to events or circumstances that significantly impacted the fair value of those investments, resulting in other-than-temporary impairment charges. We classified these investments as Level 3, as we used unobservable inputs to the valuation methodologies that were significant to the fair value measurements, and the valuations required management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices. Impairment charges recognized on non-marketable equity investments held as of December 29, 2012 were $68 million during 2012 ($62 million during 2011 on non-marketable equity investments held as of December 31, 2011 and $121 million during 2010 on non-marketable equity investments held as of December 25, 2010). The fair value of the non-marketable equity investments impaired during 2012 was $73 million at the time of impairment ($69 million and $128 million for non-marketable equity investments impaired during 2011 and 2010, respectively).  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis We measure the fair value of our non-marketable cost method investments, indebtedness carried at amortized cost, cost method loans receivable, and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months quarterly; however, the assets are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. The carrying amounts and fair values of certain financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 were as follows: ##TABLE_START         2012     Carrying Amount   Fair Value Measured Using   Fair Value  (In Millions)   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Non-marketable cost method investments  $ 1,202   $    $    $ 1,766   $ 1,766  Loans receivable  $ 199   $    $ 150   $ 48   $ 198  Reverse repurchase agreements  $ 50   $    $ 50   $    $ 50  Long-term debt  $ 13,136   $ 11,442   $ 2,926   $    $ 14,368  Short-term debt  $ 48   $    $ 48   $    $ 48  NVIDIA Corporation cross-license agreement liability  $ 875   $    $ 890   $    $ 890  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START         2011     Carrying Amount   Fair Value Measured Using   Fair Value  (In Millions)   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Non-marketable cost method investments  $ 1,129   $    $    $ 1,861   $ 1,861  Loans receivable  $ 132   $    $ 132   $    $ 132  Long-term debt  $ 6,953   $ 5,287   $ 2,448   $    $ 7,735  Short-term debt  $ 200   $    $ 200   $    $ 200  NVIDIA Corporation cross-license agreement liability  $ 1,156   $    $ 1,174   $    $ 1,174  ##TABLE_END  As of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the unrealized loss position of our non-marketable cost method investments was insignificant. Our non-marketable cost method investments are valued using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of relevant factors, including comparable companies sizes, growth rates, industries, and development stages. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates for investees revenue, costs, and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenues and costs are developed using available market, historical, and forecast data. The valuation of these non-marketable cost method investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, the investees capital structure, the terms of the investees issued interests, and the lack of marketability of the investments. The carrying amount and fair value of loans receivable exclude loans measured and recorded at a fair value of $780 million as of December 29, 2012 ($748 million as of December 31, 2011). The carrying amount and fair value of long-term debt exclude long-term debt measured and recorded at a fair value of $131 million as of December 31, 2011. Short-term debt includes our commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2011, and the carrying amount and fair value exclude drafts payable. The fair value of our loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreements, including those held at fair value, is determined using a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data, such as LIBOR-based yield curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings. The credit quality of these assets remains high, with credit ratings of A/A2 or better for most of our loans receivable and all of our reverse repurchase agreements as of December 29, 2012. Our long-term debt recognized at amortized cost comprises our senior notes and our convertible debentures. The fair value of our senior notes is determined using active market prices, and it is therefore classified as Level 1. The fair value of our convertible long-term debt is determined using discounted cash flow models with observable market inputs, and it takes into consideration variables such as interest rate changes, comparable securities, subordination discount, and credit-rating changes. The NVIDIA Corporation cross-license agreement liability in the preceding table was incurred as a result of entering into a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA in January 2011. We agreed to make payments to NVIDIA over six years. As of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the carrying amount of the liability arising from the agreement was classified within other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, as applicable. The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model, which discounts future cash flows using our incremental borrowing rates.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Note 5: Trading Assets As of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, all of our trading assets were marketable debt instruments. Net gains related to trading assets still held at the reporting date were $16 million in 2012 (net losses of $71 million and $50 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively). Net gains on the related derivatives and intercompany loans were $11 million in 2012 (net gains of $58 million and $43 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively). Note 6: Available-for-Sale Investments and Cash Equivalents Available-for-sale investments and cash equivalents as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 were as follows: ##TABLE_START            2012   2011  (In Millions)  Adjusted Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Adjusted Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value  Asset-backed securities  $ 14   $    $ (3 )  $ 11   $ 48   $    $ (12 )  $ 36  Bank deposits   1,417    1        1,418    1,046    1    (1 )   1,046  Commercial paper   4,184    1        4,185    3,820        (3 )   3,817  Corporate bonds   635    8    (1 )   642    892    14    (9 )   897  Government bonds   2,235            2,235    3,631        (4 )   3,627  Marketable equity securities   3,356    1,069    (1 )   4,424    189    385    (12 )   562  Money market fund deposits   1,086            1,086    546            546                   Total available-for-sale investments  $ 12,927   $ 1,079   $ (5 )  $ 14,001   $ 10,172   $ 400   $ (41 )  $ 10,531                   Reverse repurchase agreements   2,800      2,800    500      500               Total available-for-sale investments and cash equivalents  $ 15,727   $ 1,079   $ (5 )  $ 16,801   $ 10,672   $ 400   $ (41 )  $ 11,031                   ##TABLE_END  In the preceding table, government bonds include bonds issued or deemed to be guaranteed by government entities. Government bonds include instruments such as U.S. Treasury securities, non-U.S. government obligations, and U.S. agency securities as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Bank deposits were primarily issued by institutions outside the U.S. as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011. During the third quarter of 2012, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML Holding N.V. intended to accelerate the development of 450-millimeter (mm) wafer technology and extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography. The agreements include our purchase of ASML equity securities totaling $3.2 billion completed in the third quarter of 2012. This equity interest has been accounted for as an available-for-sale investment and is included in marketable equity securities in the preceding table. Intels ownership interest in ASML was 15% of ASMLs issued shares as of December 29, 2012 and is subject to lock-up and voting restrictions. We also agreed to provide research and development (RD) funding totaling  829 million (approximately $1.0 billion as of the date of the agreement) over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from ASML. The agreements set forth terms to determine pricing as well as milestones related to 450mm and EUV development and production tool deliveries. In exchange for making this early commitment, we will receive credits to be applied to future tool purchases from ASML. The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale debt investments as of December 29, 2012, by contractual maturity, were as follows: ##TABLE_START   (In Millions)  Cost   Fair Value  Due in 1 year or less  $ 7,995   $ 7,999  Due in 12 years   409    413  Due in 25 years   67    68  Instruments not due at a single maturity date   1,100    1,097       Total  $ 9,571   $ 9,577       ##TABLE_END Instruments not due at a single maturity date in the preceding table include asset-backed securities and money market fund deposits.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  We sold available-for-sale investments for proceeds of $2.3 billion in 2012 ($9.1 billion in 2011 and $475 million in 2010). Substantially all of the proceeds in 2011 were from debt investments primarily used to fund our acquisition of McAfee. The gross realized gains on sales of available-for-sale investments were $166 million in 2012 ($268 million in 2011 and $160 million in 2010) and were primarily related to our sales of marketable equity securities. We determine the cost of an investment sold on an average cost basis at the individual security level. Impairment charges recognized on available-for-sale investments were $36 million in 2012 ($73 million in 2011 and insignificant in 2010). Note 7: Derivative Financial Instruments Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk and commodity price risk. We currently do not hold derivative instruments for the purpose of managing credit risk as we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty and generally enter into derivative transactions with high-credit-quality counterparties. We also enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. For presentation on our consolidated balance sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to currency exchange rate risk and generally hedge our exposures with currency forward contracts, currency interest rate swaps, or currency options. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, and the Israeli shekel. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. Our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable are generally hedged with offsetting currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. We may also hedge foreign currency risk arising from funding foreign currency denominated forecasted investments. These programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. Our currency risk management programs include: ##TABLE_START   Currency derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize currency forward contracts and currency options to hedge exposures to the variability in the U.S.-dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S.-dollar-denominated cash flows. These instruments generally mature within 12 months. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and we reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Currency derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities, non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets, and hedges of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated loans receivable recognized at fair value. The majority of these instruments mature within 12 months. Changes in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of the underlying assets and liabilities are approximately offset by the changes in fair value of the related derivatives. We record net gains or losses in the line item on the consolidated statements of income most closely associated with the related exposures, primarily in interest and other, net, except for equity-related gains or losses, which we primarily record in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END Interest Rate Risk Our primary objective for holding investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields. We generally swap the returns on our investments in fixed-rate debt instruments with remaining maturities longer than six months into U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns, unless management specifically approves otherwise. These swaps are settled at various interest payment times involving cash payments at each interest and principal payment date, with the majority of the contracts having quarterly payments.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Our interest rate risk management programs include: ##TABLE_START   Interest rate derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest characteristics of debt instruments. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and we reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Interest rate derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize interest rate swaps and currency interest rate swaps in economic hedging transactions, including hedges of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets and hedges of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated loans receivable recognized at fair value. Floating interest rates on the swaps are reset on a quarterly basis. Changes in fair value of the debt instruments classified as trading assets and hedges of loans receivable recognized at fair value are generally offset by changes in fair value of the related derivatives, both of which are recorded in interest and other, net. ##TABLE_END Equity Market Risk Our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities; however, for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments, we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks. In addition, for our securities that we no longer consider strategic, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk. Our equity market risk management program includes equity derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives. We recognize changes in the fair value of such derivatives in gains (losses) on equity investments, net.  We also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains and losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the gains and losses on the related liabilities, both of which are recorded in cost of sales and operating expenses. The deferred compensation liabilities were $859 million as of December 29, 2012 ($700 million as of December 31, 2011) and are included in other accrued liabilities. In 2010, we sold our ownership interest in Numonyx B.V. to Micron Technology, Inc. for consideration consisting of shares of Micron. We also entered into equity option transactions that economically hedged a portion of the ownership interest in Micron that we acquired. In the second quarter of 2011, we sold our remaining ownership interest in Micron and the related equity options matured. Commodity Price Risk We operate facilities that consume commodities and have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices, such as those for natural gas. These programs reduce, but do not always eliminate, the impact of commodity price movements. Our commodity price risk management program includes commodity derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize commodity swap contracts to hedge future cash flow exposures to the variability in commodity prices. These instruments generally mature within 12 months. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain (loss) from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Volume of Derivative Activity Total gross notional amounts for outstanding derivatives (recorded at fair value) as of December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    (In Millions)  2012   2011   2010  Currency forwards  $ 13,117   $ 11,203   $ 8,502  Currency interest rate swaps   2,711    1,650    2,259  Embedded debt derivatives   3,600    3,600    3,600  Equity options   17    54    496  Interest rate swaps   1,101    1,837    2,166  Total return swaps   807    761    627  Other   110    128    160         Total  $ 21,463   $ 19,233   $ 17,810         ##TABLE_END  The gross notional amounts for currency forwards and currency interest rate swaps (presented by currency) as of December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    (In Millions)  2012   2011   2010  British pound sterling  $ 308   $ 459   $ 424  Chinese yuan   647    688    347  Euro   5,994    3,904    4,351  Israeli shekel   2,256    2,168    1,191  Japanese yen   4,389    3,477    3,440  Malaysian ringgit   442    805    382  Other   1,792    1,352    626         Total  $ 15,828   $ 12,853   $ 10,761         ##TABLE_END Fair Value of Derivative Instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets The fair value of our derivative instruments as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was as follows: ##TABLE_START            2012   2011  (In Millions)  Other Current Assets   Other Long-Term Assets   Other Accrued Liabilities   Other Long-Term Liabilities   Other Current Assets   Other Long-Term Assets   Other Accrued Liabilities   Other Long-Term Liabilities  Derivatives designated as hedging instruments         Currency forwards  $ 91   $ 2   $ 127   $    $ 61   $    $ 170   $ 7  Other                           1                       Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments  $ 91   $ 2   $ 127   $    $ 61   $    $ 171   $ 7                   Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments         Currency forwards  $ 85   $    $ 58   $    $ 54   $    $ 34   $   Currency interest rate swaps   33    18    72    14    41    33    11    10  Embedded debt derivatives               6                10  Equity options   1    1    1            6    9      Interest rate swaps           34        3        63      Total return swaps   11                7              Other       17                24                           Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments  $ 130   $ 36   $ 165   $ 20   $ 105   $ 63   $ 117   $ 20                   Total derivatives  $ 221   $ 38   $ 292   $ 20   $ 166   $ 63   $ 288   $ 27                   ##TABLE_END  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships The before-tax effects of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships for the three years ended December 29, 2012 were as follows: ##TABLE_START           Gains (Losses) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives (Effective Portion)   Gains (Losses) Reclassified from Accumulated OCI into Income by Derivative Instrument Type (Effective Portion)  (In Millions)  2012   2011   2010   Location  2012   2011   2010  Currency forwards  $ 4   $ 20   $ 66   Cost of sales  $ 11   $ 118   $ 49       Research and development   (63 )   20    27       Marketing, general and administrative   (25 )   19    4  Other   9        4   Cost of sales   (2 )   4    (2 )               Total  $ 13   $ 20   $ 70    $ (79 )  $ 161   $ 78                ##TABLE_END  Gains and losses on derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships related to hedge ineffectiveness and amounts excluded from effectiveness testing were insignificant during all periods presented in the preceding tables. We estimate that we will reclassify approximately $33 million (before taxes) of net derivative gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings within the next 12 months. For all periods presented, there was an insignificant impact on results of operations from discontinued cash flow hedges as a result of forecasted transactions that were not probable to occur. Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The effects of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of income for the three years ended December 29, 2012 were as follows: ##TABLE_START     (In Millions)  Location of Gains (Losses) Recognized in Income on Derivatives  2012   2011   2010  Currency forwards  Interest and other, net  $ 3   $ 58   $ 72  Currency interest rate swaps  Interest and other, net   (71 )   (17 )   74  Equity options  Gains (losses) on equity investments, net   (1 )   (67 )   59  Interest rate swaps  Interest and other, net   31    (26 )   (59 ) Total return swaps  Various   77    (13 )   70  Other  Gains (losses) on equity investments, net   (7 )   4    (2 ) Other  Interest and other, net   3        (1 )         Total  $ 35   $ (61 )  $ 213          ##TABLE_END Note 8: Concentrations of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, derivative financial instruments, loans receivable, and trade receivables. When possible, we enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. For presentation on our consolidated balance sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterpartys relative credit standing. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in A/A2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated AA-/Aa3 or better. Our investment policy requires substantially all investments with original maturities at the time of investment of up to six months to be rated at least A-2/P-2 by Standard  Poors/Moodys, and specifies a higher minimum rating for investments with longer maturities. For instance, investments with maturities of greater than three years generally require a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3 at the time of investment. Government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, or the absence of A rated counterparties in certain countries, result in some minor exceptions. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterpartys obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  December 29, 2012, our total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding U.S. and Japan government bonds, did not exceed $750 million. We obtain and secure available collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions, when we deem it appropriate. A substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers. We also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and retail distributors. Our three largest customers accounted for 43% of net revenue for 2012, 43% of net revenue for 2011, and 46% of net revenue for 2010. Additionally, these three largest customers accounted for 33% of our accounts receivable as of December 29, 2012 and 36% of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2011. We believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe that credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis, and from this analysis, we establish credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee or standby letter of credit, or obtaining credit insurance. Note 9: Other Long-Term Assets Other long-term assets as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   (In Millions)  2012   2011  Equity method investments  $ 992   $ 1,669  Non-marketable cost method investments   1,202    1,129  Non-current deferred tax assets   358    335  Loans receivable   644    715  Other   952    800       Total other long-term assets  $ 4,148   $ 4,648       ##TABLE_END Note 10: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments Equity Method Investments Equity method investments are classified within other long-term assets and as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 were as follows: ##TABLE_START        2012   2011  (Dollars In Millions)  Carrying Value   Ownership Percentage   Carrying Value   Ownership Percentage  IM Flash Technologies, LLC  $ 642    49 %  $ 863    49 % Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC   146    50 %   167    50 % SMART Technologies, Inc.   25    14 %   37    14 % Clearwire Communications, LLC       6 %       7 % IM Flash Singapore, LLP        %   466    18 % Other equity method investments   179     136          Total  $ 992    $ 1,669          ##TABLE_END  IM Flash Technologies, LLC and IM Flash Singapore, LLP Micron and Intel formed IMFT and IMFS to manufacture NAND flash memory products for Micron and Intel. During the second quarter of 2012, we entered into agreements with Micron to modify our joint venture relationship. Under the agreements and as of December 29, 2012, we own a 49% interest in the remaining assets held by IMFT and no longer hold an ownership interest in IMFS. We received $605 million in the second quarter of 2012 from the sale of assets of IMFS and certain assets of IMFT to Micron, which is reflected as a sale of assets within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  As part of the agreements to modify our joint venture relationship, we also entered into an amended operating agreement for IMFT. This amended operating agreement extends the term of IMFT to 2024, unless earlier terminated under certain terms and conditions, and provides that IMFT may manufacture certain emerging memory technologies in addition to NAND flash memory. These agreements include a supply agreement for Micron to supply us with NAND flash memory products. We provided approximately $365 million to Micron in the second quarter of 2012, primarily for subsequent product purchases under the supply agreement with Micron. A substantial majority of this $365 million is reflected as a cash flow used for operating activities. The agreements also extend our NAND joint development program with Micron and expand it to include emerging memory technologies. Additionally, the amended agreement provides for certain rights that, beginning in 2015, will enable us to sell to Micron, or enable Micron to purchase from us, our interest in IMFT. If Intel exercises this right, Micron would set the closing date of the transaction within two years following such election and could elect to receive financing from Intel for one to two years. The closing of the joint venture expansion did not have an impact on our consolidated statements of income. These joint ventures are variable interest entities. All costs of the IMFT joint venture will be passed on to Micron and Intel through our purchase agreements. Our portion of IMFT and IMFS costs, primarily related to product purchases and production-related services, was approximately $705 million during 2012 (approximately $985 million during 2011 and approximately $795 million during 2010). Subsequent to the sale of our ownership interest in IMFS in the second quarter of 2012, we no longer incur costs related to IMFS. The amount due to IMFT for product purchases and services provided was approximately $90 million as of December 29, 2012 (approximately $125 million as of December 31, 2011 due to IMFT and IMFS). During 2012, IMFT returned $137 million to us, which is reflected as a return of equity method investment within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows ($263 million during 2011 and $197 million during 2010). IMFT depends on Micron and Intel for any additional cash requirements. Our known maximum exposure to loss approximated the carrying value of our investment balance in IMFT as of December 29, 2012. Except for the amount due to IMFT for product purchases and services, we did not have any additional liabilities recognized on our consolidated balance sheets in connection with our interest in this joint venture as of December 29, 2012. In addition, our potential future losses could be higher than the carrying amount of our investment, as Intel and Micron are liable for other future operating costs or obligations of IMFT. Future cash calls could also increase our investment balance and the related exposure to loss. In addition, as we are currently committed to purchasing 49% of IMFTs production output and production-related services, we may be required to purchase products at a cost in excess of realizable value. Under the accounting standards for consolidating variable interest entities, the consolidating investor is the entity with the power to direct the activities of the venture that most significantly impact the ventures economic performance and with the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the venture that could potentially be significant to the venture. We have determined that we do not have both of these characteristics; therefore, we have accounted for our interest in IMFT and our prior interest in IMFS using the equity method of accounting. Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC In the first quarter of 2011, Intel and General Electric Company (GE) formed Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC (Care Innovations), an equally owned joint venture in the healthcare industry, that focuses on independent living and delivery of health-related services by means of telecommunications. The company was formed by combining assets of GE Healthcares Home Health division and Intels Digital Health Group. As a result of forming Care Innovations, we recognized a gain of $164 million in the first quarter of 2011 that was recorded in interest and other, net. Care Innovations depends on Intel and GE for any additional cash requirements; therefore, it is a variable interest entity. Our known maximum exposure to loss approximated the carrying value of our investment balance in Care Innovations as of December 29, 2012. Intel and GE equally share the power to direct all of Care Innovations activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. As a result, we account for our interest in Care Innovations under the equity method of accounting. SMART Technologies, Inc. We hold an equity interest in SMART Technologies, Inc. and account for our interest using the equity method of accounting. In 2010, SMART completed an initial public offering of shares approved for listing on The NASDAQ Global Select Market*. We sold approximately 10 million of our 27.5 million shares in the secondary offering. We recognized a gain of $181 million in 2010 on the initial public offering and subsequent sale of our shares in the secondary offering, which is included in gains (losses) on equity investments, net.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Clearwire Communications, LLC In 2008, we invested in Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC). We recognized our proportionate share of losses to the extent that our investment had a positive carrying value. We recognized equity method losses of $145 million in 2011 and $116 million in 2010, which are included in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Numonyx B.V. In 2008, we divested our NOR flash memory business in exchange for an ownership interest in Numonyx. During 2010, we recognized $42 million of equity method gains within gains (losses) on equity investments, net. During the second quarter of 2010, we sold our ownership interest in Numonyx to Micron and recognized a gain on the sale of $91 million, which is included in gains (losses) on equity investments, net.

For further information, see Note 10: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments. Note 13: Acquisitions 2012 Acquisitions During 2012, we completed 15 acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate net cash consideration of $638 million. Substantially all of the consideration was allocated to goodwill and acquisition-related developed technology intangible assets. For information on the assignment of goodwill to our operating segments for our acquisitions, see Note 15: Goodwill, and for information on the classification of intangible assets, see Note 16: Identified Intangible Assets. The completed acquisitions in 2012, both individually and in the aggregate, were not significant to our consolidated results of operations.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  2011 Acquisitions McAfee, Inc. On February 28, 2011, we completed the acquisition of McAfee by acquiring all issued and outstanding common shares in exchange for cash. The acquired company continues to operate as McAfee and offers products for endpoint security, network and content security, risk and compliance, and consumer and mobile security. In addition to managing the existing McAfee business, the objective of the acquisition was to accelerate and enhance Intels combination of hardware and software security solutions, thereby improving the overall security of our platforms. Total consideration to acquire McAfee was $6.7 billion (net of $943 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired) and comprised the following: ##TABLE_START  (In Millions)     Cash  $ 6,652  Share-based awards assumed   48     Total  $ 6,700     ##TABLE_END The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major class in the acquisition of McAfee was recognized as follows: ##TABLE_START  (In Millions)     Marketable debt securities  $ 329  Goodwill   4,299  Identified intangible assets   3,552  Deferred tax assets   738  Other assets   417  Deferred income   (1,049 ) Deferred tax liabilities   (1,191 ) Other liabilities   (395 )    Total  $ 6,700     ##TABLE_END The goodwill of $4.3 billion arising from the acquisition is primarily attributed to synergies to enable a single company to combine security and hardware for the protection of online devices, as well as the assembled workforce of McAfee. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is not deductible for tax purposes. For information on the assignment of goodwill to our operating segments for the acquisition, see Note 15: Goodwill. The identified intangible assets assumed in the acquisition of McAfee were recognized as follows based upon their fair value as of February 28, 2011: ##TABLE_START      Fair Value (In Millions)   Estimated Useful Life (In Years)  Developed technology  $ 1,221    4  Customer relationships   1,418    27      Total identified intangible assets subject to amortization  $ 2,639   In-process research and development   92   Trade names   821       Total identified intangible assets  $ 3,552       ##TABLE_END Acquired developed technology represents the fair value of McAfee products that have reached technological feasibility and were part of McAfees product offerings at the date of acquisition. Customer relationships represent the fair value of the underlying relationships and agreements with McAfees customers. In-process research and development represents the fair value of incomplete McAfee research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition. Incremental costs incurred for those projects are expensed as incurred in research and development. Since the acquisition was completed, most of the projects have been completed and the associated costs are being amortized. Trade names are indefinite-lived intangible assets and represent the fair value of brand and name recognition associated with the marketing of McAfees products and services.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Other 2011 Acquisitions During 2011, in addition to the McAfee acquisition, we completed 13 acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for total consideration of $2.1 billion, substantially all cash consideration. Total net cash consideration to acquire the Wireless Solutions (WLS) business of Infineon Technologies AG, which operates as Intel Mobile Communications, was $1.4 billion. The WLS business offers mobile phone components such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers, and power management integrated circuits. In addition to managing the existing WLS business, the objective of the acquisition was to provide solutions that enable wireless connectivity for a broad range of computing applications. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major class in the acquisitions completed during 2011, excluding McAfee, was allocated as follows: ##TABLE_START  (In Millions)     Fair value of net tangible assets acquired  $ 206  Goodwill   517  Identified intangible assets   1,409     Total  $ 2,132     ##TABLE_END For information on the assignment of goodwill to our operating segments for the acquisitions, see Note 15: Goodwill. The identified intangible assets assumed in the acquisitions completed during 2011, excluding McAfee, were recognized as follows: ##TABLE_START      Fair Value (In Millions)   Estimated Useful Life (In Years)  Developed technology  $ 1,102    39  Customer relationships   144    58  Other intangible assets   44    27      Total identified intangible assets subject to amortization  $ 1,290   In-process research and development   119       Total identified intangible assets  $ 1,409       ##TABLE_END Acquired developed technology represents the fair value of the acquirees products that have reached technological feasibility and are a part of the acquirees product lines at the time acquired. Customer relationships represent the fair value of the underlying relationships and agreements with the acquirees customers. In-process research and development represents the fair value of incomplete research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition. In the future, the fair value of each project at the acquisition date will be either amortized or impaired, depending on whether the project is completed or abandoned. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we performed an impairment analysis that determined that the carrying value of certain acquired in-process research and development was fully impaired, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $21 million. Actual and Pro Forma Results of Acquirees Net revenue and net income attributable to acquisitions completed during 2011 have been included in our consolidated statements of income from their respective acquisition dates. The acquisitions completed during 2011 were not individually significant to our consolidated results of operations; however, they were significant in the aggregate. During 2011, the results of the businesses acquired in 2011 contributed approximately $3.6 billion to our net revenue and reduced our net income by approximately $275 million; substantially all of these impacts were attributable to McAfee and Intel Mobile Communications (IMC) and include the impacts of the amortization of acquired identified intangible assets. McAfee is a non-reportable operating segment and is aggregated with similar non-reportable operating segments within the software and services operating segments category for segment reporting purposes. IMC is a non-reportable operating segment and is aggregated with similar non-reportable operating segments within the other Intel architecture operating segments category for segment reporting purposes. For further information, see Note 28: Operating Segment and Geographic Information. The unaudited pro forma financial results for 2011 and 2010 combine the historical results of Intel for 2011 and 2010, respectively, along with the historical results of the businesses acquired during 2011 for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The results include the effects of pro forma adjustments as if businesses acquired in 2011 were acquired on December 27, 2009. The 2010 pro forma results include a non-recurring adjustment of $307 million, which reduces net income due to the revaluation of McAfees historic deferred revenue to fair value.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  The unaudited pro forma financial results presented below do not include any anticipated synergies or other expected benefits of the acquisitions. This is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of future operations or results that would have been achieved had the acquisitions been completed as of December 27, 2009. ##TABLE_START   (In Millions, Except Per Share AmountsUnaudited)  2011   2010  Net revenue  $ 54,738   $ 47,350  Net income  $ 13,028   $ 11,190  Diluted earnings per share  $ 2.41   $ 1.96  ##TABLE_END 2010 Acquisitions During 2010, we completed three business acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate net cash consideration of $218 million. Substantially all of the consideration was allocated to goodwill and acquisition-related developed technology intangible assets. The completed acquisitions in 2010, both individually and in the aggregate, were not significant to our consolidated results of operations. Note 14: Divestitures In the first quarter of 2011, we completed the divestiture of our Digital Health Group by entering into an agreement with GE to form an equally owned joint venture to create a new healthcare company focused on independent living and delivery of health-related services via telecommunications. The new company, Care Innovations, was formed by combining assets of GE Healthcares Home Health division and Intels Digital Health Group. During the first quarter of 2011, as a result of the formation of Care Innovations, we recognized a gain of $164 million, within interest and other, net. For further information, see Note 10: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments. Note 15: Goodwill Goodwill activity for the years ended December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was as follows: ##TABLE_START      (In Millions)  PC Client Group   Data Center Group   Other Intel Architecture Operating Segments   Software and Services Operating Segments   Total  December 25, 2010  $ 2,234   $ 1,459   $ 582   $ 256   $ 4,531  Additions due to McAfee acquisition   746            3,553    4,299  Additions due to other acquisitions   24    94    176    223    517  Transfers   (86 )       86          Effect of exchange rate fluctuations               (93 )   (93 )            December 31, 2011  $ 2,918   $ 1,553   $ 844   $ 3,939   $ 9,254  Additions due to other acquisitions   44    286    78    44    452  Impairments           (6 )       (6 ) Effect of exchange rate fluctuations               10    10             December 29, 2012  $ 2,962   $ 1,839   $ 916   $ 3,993   $ 9,710             ##TABLE_END  We completed the acquisition of McAfee during the first quarter of 2011. The goodwill recognized from this acquisition was allocated between the McAfee operating segment and our PC Client Group based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition, which reflected the estimated synergistic value generated within the PC Client Group from incorporating McAfees security expertise, reputation, and customer base. The goodwill recognized from our other acquisitions during 2011 was allocated to McAfee, the Software and Services Group, Intel Mobile Communications, the Data Center Group, the Phone Group (formerly the Ultra-Mobility Group), and the PC Client Group. McAfee and the Software and Services Group are included in the software and services operating segments category in the preceding table, while Intel Mobile Communications and the Phone Group are included in the other Intel architecture operating segments category. For further information about our acquisitions during 2011 see Note 13: Acquisitions.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  During the first quarter of 2011, we formed the Netbook and Tablet Group, which included platforms designed for the netbook and tablet market segments and was included in the other Intel architecture operating segments. Due to the formation of this new operating segment, goodwill was transferred from our PC Client Group to the Netbook and Tablet Group. In 2012, we reorganized and allocated goodwill from the Netbook and Tablet Group into three operating segments: Netbook Group, Tablet Group, and Service Provider Group. These three new operating segments are included in the other Intel architecture operating segments. Additionally, the former Ultra-Mobility Group is now the Phone Group. For further information see Note 28: Operating Segments and Geographic Information. During the fourth quarters of 2012, 2011, and 2010, we completed our annual impairment assessments and we concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years. The accumulated impairment losses as of December 29, 2012 were $719 million: $341 million associated with our PC Client Group, $279 million associated with our Data Center Group, and $99 million associated with other Intel architecture operating segments. Note 16: Identified Intangible Assets Identified intangible assets consisted of the following as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011: ##TABLE_START       December 29, 2012  (In Millions)  Gross Assets   Accumulated Amortization   Net  Acquisition-related developed technology  $ 2,778   $ (1,116 )  $ 1,662  Acquisition-related customer relationships   1,712    (551 )   1,161  Acquisition-related trade names   68    (33 )   35  Licensed technology and patents   2,986    (699 )   2,287  Other intangible assets   238    (86 )   152         Identified intangible assets subject to amortization  $ 7,782   $ (2,485 )  $ 5,297  Acquisition-related trade names   809        809  Other intangible assets   129        129         Identified intangible assets not subject to amortization  $ 938   $    $ 938         Total identified intangible assets  $ 8,720   $ (2,485 )  $ 6,235         ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    (In Millions)  December 31, 2011   Gross Assets   Accumulated Amortization   Net  Acquisition-related developed technology  $ 2,615   $ (570 )  $ 2,045  Acquisition-related customer relationships   1,714    (254 )   1,460  Acquisition-related trade names   68    (21 )   47  Licensed technology and patents   2,395    (707 )   1,688         Identified intangible assets subject to amortization  $ 6,792   $ (1,552 )  $ 5,240  Acquisition-related trade names   806        806  Other intangible assets   221        221         Identified intangible assets not subject to amortization   1,027   $    $ 1,027         Total identified intangible assets  $ 7,819   $ (1,552 )  $ 6,267         ##TABLE_END  As a result of our acquisitions in 2012, we recorded acquisition-related developed technology of $168 million with a weighted average life of 10 years. During 2012, we purchased licensed technology and patents of $815 million with a weighted average useful life of nine years, including wireless patents purchased from InterDigital, Inc. for $375 million to be amortized over approximately 10 years. Additionally, we recorded other intangible assets subject to amortization of $238 million associated with customer relationships, which will be amortized over four years. As a result of our acquisition of McAfee during the first quarter of 2011, we recorded $3.6 billion of identified intangible assets. In addition, as a result of our other acquisitions during 2011, we recorded $1.4 billion of identified intangible assets, the substantial majority of which was from the acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  In January 2011, we entered into a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA. Under the agreement, we received a license to all of NVIDIAs patents with a capture period that runs through March 2017 while NVIDIA products are licensed to our patents, subject to exclusions for x86 products, certain chipsets, and certain flash memory technology products. The agreement also included settlement of the existing litigation between the companies, as well as broad mutual general releases. We agreed to make payments totaling $1.5 billion to NVIDIA over six years ($300 million in each of January 2011, 2012, and 2013; and $200 million in each of January 2014, 2015, and 2016), which resulted in a liability totaling approximately $1.4 billion, on a discounted basis. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we recognized an expense of $100 million related to the litigation settlement. In the first quarter of 2011, we recognized the remaining amount of $1.3 billion as licensed technology, which will be amortized into cost of sales over its estimated useful life of 17 years. The initial recognition of the intangible asset and associated liability for future payments to NVIDIA is treated as a non-cash transaction and, therefore, has no impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Future payments will be treated as cash used for financing activities. As of December 29, 2012, the remaining liability of $875 million is classified within other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, based on the expected timing of the underlying payments. We recorded amortization expense on the consolidated statements of income as follows: amortization of acquisition-related developed technology and licensed technology and patents is included in cost of sales, amortization of acquisition-related customer relationships and trade names is included in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and amortization of other intangible assets is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Amortization expenses for the three years ended December 29, 2012 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    (In Millions)  2012   2011   2010  Acquisition-related developed technology  $ 557   $ 482   $ 65  Acquisition-related customer relationships  $ 296   $ 250   $ 10  Acquisition-related trade names  $ 12   $ 10   $ 8  Licensed technology and patents  $ 214   $ 181   $ 157  Other intangible assets  $ 86   $    $   ##TABLE_END Based on identified intangible assets that are subject to amortization as of December 29, 2012, we expect future amortization expense to be as follows: ##TABLE_START      (In Millions)  2013   2014   2015   2016   2017  Acquisition-related developed technology  $ 552   $ 530   $ 254   $ 167   $ 47  Acquisition-related customer relationships  $ 275   $ 261   $ 244   $ 226   $ 134  Acquisition-related trade names  $ 11   $ 10   $ 9   $ 4   $ 1  Licensed technology and patents  $ 274   $ 264   $ 248   $ 234   $ 196  Other intangible assets  $ 104   $ 9   $ 39   $    $   ##TABLE_END Note 17: Deferred Income Deferred income at the end of each period was as follows: ##TABLE_START   (In Millions)  Dec. 29, 2012   Dec. 31, 2011  Deferred income on shipments of components to distributors  $ 694   $ 751  Deferred income from software and services operating segments   1,238    1,178       Current deferred income  $ 1,932   $ 1,929  Non-current deferred income from software and services operating segments   473    460       Total deferred income  $ 2,405   $ 2,389       ##TABLE_END We classify non-current deferred income from the software and services operating segments in other long-term liabilities.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Note 18: Chipset Design Issue  In January 2011, as part of our ongoing quality assurance procedures, we identified a design issue with the Intel  6 Series Express Chipset family (formerly code-named Cougar Point). The issue affected chipsets sold in the fourth quarter of 2010 and January 2011. We subsequently implemented a silicon fix and began shipping the updated version of the affected chipset in February 2011. The total cost to repair and replace affected materials and systems, located with customers and in the market, was $733 million. We recorded a charge of $311 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, which comprised $67 million in product costs for the affected chipsets and $244 million to establish a product accrual for this issue. We recognized a charge of $343 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily related to an additional product accrual for the estimated costs to repair and replace affected materials and systems associated with products sold subsequent to December 25, 2010. In the second quarter of 2011, we recognized an additional $79 million charge as we finalized agreements with customers for reimbursement to repair and replace affected materials and systems. We do not expect to have any significant future adjustments to our estimate. The charges incurred in 2011 and 2010 are reflected in the results of the PC Client Group operating segment. As of December 29, 2012, an insignificant product accrual remained for the chipset design issue. Note 19: Borrowings Short-Term Debt As of December 29, 2012, short-term debt consisted of drafts payable of $264 million and notes payable of $48 million (commercial paper of $200 million and drafts payable of $47 million as of December 31, 2011). We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2012 were $500 million ($1.4 billion during 2011). Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard  Poors and P-1 by Moodys as of December 29, 2012. Long-Term Debt Our long-term debt as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was as follows: ##TABLE_START   (In Millions)  2012   2011  2012 Senior notes due 2017 at 1.35%  $ 2,997   $   2012 Senior notes due 2022 at 2.70%   1,494      2012 Senior notes due 2032 at 4.00%   743      2012 Senior notes due 2042 at 4.25%   924      2011 Senior notes due 2016 at 1.95%   1,498    1,498  2011 Senior notes due 2021 at 3.30%   1,996    1,995  2011 Senior notes due 2041 at 4.80%   1,489    1,489  2009 Junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2039 at 3.25%   1,063    1,052  2005 Junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2035 at 2.95%   932    919  2007 Arizona bonds due 2037 at 5.30%       131       Total long-term debt  $ 13,136   $ 7,084       ##TABLE_END Senior Notes  In the fourth quarter of 2012, we issued $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes for general corporate purposes and to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock repurchase program. In the third quarter of 2011, we issued $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, primarily to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock repurchase program, and for general corporate purposes. Our senior notes pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually. We may redeem our senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time at our option at specified redemption prices. The senior notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and will effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Convertible Debentures In 2009, we issued $2.0 billion of junior subordinated convertible debentures (the 2009 debentures). In 2005, we issued $1.6 billion of junior subordinated convertible debentures (the 2005 debentures). Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually. ##TABLE_START      2009 Debentures   2005 Debentures  Annual coupon interest rate   3.25 %   2.95 % Annual effective interest rate   7.20 %   6.45 % Maximum amount of contingent interest that will accrue per year   0.50 %   0.40 % ##TABLE_END The effective interest rate is based on the rate for a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature. Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures have a contingent interest component that requires us to pay interest based on certain thresholds or for certain events, commencing on August 1, 2019 for the 2009 debentures. As of December 29, 2012, we have not met any of the thresholds or events related to the 2005 debentures. The fair values of the related embedded derivatives were $6 million and zero as of December 29, 2012 for the 2009 and 2005 debentures, respectively ($10 million and zero as of December 31, 2011 for the 2009 and 2005 debentures, respectively). Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into shares of our common stock. Holders can surrender the 2009 debentures for conversion if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter. Holders can surrender the 2005 debentures for conversion at any time. We will settle any conversion or repurchase of the 2009 debentures in cash up to the face value, and any amount in excess of face value will be settled in cash or stock at our option. However, we can settle any conversion or repurchase of the 2005 debentures in cash or stock at our option. On or after August 5, 2019, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2009 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the date on which we provide notice of redemption. We can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2005 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the date on which we provide notice of redemption. If certain events occur in the future, the indentures governing the 2009 and 2005 debentures provide that each holder of the debentures can, for a pre-defined period of time, require us to repurchase the holders debentures for the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures are subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior debt and to the other liabilities of our subsidiaries. We have concluded that both the 2009 and 2005 debentures are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded stock conversion options qualify as derivatives. In addition, we have concluded that the embedded conversion options would be classified in stockholders equity if they were freestanding derivative instruments. As such, the embedded conversion options are not accounted for separately as derivatives. ##TABLE_START        2009 Debentures   2005 Debentures  (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  Dec. 29, 2012   Dec. 31, 2011   Dec. 29, 2012   Dec. 31, 2011  Outstanding principal  $ 2,000   $ 2,000   $ 1,600   $ 1,600  Equity component carrying amount  $ 613   $ 613   $ 466   $ 466  Unamortized discount  $ 922   $ 933   $ 656   $ 669  Net debt carrying amount  $ 1,063   $ 1,052   $ 932   $ 919  Conversion rate (shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures)   45.05    44.55    33.86    32.94  Effective conversion price (per share of common stock)  $ 22.20   $ 22.45   $ 29.53   $ 30.36  ##TABLE_END  In the preceding table, the remaining amortization periods for the unamortized discounts for the 2009 and 2005 debentures are approximately 27 and 23 years, respectively, as of December 29, 2012. The conversion rate adjusts for certain events outlined in the indentures governing the 2009 and 2005 debentures, such as quarterly dividend distributions in excess of $0.14 and $0.10 per share for the 2009 and 2005 debentures, respectively, but it does not adjust for accrued interest. In addition, the conversion rate will increase for a holder of either the 2009 or 2005 debentures who elects to convert the debentures in connection with certain share exchanges, mergers, or consolidations involving Intel.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Arizona Bonds In 2007, we guaranteed repayment of principal and interest on bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona, which constituted an unsecured general obligation for Intel. The aggregate principal amount of the bonds issued in December 2007 was $125 million. The 2007 Arizona bonds were tendered and repaid in December 2012. These bonds bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.3%. In the future, we may re-market the bonds as either fixed-rate bonds for a specified period or as variable-rate bonds until their final maturity on December 1, 2037. Debt Maturities As of December 29, 2012, our aggregate debt maturities based on outstanding principal were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year Payable     2013  $   2014     2015     2016   1,500  2017   3,000  2018 and thereafter   10,275     Total  $ 14,775     ##TABLE_END Substantially all of the difference between the total aggregate debt maturities in the preceding table and the total carrying amount of our debt is due to the unamortized discount of our convertible debentures. Note 20: Retirement Benefit Plans Retirement Contribution Plans We provide tax-qualified retirement contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. and certain other countries. The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees hired prior to January 1, 2011 are eligible for and receive discretionary employer contributions in the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan, while employees hired on or after January 1, 2011 receive discretionary employer contributions in the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan. Our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) determines the annual discretionary employer contribution amounts for the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan and the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan under delegation of authority from our Board of Directors, pursuant to the terms of the plans. As of December 29, 2012, 80% of our U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan assets were invested in equities, and 20% were invested in fixed-income instruments. These assets are managed by external investment managers. The discretionary employer contributions made to the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan are participant-directed. For the benefit of eligible U.S. employees, we also provide a non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees. This plan is designed to permit certain discretionary employer contributions and to permit employee deferral of a portion of compensation in addition to their Intel 401(k) Savings Plan deferrals. This plan is unfunded. We expensed $357 million for the qualified and non-qualified U.S. retirement contribution plans in 2012 ($340 million in 2011 and $319 million in 2010). In the first quarter of 2013, we funded $336 million for the 2012 contributions to the qualified U.S. retirement contribution plans. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans U.S. Pension Benefits. For employees hired prior to January 1, 2011, we provide a tax-qualified defined-benefit pension plan, the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan, for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. The U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan benefit is determined by a participants years of service and final average compensation (taking into account the participants Social Security wage base). The plan generates a minimum pension benefit if the participants U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan benefit exceeds the annuitized value of their U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan benefit. If participant balances in the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan do not grow sufficiently, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan could increase significantly. Non-U.S. Pension Benefits. We also provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain other countries, most significantly Ireland, Israel, Germany and Japan. Consistent with the requirements of local law, we deposit funds for certain plans with insurance companies, with third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts, and/or accrue for the unfunded portion of the obligation. As of June 20, 2012 (the effective date), Ireland closed its pension plan to employees hired on or after the effective date.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits. Upon retirement, eligible U.S. employees are credited with a defined dollar amount, based on years of service, into a U.S. Sheltered Employee Retirement Medical Account (SERMA). These credits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase coverage in the retirees choice of medical plan. If the available credits are not sufficient to pay the entire cost of the coverage, the remaining cost is the retirees responsibility. Funding Policy. Our practice is to fund the various pension plans and the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of U.S. federal laws and regulations or applicable local laws and regulations. Additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate. Depending on the design of the plan, local customs, and market circumstances, the liabilities of a plan may exceed qualified plan assets.

Included in the aggregate data in the following tables are the amounts applicable to our pension plans, with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, as well as plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. Amounts related to such plans were as follows: ##TABLE_START        U.S. Pension Benefits   Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  (In Millions)  2012   2011   2012   2011  Plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:     Accumulated benefit obligations  $    $    $ 813   $ 563  Plan assets  $    $    $ 508   $ 363  Plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:     Projected benefit obligations  $ 1,742   $ 1,480   $ 1,400   $ 1,064  Plan assets  $ 684   $ 648   $ 825   $ 658  ##TABLE_END Assumptions Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 were as follows: ##TABLE_START          U.S. Pension Benefits   Non-U.S. Pension Benefits   U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits     2012   2011   2012   2011   2012   2011  Discount rate   3.9 %   4.7 %   4.2 %   4.9 %   3.6 %   4.6 % Rate of compensation increase   4.1 %   4.5 %   4.0 %   4.2 %   n/a    n/a  ##TABLE_END Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine costs for the plans were as follows: ##TABLE_START             U.S. Pension Benefits   Non-U.S. Pension Benefits   U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits     2012   2011   2010   2012   2011   2010   2012   2011   2010  Discount rate   4.7 %   5.8 %   6.1 %   5.0 %   5.3 %   5.6 %   4.6 %   5.6 %   6.3 % Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets   5.0 %   5.5 %   4.5 %   5.9 %   6.3 %   6.2 %   3.0 %   3.0 %   n/a  Rate of compensation increase   4.5 %   4.7 %   5.1 %   4.1 %   4.3 %   3.6 %   n/a    n/a    n/a  ##TABLE_END  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  For the U.S. plans, we developed the discount rate by calculating the benefit payment streams by year to determine when benefit payments will be due. We then matched the benefit payment streams by year to the AA corporate bond rates to match the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments and discounted back to the measurement date to determine the appropriate discount rate. For the non-U.S. plans, we used two approaches to develop the discount rate. In certain countries, we used a model consisting of a theoretical bond portfolio for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximated the estimated benefit payments of our pension plans. In other countries, we analyzed current market long-term bond rates and matched the bond maturity with the average duration of the pension liabilities. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions takes into consideration both duration and risk of the investment portfolios, and is developed through consensus and building-block methodologies. The consensus methodology includes unadjusted estimates by the fund manager on future market expectations by broad asset classes and geography. The building-block approach determines the rates of return implied by historical risk premiums across asset classes. In addition, we analyzed rates of return relevant to the country where each plan is in effect and the investments applicable to the plan, expectations of future returns, local actuarial projections, and the projected long-term rates of return from external investment managers. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets shown for the non-U.S. plan assets is weighted to reflect each countrys relative portion of the non-U.S. plan assets. Net Periodic Benefit Cost The net periodic benefit cost for the plans included the following components: ##TABLE_START             U.S. Pension Benefits   Non-U.S. Pension Benefits   U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits  (In Millions)  2012   2011   2010   2012   2011   2010   2012   2011   2010  Service cost  $ 98   $ 51   $ 38   $ 64   $ 63   $ 40   $ 30   $ 18   $ 16  Interest cost   69    42    34    52    52    35    17    16    14  Expected return on plan assets   (31 )   (31 )   (18 )   (42 )   (47 )   (34 )   (4 )   (2 )     Amortization of prior service cost               (2 )   (1 )   1    7    8    6  Recognized net actuarial loss (gain)   74    26    18    16    11    5        (1 )   (1 ) Recognized curtailment gains                   (4 )                 Recognized settlement losses                   6                                     Net periodic benefit cost  $ 210   $ 88   $ 72   $ 88   $ 80   $ 47   $ 50   $ 39   $ 35                     ##TABLE_END  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  U.S. Pension Plan Assets In general, the investment strategy for U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets is to maximize risk-adjusted returns, taking into consideration the investment horizon and expected volatility, to ensure that there are sufficient assets available to pay pension benefits as they come due. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 80% to 90% for fixed-income debt instrument investments and 10% to 20% for hedge fund investments. The expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets is 4.5%. U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following investment categories as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011: ##TABLE_START        December 29, 2012     Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using   Total  (In Millions)  Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Equity securities:     Hedge fund pool  $    $ 92   $    $ 92  Fixed income:     Global Bond Fundcommon collective trusts       17        17  Global Bond Fundgovernment bonds   177    81        258  Global Bond Fundasset-backed securities           83    83  Global Bond Fundcorporate bonds   72    142        214  Global Bond Fundother   1    9        10           Total assets measured at fair value  $ 250   $ 341   $ 83   $ 674           Cash      10        Total U.S. pension plan assets at fair value     $ 684                December 31, 2011   Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using     (In Millions)  Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Total  Equity securities:     Hedge fund pool  $    $ 97   $    $ 97  Fixed income:     Global Bond Fundcommon collective trusts       51        51  Global Bond Fundgovernment bonds   94    166        260  Global Bond Fundasset-backed securities           78    78  Global Bond Fundcorporate bonds       147        147  Global Bond Fundother       6        6           Total assets measured at fair value  $ 94   $ 467   $ 78   $ 639           Cash      9        Total U.S. pension plan assets at fair value     $ 648        ##TABLE_END  The Global Bond Fund investment strategy seeks to invest in fixed-income securities that provide protection from both deflation and inflation while providing current income. Government bonds include bonds issued or deemed to be guaranteed by government entities and include instruments such as non-U.S. government bonds, U.S. Treasury securities, and U.S. agency securities. Corporate bonds include both U.S. and non-U.S. bonds with the majority held in high-quality bonds. We classified asset-backed securities in the Global Bond Fund as Level 3, as we have used unobservable inputs to the valuations that were significant to the fair value measurements. During 2012, approximately $90 million of government bonds and corporate bonds was transferred from Level 2 to Level 1, primarily based on the increased market activity for the underlying securities. Our policy is to reflect transfers in and transfers out at the beginning of the period in which a change in circumstances resulted in the transfer.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Non-U.S. Plan Assets The investments of the non-U.S. plans are managed by insurance companies, third-party trustees, or pension funds, consistent with regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. The investment manager evaluates performance by comparing the actual rate of return to the return on other similar assets. Investments managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under standard contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we have discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equities and fixed-income debt instruments, either through index funds or direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market risk and to assure that the pension assets are available to pay benefits as they come due. The average expected long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plan assets is 5.2%. Non-U.S. plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following investment categories as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011: ##TABLE_START        December 29, 2012     Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using   Total  (In Millions)  Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Equity securities:     Global equities  $ 183   $ 53   $    $ 236  Real estate           10    10  Non-U.S. venture capital           2    2  Fixed income:     Non-U.S. government bonds       177        177  Money market funds   58            58  Investments held by insurance companies       302        302  Insurance contracts           31    31  Other       6        6           Total assets measured at fair value  $ 241   $ 538   $ 43   $ 822           Cash      16        Total non-U.S. plan assets at fair value     $ 838                December 31, 2011   Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using     (In Millions)  Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Total  Equity securities:     Global equities  $ 153   $ 48   $    $ 201  Real estate           10    10  Non-U.S. venture capital           3    3  Fixed income:     Non-U.S. government bonds       124        124  Money market funds   57            57  Investments held by insurance companies       280        280  Insurance contracts           29    29  Other   5            5           Total assets measured at fair value  $ 215   $ 452   $ 42   $ 709           Cash      13        Total non-U.S. plan assets at fair value     $ 722        ##TABLE_END Certain amounts in the 2011 non-U.S. plan assets at fair value table have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  The majority of the assets in the Global equities category in the preceding tables are invested in a diversified mix of equities of developed countries, including the U.S., and emerging markets throughout the world. The Investments held by insurance companies and Insurance contracts categories in the preceding tables are managed by qualified insurance companies. We do not have control over the target allocation or visibility of the investment strategies of those investments. Insurance contracts and investments held by insurance companies made up 40% of total non-U.S. plan assets as of December 29, 2012 (43% as of December 31, 2011). The target allocation of the non-U.S. plan assets that we have control over is 49% equity securities and 51% fixed-income instruments. U.S. Postretirement Medical Plan Assets In general, the investment strategy for U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets due to the level of expected future benefit payments. In 2012 we modified the investment strategy for plan assets from investing solely in a money market account to investing in a tax-aware global equity portfolio, which is actively managed by an external investment manager. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is comprised of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries, including the U.S., and emerging markets throughout the world. The expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets is 7.7%. As of December 29, 2012, all of the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets were invested in exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. Concentrations of Risk We manage a variety of risks, including market, credit, and liquidity risks, across our plan assets through our investment managers. We define a concentration of risk as an undiversified exposure to one of the aforementioned risks that unnecessarily increases the exposure to a loss of plan assets. We monitor exposure to such risks in both the U.S. and non-U.S. plans by monitoring the magnitude of the risk in each plan and diversifying our exposure to such risks across a variety of instruments, markets, and counterparties. As of December 29, 2012, we did not have concentrations of risk in any single entity, manager, counterparty, sector, industry, or country. Funding Expectations Under applicable law for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan and the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan, we are not required to make any contributions during 2013. Our expected required funding for the non-U.S. plans during 2013 is approximately $63 million. Estimated Future Benefit Payments Estimated benefit payments over the next 10 fiscal years are as follows: ##TABLE_START    (In Millions)  U.S. Pension Benefits   Non-U.S. Pension Benefits   U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits  2013  $ 41   $ 24   $ 18  2014  $ 48   $ 26   $ 19  2015  $ 61   $ 27   $ 23  2016  $ 76   $ 29   $ 22  2017  $ 90   $ 31   $ 22  20182022  $ 799   $ 201   $ 121  ##TABLE_END  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Note 21: Commitments A portion of our capital equipment and certain facilities are under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2028. Additionally, portions of our land are under leases that expire at various dates through 2062. Rental expense was $214 million in 2012 ($178 million in 2011 and $124 million in 2010). Minimum rental commitments under all non-cancelable leases with an initial term in excess of one year were as follows as of December 29, 2012: ##TABLE_START  (In Millions)     2013  $ 206  2014   177  2015   138  2016   98  2017   80  2018 and thereafter   210     Total  $ 909     ##TABLE_END Commitments for construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment totaled $4.6 billion as of December 29, 2012 ($4.7 billion as of December 31, 2011), substantially all of which will be due within the next year. Other purchase obligations and commitments totaled approximately $2.0 billion as of December 29, 2012 (approximately $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2011). Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include, for example, agreements to fund various projects with other companies. In addition, we have various contractual commitments with Micron and IMFT. For further information on these contractual commitments, see Note 10: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments. Note 22: Employee Equity Incentive Plans Our equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. In May 2011, stockholders approved an extension of the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan). Stockholders approved 168 million additional shares for issuance, increasing the total shares of common stock available for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors to 596 million shares. The approval also extended the expiration date of the 2006 Plan to June 2014. The maximum shares to be awarded as non-vested shares (restricted stock) or non-vested share units (restricted stock units) was increased to 394 million shares. As of December 29, 2012, 247 million shares remained available for future grant under the 2006 Plan. Going forward, we may assume the equity incentive plans and the outstanding equity awards of certain acquired companies. Once they are assumed, we do not grant additional shares under those plans. In connection with our completed acquisition of McAfee in 2011, we assumed McAfees equity incentive plan and issued replacement awards. The stock options and restricted stock units issued generally retain similar terms and conditions of the respective plan under which they were originally granted. We issue restricted stock units with both a market condition and a service condition (market-based restricted stock units), referred to in our 2012 Proxy Statement as outperformance stock units, to a small group of senior officers and non-employee directors. For market-based restricted stock units issued in 2012, the number of shares of Intel common stock to be received at vesting will range from 50% to 200% of the target amount, based on total stockholder return (TSR) on Intel common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of a peer group over a three-year period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. As of December 29, 2012, 4 million market-based restricted stock units were outstanding. These market-based restricted stock units accrue dividend equivalents and generally vest three years and one month from the grant date. Equity awards granted to employees in 2012 under our equity incentive plans generally vest over four years from the date of grant, and options expire seven years from the date of grant, with the exception of market-based restricted stock units, a small number of restricted stock units granted to executive-level employees, and replacement awards related to acquisitions. The 2006 Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific dates. In May 2011, stockholders approved an extension of the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan. Stockholders approved 133 million additional shares for issuance, increasing the total shares of common stock available for issuance to 373 million shares. The approval also extended the expiration date of the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan to August 2016. As of December 29, 2012, 237 million shares were available for issuance under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation recognized in 2012 was $1.1 billion ($1.1 billion in 2011 and $917 million in 2010). On a quarterly basis, we assess changes to our estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on our review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. We recognize the effect of adjustments made to the forfeiture rates, if any, in the period that we change the forfeiture estimate. The effect of forfeiture adjustments in 2012, 2011, and 2010 was not significant. The total share-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory as of December 29, 2012 was $41 million ($38 million as of December 31, 2011 and $48 million as of December 25, 2010). During 2012, the tax benefit that we realized for the tax deduction from share-based awards totaled $510 million ($327 million in 2011 and $266 million in 2010). We estimate the fair value of restricted stock unit awards with time-based vesting using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting. We estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock units using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant. We based the weighted average estimated value of restricted stock unit grants, as well as the weighted average assumptions that we used in calculating the fair value, on estimates at the date of grant, as follows: ##TABLE_START       2012   2011   2010  Estimated values  $ 25.32   $ 19.86   $ 22.56  Risk-free interest rate   0.3 %   0.7 %   1.1 % Dividend yield   3.3 %   3.4 %   2.6 % Volatility   26 %   27 %   31 % ##TABLE_END We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted under our equity incentive plans and rights to acquire stock granted under our stock purchase plan. We based the weighted average estimated value of employee stock option grants and rights granted under the stock purchase plan, as well as the weighted average assumptions used in calculating the fair value, on estimates at the date of grant, as follows: ##TABLE_START          Stock Options   Stock Purchase Plan     2012   2011   2010   2012   2011   2010  Estimated values  $ 4.22   $ 3.91   $ 4.82   $ 5.47   $ 4.69   $ 4.71  Expected life (in years)   5.3    5.4    4.9    0.5    0.5    0.5  Risk-free interest rate   1.0 %   2.2 %   2.5 %   0.1 %   0.2 %   0.2 % Volatility   25 %   27 %   28 %   24 %   26 %   32 % Dividend yield   3.3 %   3.4 %   2.7 %   3.3 %   3.6 %   3.1 % ##TABLE_END  We base the expected volatility on implied volatility because we have determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. Prior to 2011, we used the simplified method of calculating expected life due to significant differences in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to our historical grants. In 2011, we began using historical option exercise data as the basis for determining expected life, as we believe that we have sufficient historical data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected life input for valuing options using the Black-Scholes model.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Restricted Stock Unit Awards Information with respect to outstanding restricted stock unit (RSU) activity is as follows: ##TABLE_START   (In Millions, Except Per RSU Amounts)  Number of RSUs   Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value  December 26, 2009   105.4   $ 17.03  Granted   32.4   $ 22.56  Vested   (34.6 )  $ 17.70  Forfeited   (3.4 )  $ 17.98      December 25, 2010   99.8   $ 18.56  Granted   43.3   $ 19.86  Assumed in acquisition   5.8   $ 20.80  Vested   (37.5 )  $ 18.60  Forfeited   (4.4 )  $ 19.07      December 31, 2011   107.0   $ 19.18  Granted   49.9   $ 25.32  Vested   (43.2 )  $ 18.88  Forfeited   (4.4 )  $ 20.93      December 29, 2012   109.3   $ 22.03      Expected to vest as of December 29, 2012   103.5   $ 20.21      ##TABLE_END  The aggregate fair value of awards that vested in 2012 was $1.2 billion ($753 million in 2011 and $808 million in 2010), which represents the market value of Intel common stock on the date that the restricted stock units vested. The grant-date fair value of awards that vested in 2012 was $816 million ($697 million in 2011 and $612 million in 2010). The number of restricted stock units vested includes shares that we withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. Restricted stock units that are expected to vest are net of estimated future forfeitures. As of December 29, 2012, there was $1.5 billion in unrecognized compensation costs related to restricted stock units granted under our equity incentive plans. We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of 1.3 years. Stock Option Awards As of December 29, 2012, options outstanding that have vested and are expected to vest are as follows: ##TABLE_START        Number of Options (In Millions)   Weighted Average Exercise Price   Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (In Years)   Aggregate Intrinsic Value (In Millions)  Vested   139.8   $ 19.76    2.5   $ 199  Expected to vest   59.9   $ 21.12    4.7   $ 69         Total   199.7   $ 20.17    3.2   $ 268         ##TABLE_END  Aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price and $20.23, the closing price of Intel common stock on December 28, 2012, as reported on The NASDAQ Global Select Market*, for all in-the-money options outstanding. Options outstanding that are expected to vest are net of estimated future option forfeitures. Options with a fair value of $205 million completed vesting during 2012 ($226 million during 2011 and $240 million during 2010). As of December 29, 2012, there was $96 million in unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options granted under our equity incentive plans. We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of 1.0 years.

Option exercise prices for options exercised during the three-year period ended December 29, 2012 ranged from $0.33 to $28.15. Stock Purchase Plan Approximately 72% of our employees were participating in our stock purchase plan as of December 29, 2012 (70% in 2011 and 75% in 2010). Employees purchased 17.4 million shares in 2012 for $355 million under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan (18.5 million shares for $318 million in 2011 and 17.2 million shares for $281 million in 2010). As of December 29, 2012, there was $13 million in unrecognized compensation costs related to rights to acquire common stock under our stock purchase plan. We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately one and a half months.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Note 23: Common Stock Repurchases Common Stock Repurchase Program We have an ongoing authorization, since October 2005, as amended, from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $45 billion in shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. As of December 29, 2012, $5.3 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit. During 2012, we repurchased 191.0 million shares of common stock at a cost of $4.8 billion (642.3 million shares of common stock at a cost of $14.1 billion in 2011 and 70.3 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1.5 billion in 2010). We have repurchased 4.3 billion shares at a cost of $89 billion since the program began in 1990. Restricted Stock Unit Withholdings We issue restricted stock units as part of our equity incentive plans. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. During 2012, we withheld 12.6 million shares to satisfy $345 million of employees tax obligations (10.3 million shares to satisfy $207 million during 2011 and 10.1 million shares to satisfy $236 million during 2010). Although shares withheld are not issued, they are treated as common stock repurchases in our consolidated financial statements, as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. Note 24: Earnings Per Share We computed our basic and diluted earnings per common share as follows: ##TABLE_START    (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  2012   2011   2010  Net income available to common stockholders  $ 11,005   $ 12,942   $ 11,464  Weighted average common shares outstandingbasic   4,996    5,256    5,555  Dilutive effect of employee equity incentive plans   100    101    89  Dilutive effect of convertible debt   64    54    52         Weighted average common shares outstandingdiluted   5,160    5,411    5,696         Basic earnings per common share  $ 2.20   $ 2.46   $ 2.06         Diluted earnings per common share  $ 2.13   $ 2.39   $ 2.01         ##TABLE_END  We computed our basic earnings per common share using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We computed diluted earnings per common share using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Net income available to participating securities was insignificant for all periods presented. Potentially dilutive common shares from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan. Potentially dilutive common shares are determined by applying the if-converted method for the 2005 debentures. However, as our 2009 debentures require settlement of the principal amount of the debt in cash upon conversion, with the conversion premium paid in cash or stock at our option, potentially dilutive common shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method. For further discussion on the specific conversion features of our 2005 and 2009 debentures, see Note 19: Borrowings. For 2012, we excluded 29 million outstanding weighted average stock options (90 million in 2011 and 161 million in 2010) from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the exercise prices of these stock options were greater than or equal to the average market value of the common shares. These options could be included in the calculation in the future if the average market value of the common shares increases and is greater than the exercise price of these options. In 2012 and 2011, we included our 2009 debentures in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the average market price was above the conversion price. In 2010, we excluded the 2009 debentures from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the conversion option of the debentures was anti-dilutive. We could potentially exclude the 2009 debentures again in the future if the average market price is below the conversion price.

These full tax exemptions expire at various dates through 2020; however, the exemptions in certain countries are eligible for renewal. In 2012, the tax benefit attributable to tax holidays was $252 million with a $0.05 impact on diluted earnings per share. The tax holiday benefits for 2011 and 2010 were $554 million ($0.10 per diluted share) and $256 million ($0.04 per diluted share), respectively. During 2012, net income tax benefits attributable to equity-based compensation transactions that were allocated to stockholders equity totaled $137 million (net deficiencies of $18 million in 2011 and net benefits of $40 million in 2010).  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Deferred and Current Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at year-ends were as follows: ##TABLE_START   (In Millions)  2012   2011  Deferred tax assets   Accrued compensation and other benefits  $ 1,125   $ 1,016  Share-based compensation   638    732  Deferred income   637    616  Inventory   506    613  Unrealized losses on investments and derivatives   36    293  State credits and net operating losses   297    230  Other, net   654    756       Gross deferred tax assets   3,893    4,256  Valuation allowance   (389 )   (373 )      Total deferred tax assets  $ 3,504   $ 3,883       Deferred tax liabilities   Property, plant and equipment  $ (2,325 )  $ (2,329 ) Licenses and intangibles   (778 )   (915 ) Convertible debt   (856 )   (799 ) Investment in foreign subsidiaries   (213 )   (214 ) Other, net   (269 )   (208 )      Total deferred tax liabilities  $ (4,441 )  $ (4,465 )      Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)  $ (937 )  $ (582 )      Reported as:   Current deferred tax assets  $ 2,117   $ 1,700  Non-current deferred tax assets   358    335  Non-current deferred tax liabilities   (3,412 )   (2,617 )      Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)  $ (937 )  $ (582 )      ##TABLE_END  Non-current deferred tax assets are included within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The valuation allowance is based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. The valuation allowance as of December 29, 2012 included allowances related to unrealized state credit carryforwards of $284 million and matters related to our non-U.S. subsidiaries of $105 million. As of December 29, 2012, our federal, state, and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $271 million, $365 million, and $635 million, respectively. The majority of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The remaining non-U.S. as well as the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2032. A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. relates to acquisitions and, as a result, is limited in the amount that can be recognized in any one year. The non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards include $412 million that is not likely to be recovered and has been reduced by a valuation allowance. As of December 29, 2012, we had not recognized U.S. deferred income taxes on a cumulative total of $17.5 billion of undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and $2.6 billion of other basis differences of our investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries primarily related to McAfee. Determining the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to investments in these non-U.S. subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested is not practicable. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest those earnings and other basis differences in operations outside the U.S. Current income taxes receivable of $866 million as of December 29, 2012 ($191 million as of December 31, 2011) is included in other current assets. Current income taxes payable of $711 million as of December 29, 2012 ($335 million as of December 31, 2011) is included in other accrued liabilities. Long-term income taxes payable of $177 million as of December 29, 2012 ($165 million as of December 31, 2011), within other long-term liabilities, includes uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and non-U.S. tax credits, and may also include other long-term tax liabilities that are not uncertain but have not yet been paid.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Uncertain Tax Positions The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows: ##TABLE_START    (In Millions)  2012   2011   2010  Beginning gross unrecognized tax benefits  $ 212   $ 216   $ 220  Settlements and effective settlements with tax authorities and related remeasurements   (81 )   (63 )   (73 ) Lapse of statute of limitations   (5 )   (17 )     Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods   56    91    28  Decreases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods   (6 )   (21 )   (30 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during current period   13    6    71         Ending gross unrecognized tax benefits  $ 189   $ 212   $ 216         ##TABLE_END  During 2012, we settled and effectively settled matters with the Internal Revenue Service, certain non-U.S., and state tax authorities relating to tax positions taken during prior periods. The result of the settlements, effective settlements, and resulting remeasurements was a reduction of $81 million in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits ($63 million in 2011 and $73 million in 2010), $7 million of which resulted in a tax benefit for 2012 ($61 million for 2011 and $48 million for 2010). If the remaining balance of $189 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 29, 2012 ($212 million as of December 31, 2011) were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $66 million and a reduction in the effective tax rate ($92 million as of December 31, 2011). Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in 2012 ($24 million in 2011 and insignificant in 2010). As of December 29, 2012, we had $66 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits ($90 million as of December 31, 2011). Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure on audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. However, given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. We file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and non-U.S. tax returns. For U.S. state and non-U.S. tax returns, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2001. For U.S. federal tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2008.  Note 27: Contingencies Legal Proceedings We are a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted in this section. Although management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. Were unfavorable outcomes to occur, the possibility exists for a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. However, we have not reached this conclusion with respect to any particular matter at this time. A number of proceedings generally have challenged and continue to challenge certain of our competitive practices. The allegations in these proceedings vary and are described in more detail in the following paragraphs. In general, they contend that we improperly condition price rebates and other discounts on our microprocessors on exclusive or near-exclusive dealing by some of our customers; and they allege that our software compiler business unfairly prefers Intel microprocessors over competing microprocessors and that, through the use of our compilers and other means, we have caused the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  benchmark results concerning our microprocessors. Based on the procedural posture of the various remaining competition matters, which we describe in subsequent paragraphs, our investment of resources to explain and defend our position has declined as compared to the period 2005-2011. Nonetheless, certain of the matters remain active, and these challenges could continue for a number of years, potentially requiring us to invest additional resources. We believe that we compete lawfully and that our marketing, business, intellectual property, and other challenged practices benefit our customers and our stockholders, and we will continue to conduct a vigorous defense in the remaining proceedings. Government Competition Matters and Related Consumer Class Actions In 2001, the European Commission (EC) commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy our microprocessors. We have received numerous requests for information and documents from the EC, and we have responded to each of those requests. The EC issued a Statement of Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. In May 2009, the EC issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged conditional rebates and payments that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged payments to prevent sales of specific rival products. The EC imposed a fine in the amount of  1.06 billion ($1.447 billion as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in the EC decision. In the second quarter of 2009, we recorded the related charge within marketing, general and administrative. We strongly disagree with the ECs decision, and we appealed the decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The hearing of our appeal took place on July 3 through July 6, 2012. The courts decision is expected in mid- to late 2013. The EC decision exceeds 500 pages but contains no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision states that we should cease and desist from further conduct that, in the ECs opinion, would violate applicable law. We have taken steps, which are subject to the ECs ongoing review, to comply with that decision pending appeal. We opened discussions with the EC to better understand the decision and to explain changes to our business practices. Based on our current understanding and expectations, we do not believe that any such changes will be material to our financial position, results, or cash flows. In June 2005, we received an inquiry from the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) requesting documents from our Korean subsidiary related to marketing and rebate programs that we entered into with Korean PC manufacturers. In February 2006, the KFTC initiated an inspection of documents at our offices in Korea. In September 2007, the KFTC served on us an Examination Report alleging that sales to two customers during parts of 20022005 violated Koreas Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act. In December 2007, we submitted our written response to the KFTC. In February 2008, the KFTCs examiner submitted a written reply to our response. In March 2008, we submitted a further response. In April 2008, we participated in a pre-hearing conference before the KFTC, and we participated in formal hearings in May and June 2008. In June 2008, the KFTC announced its intent to fine us approximately $25 million for providing discounts to Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and TriGem Computer Inc. In November 2008, the KFTC issued a final written decision concluding that our discounts had violated Korean antitrust law and imposing a fine on us of approximately $20 million, which we paid in January 2009. In December 2008, we appealed this decision by filing a lawsuit in the Seoul High Court seeking to overturn the KFTCs decision. We expect a decision from the court in 2013. At least 82 separate class-action suits have been filed in the U.S. District Courts for the Northern District of California, Southern District of California, District of Idaho, District of Nebraska, District of New Mexico, District of Maine, and District of Delaware, as well as in various California, Kansas, and Tennessee state courts. These actions generally repeat the allegations made in a now-settled lawsuit filed against Intel by AMD in June 2005 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (AMD litigation). Like the AMD litigation, these class-action suits allege that we engaged in various actions in violation of the Sherman Act and other laws by, among other things: providing discounts and rebates to our manufacturer and distributor customers conditioned on exclusive or near-exclusive dealing that allegedly unfairly interfered with AMDs ability to sell its microprocessors; interfering with certain AMD product launches; and interfering with AMDs participation in certain industry standards-setting groups. The class actions allege various consumer injuries, including that consumers in various states have been injured by paying higher prices for computers containing our microprocessors. We dispute these class-action claims and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. All of the federal class actions and the Kansas and Tennessee state court class actions have been transferred by the Multidistrict Litigation Panel to the U.S. District Court in Delaware for all pre-trial proceedings and discovery (MDL  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  proceedings). The Delaware district court has appointed a Special Master to address issues in the MDL proceedings, as assigned by the court. In January 2010, the plaintiffs in the Delaware action filed a motion for sanctions for our alleged failure to preserve evidence. This motion largely copies a motion previously filed by AMD in the AMD litigation, which has settled. The plaintiffs in the MDL proceedings also moved for certification of a class of members who purchased certain PCs containing products sold by us. In July 2010, the Special Master issued a Report and Recommendation (Class Report) denying the motion to certify a class. The MDL plaintiffs filed objections to the Special Masters Class Report, and a hearing on those objections was held in March 2011. In September 2012, the court ruled that an evidentiary hearing will be necessary to enable the court to rule on the objections to the Special Masters Class Report, to resolve the motion to certify the class, and to resolve a separate motion to exclude certain testimony and evidence from the MDL plaintiffs expert. The hearing is scheduled to occur in July 2013. All California class actions have been consolidated in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County. The plaintiffs in the California actions have moved for class certification, which we are in the process of opposing. At our request, the court in the California actions has agreed to delay ruling on this motion until after the Delaware district court rules on the similar motion in the MDL proceedings. Based on the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including, but not limited to, the fact that the Delaware district court has requested an evidentiary hearing and has not yet ruled on class certification issues, we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from these matters. Lehman Matter In November 2009, representatives of the Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. (LOTC) bankruptcy estate advised us informally that the estate was considering a claim against us arising from a 2008 contract between Intel and LOTC. Under the terms of the 2008 contract, we prepaid $1.0 billion to LOTC, in exchange for which LOTC was required to purchase and deliver to us the number of shares of Intel common stock that could be purchased for $1.0 billion at the discounted volume-weighted average price specified in the contract for the period September 2, 2008 to September 26, 2008. LOTCs performance under the contract was secured by $1.0 billion of cash collateral. Under the terms of the contract, LOTC was obligated to deliver approximately 50 million shares of our common stock to us on September 29, 2008. LOTC failed to deliver any shares of our common stock, and we exercised our right to set-off against the $1.0 billion collateral. LOTC has not initiated any action against us to date, but in February 2010, LOTC served a subpoena on us in connection with this transaction. In October 2010, LOTC demanded that we pay it at least $417 million. In September 2010, we entered into an agreement with LOTC that tolled any applicable statutes of limitations for 90 days and precluded the parties from commencing any formal proceedings to prosecute any claims against each other in any forum during that period. The tolling agreement with LOTC was extended several times, but lapsed in June 2011. We continue to believe that we acted appropriately under our agreement with LOTC, and we intend to defend any claim to the contrary. No complaint has been filed, and we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from any such complaint. McAfee Shareholder Litigation On August 19, 2010, we announced that we had agreed to acquire all of McAfees common stock for $48.00 per share. Four McAfee shareholders filed putative class-action lawsuits in Santa Clara County, California Superior Court challenging the proposed transaction. The cases were ordered consolidated in September 2010. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that named former McAfee board members, McAfee and Intel as defendants, and alleged that the McAfee board members breached their fiduciary duties and that McAfee and Intel aided and abetted those breaches of duty. The complaint requested rescission of the merger agreement, such other equitable relief as the court may deem proper, and an award of damages in an unspecified amount. In June 2012, the plaintiffs damages expert asserted that the value of a McAfee share for the purposes of assessing damages should be $62.08. In January 2012, the court certified the action as a class action, appointed the Central Pension Laborers Fund to act as the class representative, and scheduled trial to begin in January 2013. In March 2012, defendants filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse the class certification order; the petition was denied in June 2012. In March 2012, at defendants request, the court held that plaintiffs were not entitled to a jury trial, and ordered a bench trial. In April 2012, plaintiffs filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse that order, which the court of appeal denied in July 2012. In August 2012, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which was scheduled for hearing on November 2, 2012. On November 1, 2012, the court issued a tentative ruling granting defendants motion. Plaintiffs chose not to contest the tentative ruling, and the court adopted it as its final ruling on November 6, 2012. The trial court entered final judgment in the case on February 13, 2013, and plaintiffs have 60 days from the date of the judgment to file any appeal. Because the resolution of any appeal of this matter may materially impact the scope and nature of the proceeding, we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from this matter. We dispute the class-action claims and intend to continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  X2Y Attenuators, LLC v. Intel et al In May 2011, X2Y Attenuators, LLC (X2Y) filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania and a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) pursuant to Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 against us and two of our customers, Apple Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Company, alleging infringement of five patents. X2Y subsequently added a sixth patent to both actions. The district court action is stayed pending resolution of the ITC proceeding. X2Y alleges that at least Intel Core and Intel Xeon processor families infringe the asserted patents. X2Y also requests that the ITC issue permanent exclusion and cease-and-desist orders to, among other things, prohibit us from importing these microprocessors and Apple and Hewlett-Packard Company products that incorporate these microprocessors into the United States. In the district court action, X2Y seeks unspecified damages, including enhanced damages for alleged willful infringement, and injunctive relief. On June 13, 2012, the Administrative Law Judge issued an initial determination granting X2Ys motion to partially terminate the ITC investigation with respect to three of the asserted patents. The Administrative Law Judge held a hearing on the remaining three patents in August 2012 and issued an initial determination in December 2012. In the initial determination, the Administrative Law Judge found that Intel, Apple, and Hewlett-Packard have not violated Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 because they have not infringed any of the asserted claims of the three patents, and ruled that the asserted claims of two of the patents were invalid. In December 2012, the parties filed petitions for review of the initial determination by the ITC. On February 15, 2013, the ITC determined to review in part the initial determination. On review, the Commission determined to reverse or vacate certain findings, and to terminate the investigation with a finding of no violation. Based on the procedural posture and nature of the cases, including, but not limited to, the fact that monetary damages are not an available remedy in the ITC, and because discovery regarding X2Ys claimed damages has not commenced in the stayed district court action, we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from these matters. We dispute the claims and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. Note 28: Operating Segment and Geographic Information Our operating segments in effect as of December 29, 2012 include: ##TABLE_START   PC Client Group ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Data Center Group ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Other Intel architecture operating segments ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Intelligent Systems Group ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Intel Mobile Communications ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Netbook Group ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Tablet Group ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Phone Group ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Service Provider Group ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Software and services operating segments ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    McAfee ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Wind River Software Group ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Software and Services Group ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   All Other ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group ##TABLE_ENDIn 2012, we reorganized our smartphone, tablet, and mobile communication businesses within other Intel architecture operating segments to enable us to move faster and with greater collaboration and synergies in the market segment for mobile devices. As part of this reorganization, the former Netbook and Tablet Group was separated into the following new operating segments: Netbook Group, Tablet Group, and Service Provider Group. Additionally, the former Ultra-Mobility Group is now the Phone Group. The other Intel architecture operating segments continue to include the Intelligent Systems Group and Intel Mobile Communications. The other Intel architecture operating segments aggregation has not changed. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our President and CEO. The CODM allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about its revenue and operating income (loss). Our PC Client Group and our Data Center Group are reportable operating segments. We also aggregate and disclose the financial results of our non-reportable operating segments within other Intel architecture operating segments and software and services operating segments as shown in the preceding operating segments list. Each of the operating segments within the aggregated operating segments does not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the aggregation of these non-reportable operating segments. Revenue for our reportable and aggregated non-reportable operating segments is primarily related to the following product lines: ##TABLE_START   PC Client Group . Includes platforms designed for the notebook (including Ultrabook  , detachable, and convertible systems) and desktop (including high-end enthusiast PCs) market segments; and wireless connectivity products. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Data Center Group. Includes platforms designed for the server, workstation, and storage computing market segments; and wired network connectivity products. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Other Intel architecture operating segments. Includes platforms designed for embedded applications; mobile phone components such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers, and power management chips; platforms designed for the netbook market segment; platforms designed for the tablet market segment; platforms designed for the smartphone market segment; and gateway and set-top box components. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Software and services operating segments. Includes software products for endpoint security, network and content security, risk and compliance, and consumer and mobile security from our McAfee business; software optimized products for the embedded and mobile market segments; and software products and services that promote Intel  architecture as the platform of choice for software development. ##TABLE_END INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments, and the expenses are included in the operating results reported in the table that follows. The All other category includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as: ##TABLE_START   results of operations from our Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group that includes NAND flash memory products for use in a variety of devices; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   a portion of profit-dependent compensation and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   divested businesses for which discrete operating results are not reviewed by our CODM; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   results of operations of seed businesses that support our initiatives; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. ##TABLE_ENDThe CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. As our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segments operating income (loss) results. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Except for these differences, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole. Net revenue and operating income (loss) for the three years ended December 29, 2012 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    (In Millions)  2012   2011   2010  Net revenue    PC Client Group  $ 34,274   $ 35,406   $ 30,327  Data Center Group   10,741    10,129    8,693  Other Intel architecture operating segments   4,378    5,005    3,055  Software and services operating segments   2,381    1,870    264  All other   1,567    1,589    1,284         Total net revenue  $ 53,341   $ 53,999   $ 43,623         Operating income (loss)    PC Client Group  $ 13,053   $ 14,793   $ 12,971  Data Center Group   5,073    5,100    4,388  Other Intel architecture operating segments   (1,377 )   (577 )   270  Software and services operating segments   (11 )   (32 )   (175 ) All other   (2,100 )   (1,807 )   (1,866 )        Total operating income  $ 14,638   $ 17,477   $ 15,588         ##TABLE_END  In 2012, Hewlett-Packard Company accounted for 18% of our net revenue (19% in 2011 and 21% in 2010), Dell Inc. accounted for 14% of our net revenue (15% in 2011 and 17% in 2010), and Lenovo Group Limited accounted for 11% of our net revenue (9% in 2011 and 8% in 2010).

San Jose, California February 19, 2013  REPORT OF ERNST  YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intel Corporation We have audited Intel Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Intel Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Intel Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2012, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2012 consolidated financial statements of Intel Corporation and our report dated February 19, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on managements evaluation (with the participation of our CEO and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 29, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2012, the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Managements assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. Based on our assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst  Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting, as stated in the firms attestation report, which is included at the end of Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END Company Overview We design and manufacture advanced integrated digital technology platforms. A platform consists of a microprocessor and chipset, and may be enhanced by additional hardware, software, and services. We sell these platforms primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs), and industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries. Our platforms are used in a wide range of computing applications, such as notebooks (including Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems), desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, automobile infotainment systems, automated factory systems, and medical devices. We also develop and sell software and services primarily focused on security and technology integration. We were incorporated in California in 1968 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1989. Company Strategy Our goal is to be the preeminent computing solutions company that powers the worldwide digital economy. Over time, the number of devices connected to the Internet and each other has grown from hundreds of millions to billions, and the variety of devices also continues to increase. The combination of embedding computing into devices and connecting them to the Internet, known as the Internet of Things, as well as a build-out of the cloud infrastructure supporting these devices is driving fundamental changes in the computing industry. As a result, we are transforming our primary focus from the design and manufacture of semiconductor chips for personal computing (PC) and servers to the delivery of solutions consisting of hardware and software platforms and supporting services across a wide range of computing devices. Examples of these solutions can be seen across the computing continuum, from the teraflops of operations per second for high performance computing (HPC) to the milliwatts of energy consumed by an embedded application. Additionally, computing is becoming an increasingly mobile, personal, and ubiquitous experience. End users value consistency across devices that connect seamlessly and securely to the Internet and to each other. We enable this experience by innovating around energy-efficient performance, connectivity, and security. To succeed in this changing computing environment, we have the following key objectives: ##TABLE_START  strive to ensure that Intel  technology is the best choice for any computing device, including PCs, data centers, cloud computing, ultra-mobile devices, and wearables; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  be the platform of choice for any operating system; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  maximize and extend our manufacturing technology leadership; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extend to adjacent services such as security, cloud, and foundry; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expand platforms into adjacent market segments to bring compelling new System-on-Chip (SoC) solutions and user experiences to ultra-mobile form factors including smartphones and tablets, as well as notebooks (including Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems), embedded systems, and microserver applications; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  develop platforms to enable devices that connect to the Internet of Things and to each other to create a computing continuum offering consumers a set of secure, consistent, engaging, and personalized forms of computing; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  strive to lower the footprint of our products and operations as well as be an asset to the communities we work in. ##TABLE_END We use our core assets to meet these objectives. Our core assets include our silicon and manufacturing technology leadership, our architecture and platforms, our software and services, our security solutions, our customer orientation, our strategic investments, and our corporate stewardship. We believe that applying these core assets to our key objectives provides us with the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers needs quickly. Our core assets and key objectives include the following: ##TABLE_START  Silicon and Manufacturing Technology Leadership. We have long been a leader in silicon process technology and manufacturing, and we aim to continue our lead through investment and innovation in this critical area. We drive a regular two-year upgrade cycleintroducing a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramping the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. We refer to this as our tick-tock technology development cadence. With our continued focus on silicon and manufacturing technology leadership, we are collaborating on the development of 450-millimeter (mm) wafer technology and extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). We expect larger silicon wafers and enhanced lithography technologies with EUV to allow Moores Law to continue. Moores Law predicted that transistor density on integrated circuits would double about every two years. We aim to have the best process technology, and unlike many semiconductor companies, we primarily manufacture our products in our own facilities. This in-house manufacturing capability allows us to optimize performance, shorten our time to market, and scale new products more rapidly. We believe this competitive advantage will be extended in the future as the costs to build leading-edge fabrication facilities increase, and as fewer semiconductor companies will be able to combine platform design and manufacturing. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Architecture and Platforms. We are developing a wide range of solutions for devices that span the computing continuum and allow for computing experiences from notebooks (including Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems), desktops, tablets, and smartphones to in-vehicle infotainment systems and beyond. We believe that users want consistent computing experiences and interoperable devices and that users and developers value consistency of architecture. This provides a common framework that results in shortened time to market, and the ability to leverage technologies across multiple form factors. We believe that we can meet the needs of users and developers to offer computing solutions across the computing continuum through our partnership with the industry on open, standards-based platform innovation around Intel  architecture. We continue to invest in improving Intel architecture to deliver increased value to our customers and expand the capabilities of the architecture in adjacent market segments. For example, we focus on delivering improved energy-efficient performance, which involves balancing higher performance with lower power consumption. In addition, we are focusing on perceptual computing, which brings exciting user experiences through devices that sense and perceive the users actions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Software and Services. We offer software and services that provide solutions through a combination of hardware and software for consumer, ultra-mobile, and corporate environments.

We are making significant investments in this area with the accelerated development of our SoC solutions based on the 64-bit Intel  Atom  microarchitecture. We are also optimizing our server products for energy-efficient performance as we believe that increased Internet traffic and the use of ultra-mobile devices, the Internet of Things, and cloud computing has created the need for an improved server infrastructure. At the 2013 Intel Developer Forum, we introduced the Intel  Quark SoC family of products. Designed for applications where low power and size take priority over high performance, the Intel Quark SoC offers extremely low power consumption and a high level of integration in a low-cost package to be used in the next wave of intelligent connected devices. In addition, we also announced the Arduino*-compatible Intel  Galileo microcontroller board and the Intel  Edison development board at the Maker Faire* in Rome and the International Consumer Electronics Show, respectively. When combined with Intel Quark SoC, these systems provide an open-source platform for customers to design products such as, but not limited to, automation for home appliances or industrial manufacturing, home media centers, and robots. In combination with the continued build out of the cloud and the announcement of the Intel Quark technologies, we expect to be on the forefront of the acceleration and proliferation of the Internet of Things. Business Organization As of December 28, 2013 , we managed our business through the following operating segments: For a description of our operating segments, see  Note 27: Operating Segments and Geographic Information , in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Products Platforms We offer platforms that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or multichip package. Additionally, a platform may be enhanced by additional hardware, software, and services. A microprocessorthe central processing unit (CPU) of a computer systemprocesses system data and controls other devices in the system. We offer microprocessors with one or multiple processor cores. Multi-core microprocessors can enable improved multitasking and energy-efficient performance by distributing computing tasks across two or more cores. Our 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and expected-to-be-released 5th generation Intel  Core  (code-named \"Broadwell\") processor families integrate graphics functionality onto the processor die. In contrast, some of our previous-generation processors incorporated a separate graphics chip inside the processor package. Processor packages may also integrate a memory controller. A chipset sends data between the microprocessor and input, display, and storage devices, such as the keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard drive or solid-state drive, and optical disc drives. Chipsets extend the audio, video, and other capabilities of many systems and perform essential logic functions, such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks. We offer and continue to develop SoC products that integrate our core processing functions with other system components, such as graphics, audio, and video, onto a single chip. SoC products are designed to reduce total cost of ownership, provide improved performance due to higher integration and lower power consumption, and enable ultra-mobile form factors such as smartphones, tablets, Ultrabook devices, and 2 in 1 systems, as well as notebooks, desktops, embedded systems and microserver applications. With the release of our 4th generation Intel Core processor in 2013, we introduced a multichip package that integrates the chipset on one die with the CPU and graphics on another die, connected via a lower power on-package interface. Similar to a SoC, the multichip package can provide improved performance due to higher integration coupled with lower power consumption, which enables smaller form factors. We also offer features designed to improve our platform capabilities. For example, Intel  vPro  technology is a computer hardware-based security technology for the notebook and desktop market segments. Intel vPro is designed to provide businesses with increased manageability, upgradeability, energy-efficient performance, and security while lowering the total cost of ownership. We also offer Intel  Iris  technology, which provides graphics enhancements for 4th and expected-to-be-released 5th generation Intel Core processors. We offer a range of platforms based upon the following microprocessors: McAfee, Inc. McAfee, Inc. (McAfee) has the objective of improving the overall security of our platforms. McAfee offers software products that provide security solutions designed to protect systems in consumer, mobile, and corporate environments from malicious virus attacks as well as loss of data. McAfees products include software solutions for end-point security, network and content security, risk and compliance, and consumer and mobile security. Phone and Tablet Components We offer components for smartphones, tablets, and connected devices which include baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers, and power management integrated circuits. We also offer comprehensive smartphone and tablet platforms, including multimode Long Term Evolution (LTE*) modems, Bluetooth  wireless technology and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, software solutions, customization, and essential interoperability tests. Our mobile phone solutions, which are based on multiple industry standards, help enable mobile voice and high-speed data communications for a broad range of devices around the world.

Products and Product Strategy by Operating Segment Our PC Client Group operating segment offers products that are incorporated in notebook (including Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems) and desktop computers for consumers and businesses. In 2013, we introduced the 4th generation Intel Core processor family for use in notebooks, desktops, 2 in 1 systems, and tablets. These processors use 22-nanometer (nm) transistors and our Tri-Gate transistor processor technology. Our Tri-Gate transistor technology extends Moores Law and is the worlds first 3-D Tri-Gate transistor on a production technology. In combination, these enhancements can provide significant power savings and performance gains when compared to previous-generation technologies. Notebook Our strategy for the notebook computing market segment is to offer notebook technologies designed to bring exciting new user experiences to life and improve performance, battery life, wireless connectivity, manageability and security. In addition, we are designing for smaller, lighter, and thinner form factors. In the second half of 2014, we expect to introduce our 5th generation Intel Core processor family. We believe these processors will continue to deliver increasing levels of battery life and graphics performance, as well as provide OEMs and end users with more choice in operating system compatibility, energy efficiency, processor cores, and graphics performance. In addition to offering notebooks, we have worked with our customers to help them develop a new class of personal computing devices that includes Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems. These computers combine the energy-efficient performance and capabilities of todays notebooks and tablets with enhanced graphics and improved user interfaces such as touch and voice in a thin, light form factor that is highly responsive and secure, and that can seamlessly connect to the Internet. We believe the renewed innovation in the PC industry that we fostered with Ultrabook devices and expanded to 2 in 1 systems will continue. Desktop Our strategy for the desktop computing market segment is to offer exciting new user experiences and products that provide increased manageability, security, and energy-efficient performance. We are also focused on lowering the total cost of ownership for businesses. The desktop computing market segment includes all-in-one desktop products, which combine traditionally separate desktop components into one form factor. Additionally, all-in-one computers have transformed into portable and flexible form factors that offer users increased portability and new multi-user applications and uses. For desktop consumers, we also focus on the design of products for high-end enthusiast PCs and mainstream PCs with rapidly increasing audio and media capabilities. Our Data Center Group operating segment offers products designed to provide leading energy-efficient performance for all compute, network and storage platforms. In addition, the Data Center Group (DCG) focuses on specific optimizations for the Enterprise, Cloud, Communications Infrastructure and Technical Computing segments. DCG is continuing to ramp the many-core Intel  Xeon Phi  coprocessor with 60 or more high-performance, low-power Intel processor cores. The Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors are positioned to boost the power of the worlds most advanced supercomputers, allowing for trillions of calculations per second. We recently introduced new Intel  Xeon   processors incorporating Intels industry leading 22nm process technology. The 22nm Intel Xeon processors provide improved performance and better power consumption across the compute, network and storage portfolio. We also announced the second generation 64-bit Intel Atom microarchitecture-based SoC solutions to focus on storage, networking and highly dense, low-power server configurations. Our other Intel architecture operating segments offer products designed to be used in the Internet of Things, mobile communications, tablet, smartphone, service provider, netbook, and ultra-low power market segments. ##TABLE_START  Our strategy for the mobile communications market segment is to offer a portfolio of products that covers a broad range of wireless connectivity options by combining Intel WiFi technology with our 2G, 3G, and 4G LTE technologies. These products feature low power consumption, innovative designs, and multi-standard platform solutions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our strategy for the embedded market segment, addressed by our Intelligent Systems Group (ISG), is to lead the Internet of Things evolution by delivering new user experiences, business efficiencies, and productivity utilizing Intel architecture based solutions that provide long life-cycle support, software and architectural scalability, and platform integration. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our strategy for the tablet market segment is to offer Intel architecture solutions optimized for multiple operating systems and application ecosystems.

Other IA includes ISG, Multi-Comm, the Phone Group, the Service Provider Group, the Tablet Group, the Netbook Group, and the New Devices Group operating segments. SSG includes McAfee, the Wind River Software Group, and the Software and Services Group operating segments. All other consists primarily of revenue from the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group. Percentage of Revenue by Major Operating Segment (Dollars in Millions) Percentage of Revenue by Principal Product from Reportable Segments (Dollars in Millions) Competition The computing industry continuously evolves with new and enhanced technologies and products from existing and new providers. The markets for current and planned technologies can change quickly in response to the introduction of such technologies and products and other factors such as changes in consumer tastes. Intel faces significant competition in the development and market acceptance of technologies and products in this environment. Our platforms, based on Intel architecture, are positioned to compete across the spectrum of Internet-connected computing devices, from the lowest-power portable devices to the most powerful data center servers. We are a leading provider in the PC and server segments, where we face existing and emerging competition. In the PC segment, smaller mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones, offered by numerous vendors have become significant competitors to PCs for many usages. Most of these small devices currently use applications processors based on the ARM* architecture; feature low-power, long battery-life operation; and are built in SoC formats which integrate numerous functions on one chip. In the server segment, our data center products and platforms face emerging competition from many new entrants using ARM architecture or other technologies. We are a relatively new entrant to the segments for tablets, smartphones and similar mobile devices. We have adjusted our product roadmaps to emphasize the development of low-power SoC chips for these and other devices. The boundaries between the various segments are changing as the industry evolves and new segments emerge. We have a long-standing position as a supplier of components and software for embedded products and this marketplace is significantly expanding with increasing types and numbers of Internet-connected devices for industrial, commercial and consumer uses, which we refer to as the Internet of Things. We face numerous large and small incumbent competitors as well as new entrants in this growing market segment that use ARM architecture as well as other operating systems and software. Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, innovative design, features, price, quality, reliability, brand recognition and availability. The importance of these items will vary by the type of end system for the products. For example, performance might be among the most important factors for our products for servers, while price and integration might be among the most important factors for our products for tablets and smartphones. We are the owner of McAfee, a major provider of digital security products and services to businesses and consumers. There are numerous competitors offering security products and services, and we seek to offer competitive differentiation by integrating hardware and software security features in many of our offerings and to have security offerings in numerous market segments including mobile and embedded devices and for data centers. The ability of our products to operate on multiple operating systems in end-user products and platforms operated or sold by third parties, including OEMs, is a key competitive advantage. We seek to optimize our products for multiple operating systems and invest substantial resources working with third parties to do so, but such investments are risky given that it is not clear which products will succeed in the market. We have competitors in each of the market segments including other companies that make and sell microprocessors, SoCs, other silicon components, software and platforms to businesses which build and sell computing and communications devices to end-users. We also compete against others selling these goods and services to businesses that utilize the products for their internal processes (e.g., businesses running large data centers). We also face competition from OEMs that, to some degree, choose to vertically integrate their own proprietary semiconductor and software assets. By doing so, these OEMs may be attempting to offer greater differentiation in their products and to increase their share of the profits for each finished product they sell. Continuing changes in the industry such as acquisitions, business collaborations or licensing scenarios (such as injunctions or other litigation outcomes), could have a significant impact on our competitive position. One of our important competitive advantages is the combination of our network of manufacturing, assembly and test facilities with our global architecture design teams. We have made significant capital and research and development (RD) investments into t his integrated manufacturing network, which enables us to have more direct control over our processes, quality control, product cost, production timing, performance, power consumption, and manufacturing yield. The increased cost of constructing new fabrication facilities supporting smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers has led to a smaller pool of companies that can afford to build and equip leading-edge manufacturing facilities. Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries and subcontractors such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. and GlobalFoundries Inc. for manufacturing and assembly and test needs. We have recently start ed providing foundry services as an alternative to such foundries. Manufacturing and Assembly and Test As of December 28, 2013 , 46% of our wafer fabrication, including microprocessors and chipsets, was conducted within the U.S. at our facilities in New Mexico, Arizona, Oregon, and Massachusetts. The remaining 54% of our wafer fabrication was conducted outside the U.S. at our facilities in Israel and China. Our fabrication facility in Ireland is currently transitioning to a newer process technology node, with manufacturing expected to recommence in 2015. Wafer fabrication conducted within and outside the U.S. may be impacted by the timing of a facilitys transition to a newer process technology, as well as a facilitys capacity utilization. As of December 28, 2013 , we primarily manufactured our products in wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations: ##TABLE_START Products  Wafer Size  Process Technology  Locations Microprocessors  300mm  22nm  Israel, Arizona, Oregon Microprocessors and chipsets  300mm  32nm  New Mexico Microprocessors  300mm  45nm  New Mexico Chipsets  300mm  65nm  China Chipsets and other products  300mm  90nm  China Chipsets  200mm  130nm  Massachusetts ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 28, 2013 , most of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers using our 22nm and 32nm process technology. Our Massachusetts fabrication facility is our last manufacturing on 200mm wafers and is expected to cease production by the end of 2014. As we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology, we incur significant start-up costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing. However, continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs. The benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor, reducing heat output from each transistor, and increasing the number of integrated features on each chip. These advancements can result in microprocessors that are higher performing, consume less power, and cost less to manufacture. In addition, with each shift to a new process technology, we are able to produce more microprocessors per square foot of our wafer fabrication facilities. The costs to develop our process technology are significantly less than adding capacity by building additional wafer fabrication facilities using older process technology. We use third-party foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components, including networking and communications products. In addition, we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture board-level products and systems. We purchase certain communications networking products and mobile phone components from external vendors primarily in the Asia-Pacific region. Following the manufacturing process, the majority of our components are subject to assembly and test. We perform our components assembly and test at facilities in Malaysia, China, Costa Rica, and Vietnam . To augment capacity, we use subcontractors to perform assembly of certain products, primarily chipsets and networking and communications products. In addition, we use subcontractors to perform assembly and test of our mobile phone components. Our NAND flash memory products are manufactured by IMFT and Micron using 20nm, 25nm, or 34nm process technology, and assembly and test of these products is performed by Micron and other external subcontractors. For further information, see  Note 5: Cash and Investments  in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our employment practices are consistent with, and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by, local country law. In addition, we impose a minimum employee age requirement as well as progressive Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) requirements, regardless of local law. We have thousands of suppliers, including subcontractors, providing our various materials and service needs. We set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments. We communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources, but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country. In those cases, we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply. We have entered into long-term contracts with certain suppliers to ensure a portion of our silicon supply. Our products are typically manufactured at multiple Intel facilities around the world or by subcontractors. However, some products are manufactured in only one Intel or subcontractor facility, and we seek to implement action plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Research and Development We are committed to investing in world-class technology development, particularly in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits. RD expenditures were $10.6 billion in 2013 ( $10.1 billion in 2012 and $8.4 billion in 2011 ). Our RD activities are directed toward the delivery of solutions consisting of hardware and software platforms and supporting services across a wide range of computing devices. We are focused on developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products, which will in turn enable new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers. We focus our RD efforts on advanced computing technologies, developing new microarchitectures, advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology, delivering the next generation of platforms, improving our platform initiatives, developing new solutions in emerging technologies including wearable devices and embedded applications, and developing software solutions and tools. Our RD efforts are intended to enable new levels of performance and address areas such as energy efficiency, security, scalability for multi-core architectures, system manageability, and ease of use. As part of our RD efforts, we plan to introduce a new Intel Core microarchitecture for desktops, notebooks (including Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems), and Intel Xeon processors approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. We refer to this as our tick-tock technology development cadence as subsequently illustrated. Advances in our silicon technology have enabled us to continue making Moores Law a reality. We expect to begin manufacturing products using our 14nm process technology in Q1 2014. We are currently developing our 5th generation Intel Core processor family (code-named Broadwell) using our 14nm process technology, expected to be released in the second half of 2014. We are also developing 10nm manufacturing process technology, our next-generation process technology. We have continued expanding on the advances anticipated by Moores Law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products optimized for a wider variety of applications. We have accelerated the Intel Atom processor-based SoC roadmap for ultra-mobile form factors, including smartphones and tablets, as well as notebooks (including Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems), embedded systems, and microserver applications, from 32nm through 22nm to 14nm. We intend that Intel Atom processors for ultra-mobile form factors will eventually be on the same process technology as our leading-edge products. We expect that this acceleration will result in a significant reduction in transistor leakage, lower active power, and an increase in transistor density to enable more powerful, feature-rich smartphones and tablets with longer battery life. Intel  Quark SoC, our newest technology announced in Q3 2013, is an ultra-low power and low-cost architecture designed for the Internet of Things, from industrial machines to wearable devices. With our continued focus on silicon and manufacturing technology leadership, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) in 2012. These agreements, in which Intel purchased ASML securities and agreed to provide RD funding over five years, are intended to accelerate the development of 450mm wafer technology and EUV lithography. Our RD activities range from designing and developing new products and manufacturing processes to researching future technologies and products. We continue to make significant RD investments in the development of SoCs to enable growth in ultra-mobile form factors. In addition, we continue to make significant investments in wireless technologies including our work to develop a high-speed LTE solution for smartphones. Our second generation VoLTE product with LTE-advanced features, such as carrier aggregation, is expected to be available in the first half of 2014. We also continue to invest in graphics and HPC. Our RD model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies, leading standards initiatives, and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies, including joint pathfinding conducted between researchers at Intel Labs and our business groups. We centrally manage key cross-business group product initiatives to align and prioritize our RD activities across these groups. In addition, we may augment our RD activities by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar RD focus areas, as well as directly purchasing or licensing technology applicable to our RD initiatives. Employees As of December 28, 2013 , we had 107,600 employees worldwide ( 105,000 as of December 29, 2012 ), with approximately 51% of those employees located in the U.S. ( 51% as of December 29, 2012 ). Sales and Marketing Customers We sell our products primarily to OEMs and ODMs. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, we sell our products to other manufacturers, including makers of a wide range of industrial and communications equipment. Our customers also include those who buy PC components and our other products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customerssystems builders that purchase Intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors. We have a boxed processor program that allows distributors to sell our microprocessors in small quantities to customers of systems builders; boxed processors are also available in direct retail outlets. In 2013 , Hewlett-Packard Company accounted for 17% of our net revenue ( 18% in 2012 and 19% in 2011 ), Dell Inc. accounted for 15% of our net revenue ( 14% in 2012 and 15% in 2011 ), and Lenovo Group Limited accounted for 12% of our net revenue ( 11% in 2012 and 9% in 2011 ). No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue during such periods. For information about net revenue and operating income by operating segment, and net revenue from unaffiliated customers by country, see  Note 27: Operating Segments and Geographic Information  in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Sales Arrangements Our products are sold through sales offices throughout the world. Sales of our products are typically made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, private-label branding, and other matters. Most of our sales are made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology. Our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer, even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related cost of sales is deferred. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, generally 30 days after shipment or delivery. Our credit department sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual customers to control credit risk to Intel arising from outstanding account balances. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis, and from this analysis, we establish credit limits and determine whether we will use one or more credit support devices, such as a parent guarantee or standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. For information about our allowance for doubtful receivables, see Schedule IIValuation and Qualifying Accounts in Part IV of this Form 10-K. Most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. On most products, there is no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. We have the option to grant credit for, repair, or replace defective products, and there is no contractual limit on the amount of credit that may be granted to a distributor for defective products. Distribution Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. We also utilize third-party sales representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others. Sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory; instead, their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers. Backlog Over time, our larger customers have generally moved to lean-inventory or just-in-time operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products. As our customers continue to lower their inventories, our processes to fulfill their orders have evolved to meet their needs. As a result, our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance non-binding commitments from customers as to future purchases. Our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Only a small portion of our orders is non-cancelable, and the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant. Seasonal Trends Historically, our platform sales have generally been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. Marketing Our corporate marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known Intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel Atom, Intel  Pentium  , Intel Xeon, Intel Xeon Phi and Intel  Itanium  trademarks make up our processor brands. We promote brand awareness and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities include television, print, and Internet advertising, as well as press relations and social media, consumer and trade events, and industry and consumer communications. We market to consumer and business audiences, and focus on building awareness and generating demand for new form factors such as Ultrabook and 2 in 1 systems, and for increased performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as Internet connectivity and security. Purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the Intel Inside  Program. This program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Through the Intel Inside Program, certain customers are licensed to place Intel logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses the OEMs for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to the OEMs meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include television, print, and Internet marketing. We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers. Intellectual Property Rights and Licensing Intel owns significant intellectual property (IP) around the world that relates to our products, services, research and development, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress rights, and maskwork rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. Such efforts can be difficult, however, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, and  Note 26: Contingencies  in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We have obtained patents in the U.S. and other countries. While our patents are an important element of our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, and the comparative pace of governments patenting processes, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire; in some cases, our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are granted. As we expand our products into new industries, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products. In addition to developing patents based on our own research and development efforts, we purchase patents from third parties to supplement our patent portfolio. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other IP, may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our component-level and platform products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. Compliance with Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations Our compliance efforts focus on monitoring regulatory and resource trends and setting company-wide performance targets for key resources and emissions. These targets address several parameters, including product design; chemical, energy, and water use; waste recycling; the source of certain minerals used in our products; climate change; and emissions. As a company, we focus on reducing natural resource use, the solid and chemical waste by-products of our manufacturing processes, and the environmental impact of our products. We currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of EHS laws and regulations. Over the past several years, we have significantly reduced the use of lead and halogenated flame retardants in our products and manufacturing processes. We work with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), OEMs, and retailers to help manage e-waste (including electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives) and to promote recycling. The European Union requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that let consumers return products for recycling. Many states in the U.S. have similar e-waste take-back laws. Although these laws are typically targeted at the end electronic product and not the component products that we manufacture, the inconsistency of many e-waste take-back laws and the lack of local e-waste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts. We are an industry leader in our efforts to build ethical sourcing of minerals for our products, including conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. In 2013, we accomplished our goal to manufacture microprocessors that are DRC conflict free for tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold. In 2014, we will continue our work to establish DRC conflict free supply chains for these minerals for our company and our industry. We seek to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers to improve energy efficiency. We take a holistic approach to power management, addressing the challenge at the silicon, package, circuit, micro-architecture, macro architecture, platform, and software levels. We recognize that climate change may cause general economic risk. For further information on the risks of climate change, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We see a potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations. This could include items applied to utility companies that are passed along to customers, such as carbon taxes or costs associated with obtaining permits for our manufacturing operations, emission cap and trade programs, or renewable portfolio standards. We are committed to sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives and working proactively with governments, environmental groups, and industry to promote global environmental sustainability. We believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the worlds environmental challenges, and we are joining forces with industry, business, and governments to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to combat climate change. We have been purchasing wind power and other forms of renewable energy at some of our major sites for several years. We purchase renewable energy certificates under a multi-year contract. This purchase has placed Intel at the top of the EPAs Green Power Partnership for the past four years and is intended to help stimulate the market for green power, leading to additional generating capacity and, ultimately, lower costs. Distribution of Company Information Our Internet address is www.intel.com . We publish voluntary reports on our web site that outline our performance with respect to corporate responsibility, including EHS compliance.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END Changes in product demand may harm our financial results and are hard to predict. If product demand decreases, our revenue and profit could be harmed. Important factors that could cause demand for our products to decrease include changes in: ##TABLE_START  business conditions, including downturns in the computing industry, regional economies, and the overall economy; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  consumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the level of customers inventories; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  customer product needs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  market acceptance of our products and maturing product cycles; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the technology supply chain, including supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. ##TABLE_END Our operations have high costsincluding costs related to facility construction and equipment, RD, and employment and training of a highly skilled workforcethat are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. At the same time, demand for our products is highly variable and, in recent years, we have experienced declining orders in the traditional PC market segment, which has been negatively impacted by the growth in ultra-mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones . If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. Our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. Factory-planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation. If product demand increases, we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand. Our revenue and gross margin percentage can also be affected by the timing of our product introductions and related expenses, including marketing expenses. Changes in product demand, and changes in our customers product needs, could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us to write down our assets. We operate in highly competitive industries, and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological and market developments could harm our ability to compete. We operate in highly competitive industries that experience rapid technological and market developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to these developments, we might weaken our competitive position, and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete. As computing market segments emerge, such as smartphones, tablets, and consumer electronics devices, we face new sources of competition and customers with needs different from those of customers in the PC market segment. Some of our competitors are pursuing a vertical integration strategy, incorporating their SoC solutions into the smartphones and tablets they offer, which could make it less likely that they will adopt our SoC solutions. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships in these market segments. As the number and variety of Internet-connected devices increase, we need to continuously improve the cost, connectivity, integration, features, energy efficiency, and security of our platforms, among other things, to succeed in these market segments. In addition, we need to expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful RD effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors. For example, we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing, assembly and test facilities, including the construction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers. Our RD efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems, and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, and the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers. Our RD investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. Additionally, the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for or pricing of our products. These types of events could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce revenue, increase costs, lower gross margin percentage, or require us to impair our assets. Changes in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results. Because of the wide price differences of platform average selling prices among our data center, PC client, and Other IA platforms, a change in the mix of platforms among these market segments may impact our revenue and gross margin. For example, our PC client platforms that are incorporated in notebook and desktop computers tend to have lower average selling prices and gross margin than our data center platforms that are incorporated in servers, workstations and storage products. Therefore, if there is less demand for our data center platforms, and a resulting mix shift to our PC client platforms, our gross margins and revenue would decrease. Also, more recently introduced products tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross margin. Our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our results of operations and financial condition. We have sales offices, RD, manufacturing, assembly and test facilities, and other facilities in many countries, and some business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas. As a result, our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products may be affected by: ##TABLE_START  security concerns, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, and terrorist activity; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  natural disasters and health concerns; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inefficient and limited infrastructure and disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, or telecommunications providers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  restrictions on our operations by governments seeking to support local industries, nationalization of our operations, and restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  differing employment practices and labor issues; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations. ##TABLE_END Legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, or agents may violate our policies. Although most of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses may be paid in local currencies. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in tariff and import regulations and in U.S. and non-U.S. monetary policies may harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our expenses and reducing revenue. Differing tax rates in various jurisdictions could harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our overall tax rate. We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. We place our insurance coverage with multiple carriers in numerous jurisdictions. However, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies have deductibles and exclusions that result in us retaining a level of self-insurance. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Failure to meet our production targets, resulting in undersupply or oversupply of products, may harm our business and results of operations. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. Disruptions in this process can result from errors, difficulties in our development and implementation of new processes, defects in materials, disruptions in our supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditionsall of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. We may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes. Production issues may result in our failure to meet or increase production as desired, resulting in higher costs or large decreases in yields, which could affect our ability to produce sufficient volume to meet product demand. The unavailability or reduced availability of products could make it more difficult to deliver computing platforms. The occurrence of these events could harm our business and results of operations. We may have difficulties obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing, assembling and testing our products, or operating other aspects of our business, which could harm our ability to meet demand and increase our costs. We have thousands of suppliers providing materials that we use in production and other aspects of our business, and where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials. However, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location, for these materials. The inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. Production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. Future environmental regulations could restrict the supply or increase the cost of materials that we use in our business and make it more difficult to obtain permits to build or modify manufacturing capacity to meet demand. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs. The occurrence of these events could harm our business and results of operations. Costs related to product defects and errata may harm our results of operations and business. Costs of product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) due to, for example, problems in our design and manufacturing processes, could include: ##TABLE_START  writing off the value of inventory; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  disposing of products that cannot be fixed; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  recalling products that have been shipped; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  providing product replacements or modifications; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  defending against litigation. ##TABLE_END These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin. Our reputation with customers or end users could be damaged as a result of product defects and errata, and product demand could be reduced. The announcement of product defects and errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of Intel components or for other reasons. These factors could harm our business and financial results. Third parties might attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network or seek to compromise our products and services, which could damage our reputation and financial results. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our IT systems. Additionally, malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide. These attempts might be the result of industrial or other espionage or actions by hackers seeking to harm our company, our products and services, or users of our products and services. Due to the widespread use of our products and due to the high profile of our McAfee subsidiary, we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others. We believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication. These attacks are sometimes successful; and in some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We seek to detect and investigate such attempts and incidents and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and/or changes or patches to our products and services, but in some cases preventive and remedial action might not be successful. Such attacks, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in our incurring costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, reduced inventory value, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. Publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. We may be subject to theft, loss or misuse of personal data about us or our employees, customers or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation or result in litigation. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Costs to comply with and implement privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. Our failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. Third parties may claim infringement of IP rights, which could harm our business. We may face IP rights infringement claims from individuals and companies, including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies. We are engaged in a number of litigation matters involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others could cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. As a result of IP rights infringement claims, we could: ##TABLE_START  pay monetary damages for infringement claims; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products or technology subject to infringement claims; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  develop other products or technology not subject to infringement claims, which could be time-consuming, costly or impossible; or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  license technology from the party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. ##TABLE_END These actions could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed. We may be unable to enforce or protect our IP rights, which may harm our ability to compete and may harm our business. Our ability to enforce our patents, copyrights, software licenses, and other IP rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we are often subject to claims that the IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to the opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights often results in the other party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. Governments may adopt regulationsand governments or courts may render decisionsrequiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business. We may be subject to IP theft or misuse, which could result in claims against us and harm our business and results of operations. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; the value of our investment in RD, product development, and marketing could be reduced. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of third party trade secrets and other confidential business information that we obtain in conducting our business might lead to third-party claims against us related to the loss of the confidential or proprietary information or end-user data. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm. Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights. Companies in the computing industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements between them. Our competitors may have licenses to our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired. In addition, we may not be able to obtain licenses on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms to patents asserted to be essential to standards that we implement in our products. Litigation or regulatory proceedings could harm our business. We may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. As described in  Note 26: Contingencies  in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling products, engaging in business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added resellers, OEMs, Internet service providers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors). Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk, and compliance risks. Distributors may sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of FCPA or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position. We face risks related to sales to government entities. We derive a portion of our revenue from sales to government entities and their respective agencies. Government demand and payment for our products may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations. Government contracts are subject to oversight, including special rules on accounting, expenses, reviews, and security. Failing to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines and suspensions, or debarment from future government business. We invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments. We make investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. These investments include equity or debt instruments of public or private companies, and many of these instruments are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. Companies range from early-stage companies that are still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The companies in which we invest may fail because they are unable to secure additional funding, obtain favorable terms for future financings, or participate in liquidity events such as public offerings, mergers, and private sales. If any of these companies fail, we could lose all or part of our investment. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment, we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize a loss, impacting gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies. The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies have a large impact on our results of operations. For more information, see Critical Accounting Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. These methods, estimates, and judgments are subject to large risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and changes could affect our results of operations. Changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations. A number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including: ##TABLE_START  the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the resolution of issues arising from tax audits; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairments of goodwill; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in available tax credits; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of non-U.S income and expenses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. ##TABLE_END 21 Decisions about the scope of operations of our business could affect our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in the business environment could lead to changes in the scope of our operations, resulting in restructuring and asset impairment charges in addition to those announced in the last twelve months. Factors that could affect our results of operations and financial condition due to a change in the scope of our operations include: ##TABLE_START  timing and execution of plans and programs subject to local labor law requirements, including consultation with work councils; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in assumptions related to severance and postretirement costs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  divestitures; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  new business initiatives and changes in product roadmap, development, and manufacturing; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in employment levels and turnover rates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in product demand and the business environment; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the fair value of long-lived assets. ##TABLE_END Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and enter into agreements for possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions, such as joint ventures. Acquisitions and other transactions involve large challenges and risks, including risks that: ##TABLE_START  we may be unable to identify opportunities on terms acceptable to us; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the transaction may not advance our business strategy; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may not realize a satisfactory return; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may be unable to retain key personnel; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may experience difficulty in integrating new employees, business systems, and technology; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  acquired businesses may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our due diligence process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may have difficulty entering new market segments; or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may be unable to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses. ##TABLE_END When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed-upon terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur added expense, or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, resulting in a loss on the transaction. If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to factors such as: ##TABLE_START  failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  IP disputes or other litigation; or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulties obtaining financing for the transaction. ##TABLE_END Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could harm our business and results of operations. The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of EHS laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in: ##TABLE_START  regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  suspension of production; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  alteration of our fabrication and assembly and test processes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reputational challenges; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  restrictions on our operations or sales. ##TABLE_END Our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes. In addition, the SEC has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals (commonly referred to as tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold) in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements in the event that the materials come from the DRC or adjoining countries. The European Union and other foreign jurisdictions may in the future also enact rules regarding conflict minerals, which could potentially cover additional minerals or locations where minerals originate. Due to the complexity of our supply chain, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the conflict minerals used in our products. Climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. In addition to the possible direct economic impact that climate change could have on us, climate change mitigation programs and regulations can increase our costs. The cost of perfluorocompounds (PFCs)a gas that we use in manufacturingcould increase under some climate-change-focused emissions trading programs that may be imposed through regulation. If the use of PFCs is prohibited, we would need to obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. Air-quality permit requirements for our manufacturing operations could become more burdensome and cause delays in our ability to modify or build additional manufacturing capacity. Under recently adopted greenhouse gas regulations in the U.S., many of our manufacturing facilities have become major sources under the Clean Air Act. At a minimum, this change in status results in some uncertainty as the EPA adopts guidance on its greenhouse gas regulations. Due to the dynamic nature of our operations, these regulations will likely result in increased costs for our U.S. operations. These cost increases could be associated with new air pollution control requirements, and increased or new monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. We also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations. Our costs could increase if utility companies pass on their costs, such as those associated with carbon taxes, emission cap and trade programs, or renewable portfolio standards. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disasters or events. Many of our operations are located in semi-arid regions, such as Israel and the southwestern U.S. Some scenarios predict that these regions may become even more vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. In order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate key employees, and our failure to do so could harm our results of operations. In order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees in the semiconductor industry can be intense. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. A number of factors could lower interest and other, net harming our results of operations. Factors that could lower interest and other, net in our consolidated statements of income include changes in fixed-income, equity, and credit markets; foreign currency exchange rates; interest rates; credit standing of financial instrument counterparties; our cash and investment balances; and our indebtedness. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls.  We do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

We expect that this new facility will allow us to widen our process technology lead. We also completed construction of a large-scale fabrication building in Arizona in 2013, which is currently not in use and is not being depreciated. We recently announced that we plan to delay equipment installation in this building and leverage existing fabrication facilities, reserving this new facility for additional capacity and future technologies. Outside the U.S., we have wafer fabrication facilities in Israel, China, and Ireland. Our fabrication facility in Ireland is currently transitioning to a newer process technology node, with manufacturing expected to recommence in 2015. Our assembly and test facilities are located in Malaysia, China, Costa Rica, and Vietnam . In addition, we have sales and marketing offices worldwide that are generally located near major concentrations of customers. We believe that the facilities described above are suitable and adequate for our present purposes and that the productive capacity in our facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize it. We do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment.

PCCG experienced lower platform unit sales in the first half of the year, but saw offsetting growth in the back half as the PC market began to show signs of stabilization. DCG continued to benefit from the build out of Internet cloud computing and the strength of our product portfolio resulting in increased platform volumes for DCG for the year. Higher factory start-up costs for our next-generation 14nm process technology led to a decrease in gross margin compared to 2012. In response to the current business environment and to better align resources, management approved several restructuring actions including targeted workforce reductions as well as the exit of certain businesses and facilities. These actions resulted in restructuring and asset impairment charges of $240 million for 2013 . MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our Q4 2013 revenue of $13.8 billion was up 3% from Q3 2013. The sequential increase was a result of stabilization in the PC market which generated 3% higher platform unit sales for PCCG. Gross margin remained flat sequentially as lower platform unit costs were offset by higher factory start-up costs for our 14nm process technology. The platform unit cost decline is attributable to our 22nm process technology coming down the cost curve as we ramp the 4th generation Intel Core processor family products in multiple fabrication facilities. In 2013, we introduced many new product technologies across all of our businesses. Our product launches included the 4th generation Intel Core processor family, Intel Xeon 22nm processors, and Intel Atom microarchitecture platforms. As 2013 progressed, we shifted our focus and investment strategy in order to increase our cadence for bringing innovative products to market. One example is the announcement of Intel Quark SoC which is an ultra-low power and cost architecture designed for the Internet of Things, from industrial machines to future wearable devices .  The cash generation from our business remained strong with cash from operations of $20.8 billion in 2013. We ended the year with an investment portfolio of $20.1 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets. We returned $4.5 billion to stockholders through dividends and repurchased $2.1 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. We purchased $10.7 billion in capital assets as we continued making investments in new architectures and product offerings. In January 2014, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.225 per common share to be paid in Q1 2014 . Looking ahead to 2014, we expect revenue and gross margin to remain flat. We believe our product offerings and architectures will enable innovation and allow for future growth in the PC market through all-in-ones, 2 in 1s, convertibles and detachables. The launch of new low-power, high-performance products will continue to expand our footprint in tablets and our Internet of Things business. We also continue to make progress with the industrys first 14nm manufacturing process and our second generation 3-D transistors (code-named Broadwell). Our second generation 3-D transistors will begin production in Q1 2014 and is expected to launch in the second half of 2014. As we continue to align resources to focus on tablets, low-power SoCs, and the data center, we will also streamline our overall investment position in order to hold spending flat for the year.  Our Business Outlook for Q1 2014 and full-year 2014 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (RD plus MGA), and capital expenditures. We will keep our most current Business Outlook publicly available on our Investor Relations web site www.intc.com . This Business Outlook is not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the Business Outlook or in this Form 10-K. The statements in the Business Outlook and forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times. The forward-looking statements in the Business Outlook will be effective through the close of business on March 14, 2014, unless updated earlier. From the close of business on March 14, 2014, until our quarterly earnings release is published, currently scheduled for April 15, 2014, we will observe a quiet period. During the quiet period, the Business Outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our Form 8-K filed on January 16, 2014, and other forward-looking statements disclosed in the company's news releases and filings with the SEC, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this Form 10-K, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. During the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our Business Outlook or our financial results or expectations. The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Critical Accounting Estimates The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: ##TABLE_START  the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity investments, net when we record impairments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment; goodwill; and identified intangibles), which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment. ##TABLE_END In the following section, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. Non-Marketable Equity Investments We regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $2.3 billion as of December 28, 2013 ( $2.2 billion as of December 29, 2012 ). Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. Our non-marketable equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success depends on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business factors. The companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings. These events could cause our investments to become impaired. In addition, financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. For further information about our investment portfolio risks, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for disclosure purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as projected revenue, earnings, and comparable performance multiples. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies sizes, growth rates, industries, and development stages. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates regarding the investees' revenue, costs, and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available market, historical, and forecast data. The valuation of these non-marketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, the investees capital structures, the terms of the investees issued interests, and the lack of marketability of the investments. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) For non-marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment, such as: ##TABLE_START  the investees revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the technological feasibility of the investees products and technologies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory and economic changes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  factors related to the investees ability to remain in business, such as the investees liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. ##TABLE_END If the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value. Impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $112 million in 2013 ( $104 million in 2012 and $63 million in 2011 ). Long-Lived Assets Property, Plant and Equipment We assess property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset groupings carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. We measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset groupings carrying value and its fair value. Property, plant and equipment is considered a non-financial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. Impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets new, shorter useful lives. Based on our analysis, impairments and accelerated depreciation of our property, plant, and equipment was $172 million in 2013 ( $73 million in 2012 and $100 million in 2011 ). Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased operations to our existing business units as well as the acquired business unit. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in  Note 27: Operating Segments and Geographic Information  in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value. For reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) For reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform additional analysis. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. If we determine during the second step that the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income method and the market method to estimate a reporting units fair value. The income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following reporting unit estimates: revenue, based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share; estimated costs; and appropriate discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. Our estimates of market segment growth, our market segment share, and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and a variety of external sources. These estimates are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process. The same estimates are also used in planning for our long-term manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process, and for long-term and short-term business planning and forecasting. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data. The market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. A reporting units carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. For the annual impairment assessment in 2013 , we determined that for each of our reporting units with significant amounts of goodwill, it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value. As a result, we concluded that performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary for those reporting units. During the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years, we have completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years. Identified Intangibles We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinite-lived intangible assets, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If we determine that an individual asset is impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Based on our impairment assessment, we recognized impairment charges of $17 million in 2013 ( $21 million in 2012 and $10 million in 2011 ). Income Taxes We must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not more likely than not, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should a change occur in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery is not more likely than not. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. We have not recognized U.S. deferred income taxes on certain undistributed non-U.S. earnings because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. Remittances of non-U.S. earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our non-U.S. and U.S. operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in the various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-U.S. earnings, which would be subject to U.S. income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes. Inventory Intel has a product development lifecycle that corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities, and associated costs, change in nature from RD to cost of sales. In order for a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. This milestone is known as product release qualification (PRQ). We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. To determine which costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; therefore, it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges were $319 million in 2013 ( $540 million in 2012 and $46 million in 2011 ). Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, customer acceptance of our products, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. If the estimated market value of the inventory is less than the carrying value, we write down the inventory and record the difference as a charge to cost of sales. The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The demand forecast is utilized in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. The estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Loss Contingencies We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and asserted and potential claims, as well as accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata and product warranties that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred. The outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims, and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments, are subject to significant uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. With respect to estimating the losses associated with repairing and replacing parts in connection with product errata, we make judgments with respect to the return rates to our customers, our customers' return rates, and the costs to repair or replace parts. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter, and we may revise our estimates. These revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Accounting Changes For a description of accounting changes, see  Note 3: Accounting Changes  in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

The PCCG and DCG platform unit sales decreased by 3%. Additionally, lower netbook platform and feature and entry phone component unit sales contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher PCCG and DCG platform average selling prices, which were up 2%, as well as higher ISG platform average selling prices. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2013 decreased by $1.6 billion, or 5%, compared to 2012. The decrease was due in large part to $1.8 billion of higher factory start-up costs primarily for our next-generation 14nm process technology. To a lesser extent, lower overall revenue from our Other IA operating segments, primarily in our phone and mobile component businesses and netbook group, as well as lower PCCG and DCG platform revenue contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher ISG platform revenue, approximately $325 million of lower PCCG and DCG platform unit costs, and $221 million of lower excess capacity charges. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 59.8% in 2013 from 62.1% in 2012. The decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin percentage decrease in PCCG. We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2013 and 2012 from the sale of platforms in the PCCG and DCG operating segments. Our net revenue for 2012, which included 52 weeks, decreased by $658 million, or 1%, compared to 2011, which included 53 weeks. The PCCG and DCG platform unit sales decreased 1% while average selling prices were unchanged. Additionally, lower netbook platform unit sales and Multi-Comm average selling prices, primarily discrete modems, contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by our McAfee operating segment, which we acquired in the Q1 2011. McAfee contributed $469 million of additional revenue in 2012 compared to 2011. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2012 decreased by $606 million, or 2%, compared to 2011. The decrease was due in large part to $494 million of excess capacity charges, as well as lower revenue from the PCCG and DCG platform. To a lesser extent, approximately $390 million of higher unit costs on the PCCG and DCG platform as well as lower netbook and Multi-Comm revenue contributed to the decrease. The decrease was partially offset by $643 million of lower factory start-up costs as we transition from our 22nm process technology to RD of our next-generation 14nm process technology, as well as $422 million of charges recorded in 2011 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel  6 Series Express Chipset family. The decrease was also partially offset by the two additional months of results from our acquisition of McAfee, which occurred on February 28, 2011, contributing approximately $334 million of additional gross margin dollars in 2012 compared to 2011. The amortization of acquisition-related intangibles resulted in a $557 million reduction to our overall gross margin dollars in 2012, compared to $482 million in 2011, primarily due to acquisitions completed in Q1 2011. Our overall gross margin percentage in 2012 was flat from 2011 as higher excess capacity charges and higher unit costs on the PCCG and DCG platform were offset by lower factory start-up costs and no impact in 2012 for a design issue related to our Intel 6 Series Express Chipset family. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2012 and 2011 from the sale of platforms in the PCCG and DCG operating segments. PC Client Group The revenue and operating income for the PCCG operating segment for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)    Net revenue  $ 33,039  $ 34,504  $ 35,624 Operating income  $ 11,827  $ 13,106  $ 14,840 ##TABLE_ENDNet revenue for the PCCG operating segment decreased by $1.5 billion, or 4%, in 2013 compared to 2012. PCCG platform unit sales were down 3% primarily on softness in traditional PC demand during the first nine months of the year. The decrease in revenue was driven by lower notebook and desktop platform unit sales which were down 4% and 2%, respectively. PCCG platform average selling prices were flat, with 6% higher desktop platform average selling prices offset by 4% lower notebook platform average selling prices. Operating income decreased by $1.3 billion, or 10%, in 2013 compared to 2012, which was driven by $1.5 billion of lower gross margin, partially offset by $200 million of lower operating expenses. The decrease in gross margin was driven by $1.5 billion of higher factory start-up costs primarily on our next-generation 14nm process technology as well as lower PCCG platform revenue. These decreases were partially offset by approximately $520 million of lower PCCG platform unit costs, $260 million of lower excess capacity charges, and higher sell-through of previously non-qualified units. Net revenue for the PCCG operating segment decreased by $1.1 billion, or 3%, in 2012 compared to 2011. PCCG revenue was negatively impacted by the growth of tablets as these devices compete with PCs for consumer sales. Platform average selling prices and unit sales decreased 2% and 1%, respectively. The decrease was driven by 6% lower notebook platform average selling prices and 5% lower desktop platform unit sales. These decreases were partially offset by a 4% increase in desktop platform average selling prices and a 2% increase in notebook platform unit sales. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating income decreased by $1.7 billion, or 12%, in 2012 compared to 2011 driven by $644 million of lower gross margin and $1.1 billion of higher operating expenses. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower platform revenue. Additionally, $457 million of higher excess capacity charges and approximately $350 million of higher platform unit costs contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by $785 million of lower factory start-up costs as we transition from manufacturing start-up costs related to our 22nm process technology to RD of our next-generation 14nm process technology. Additionally, the first half of 2011 included $ 422 million of charges recorded to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by the design issue related to our Intel 6 Series Express Chipset family. Data Center Group The revenue and operating income for the DCG operating segment for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)    Net revenue  $ 11,238  $ 10,511  $ 9,911 Operating income  $ 5,164  $ 5,020  $ 5,053 ##TABLE_ENDNet revenue for the DCG operating segment increased by $727 million, or 7%, in 2013 compared to 2012. DCG platform average selling prices and unit sales were up 4% and 3%, respectively. Our platform unit sales continued to benefit from growth in the Internet cloud computing and high performance computing market segments. Operating income increased $144 million, or 3%, in 2013 compared to 2012 with $148 million of higher gross margin offset by higher operating expenses. Gross margin was positively impacted by higher platform revenue, partially offset by $274 million of higher factory start-up costs for our next-generation 14nm process technology, and approximately $190 million of higher DCG platform unit costs. Net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased by $600 million, or 6%, in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase in revenue was due to 6% higher platform average selling prices, slightly offset by 1% lower platform unit sales. Our platform average selling prices benefited from significant growth in the Internet cloud computing and high performance computing market segments. This was offset by weakness in the enterprise server market segment. Operating income decreased by $33 million in 2012 compared to 2011 as $356 million of higher gross margin was more than offset by $389 million of higher operating expenses. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher platform revenue. Other Intel Architecture Operating Segments The revenue and operating income (loss) for the other Intel architecture operating segments, including ISG, Multi-Comm, the Tablet Group, the Phone Group, the Service Provider Group, the Netbook Group, and the New Devices Group for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)    Net revenue  $ 4,092  $ 4,378  $ 5,005 Operating income (loss)  $ (2,445 )  $ (1,377 )  $ (577 ) ##TABLE_ENDNet revenue for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $286 million, or 7%, in 2013 compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily due to lower netbook platform, feature and entry phone components, and Multi-Comm unit sales. To a lesser extent, lower Multi-Comm average selling prices contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher ISG revenue on increased platform average selling prices. Operating results for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $1.1 billion in 2013 compared to 2012. The decline in operating results was primarily due to approximately $590 million of higher operating expenses in the Other IA operating segments on RD investments in our smartphone and tablet products as well as higher cost of sales as we ramp our tablet business. Additionally, lower netbook platform and Multi-Comm revenue contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher ISG revenue. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net revenue for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $627 million, or 13%, in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower netbook platform unit sales and lower Multi-Comm average selling prices. To a lesser extent, lower netbook platform average selling prices contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher ISG platform average selling prices. Operating results for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $800 million from an operating loss of $577 million in 2011 to an operating loss of $1.4 billion in 2012. The decline in operating results was primarily due to lower netbook revenue and higher operating expenses in the Other IA operating segments. To a lesser extent, lower Multi-Comm revenue contributed to the decrease. Software and Services Operating Segments The revenue and operating income (loss) for the SSG operating segments, including McAfee, the Wind River Software Group, and the Software and Services Group, for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)    Net revenue  $ 2,502  $ 2,381  $ 1,870 Operating income (loss)  $  $ (11 )  $ (32 ) ##TABLE_ENDNet revenue for the SSG operating segments increased by $121 million in 2013 compared to 2012. The increase was primarily driven by higher McAfee revenue. The operating results for the SSG operating segments increased by $12 million in 2013 compared to 2012. The increase was primarily driven by higher McAfee revenue, partially offset by higher McAfee operating expenses. Net revenue for the SSG operating segments increased by $511 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to two months of incremental revenue from McAfee of $469 million. McAfee was acquired on February 28, 2011. The operating results for the SSG operating segments increased by $21 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher McAfee revenue, partially offset by higher McAfee operating expenses. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars In Millions)    Research and development (RD)  $ 10,611  $ 10,148  $ 8,350 Marketing, general and administrative (MGA)  $ 8,088  $ 8,057  $ 7,670 RD and MGA as percentage of net revenue  %  %  % Restructuring and asset impairment charges  $  $   $  Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDResearch and Development. RD spending increased by $463 million , or 5% , in 2013 compared to 2012 . The increase was driven by higher investments in our products, primarily smartphones and tablets, as well higher compensation expenses due to annual salary increases. This increase was partially offset by lower process development costs as we transitioned from RD to manufacturing for our 14nm process technology. RD spending increased by $1.8 billion , or 22% , in 2012 compared to 2011 . The increase was driven by investments in our products for smartphones, tablets, Ultrabook devices, and data centers. Additionally, RD spending increased due to higher process development costs for our 14nm process technology, higher compensation expenses mainly due to annual salary increases, additional expenses for acquisitions made in Q1 2011, and higher costs related to the development of 450mm wafer technology. Marketing, General and Administrative. MGA expenses increased by $31 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , and increased by $387 million , or 5% , in 2012 compared to 2011 . The increase in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to two additional months of McAfee expenses in 2012 and higher compensation expenses, due to annual salary increases as well as an increase in the number of employees. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. In response to the current business environment, during 2013, management approved several restructuring actions including targeted workforce reductions as well as exit of certain businesses and facilities. These actions include the wind down of our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Massachusetts, which we expect to cease production by the end of 2014. These targeted reductions will enable the company to better align our resources in areas providing the greatest benefit in the changing market . Restructuring and asset impairment charges for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)    Employee severance and benefit arrangements  $  $   $  Asset impairments      Total restructuring and asset impairment charges  $  $   $  ##TABLE_ENDThe restructuring and asset impairment activity for 2013 was as follows:  ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  Employee Severance and Benefits  Asset Impairments  Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 29, 2012  $   $   $  Additional accruals    Adjustments     Cash payments  (18 )    (18 ) Non-cash settlements    (39 )  (39 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 28, 2013  $  $   $ ##TABLE_ENDWe recorded the additional accruals and adjustments as restructuring and asset impairment charges in the consolidated statements of income within the all other operating segment. The charges incurred during 2013 include  $201 million  related to employee severance and benefit arrangements, which impacted approximately 3,900  employees. The accrued restructuring balance as of December 28, 2013 , relates to employee severance and benefits which are expected to be paid within the next 12 months and was recorded as a current liability within accrued compensation and benefits in the consolidated balance sheets.  We estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately $400 million , which will be realized within RD, cost of sales, and MGA. We began to realize these savings in Q4 2013 and expect to fully realize these savings by Q1 2015. We may incur additional charges in the future for employee severance and benefit arrangements, as well as facility-related or other exit activities, as we continue to align our resources to meet the needs of the business. Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased by $17 million , or 6% , in 2013 compared to 2012 and increased by $48 million , or 18% , in 2012 compared to 2011 . The increase in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the full year of amortization of intangibles in 2012 related to the acquisitions of McAfee and the WLS business of Infineon, both completed in Q1 2011. For further information, see  Note 8: Acquisitions  and  Note 11: Identified Intangible Assets  in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation totaled $1.1 billion in 2013 ( $1.1 billion in 2012 and $1.1 billion in 2011 ). Share-based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses. As of December 28, 2013 , unrecognized share-based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Unrecognized Share-Based Compensation Costs  Weighted Average Period Stock options  $  1.1 years Restricted stock units  $ 1,625  1.2 years ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 28, 2013 , there was $13 million in unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to the rights to acquire common stock under our stock purchase plan. We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately one and a half months. Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments and Interest and Other Gains (losses) on equity investments, net and interest and other, net for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)    Gains (losses) on equity investments, net  $  $  $ Interest and other, net  $ (151 )  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDWe recognized higher net gains on equity investments in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher gains on sales of equity investments, partially offset by lower gains on third-party merger transactions. Net gains on equity investments were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower equity method losses and higher gains on third-party merger transactions, partially offset by lower gains on sales of equity investments. Net gains on equity investments for 2013 included gains of $439 million on the sales of our interest in Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC) and our shares in Clearwire Corporation in Q3 2013. For further information on these transactions, see \" Note 5: Cash and Investments \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Net gains on equity investments for 2011 included a gain of $150 million on the sale of shares in VMware, Inc. Our share of equity method investee losses recognized in 2011 was primarily related to Clearwire LLC ( $145 million ) and these losses reduced our carrying value in Clearwire LLC to zero. We recognized an interest and other net loss in 2013 compared to a net gain in 2012. We recognized a net loss in 2013 due to an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of our $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in Q4 2012. Additionally, in Q2 2012 we received proceeds from an insurance claim related to the floods in Thailand. Interest and other, net decreased in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to a $164 million gain recognized upon formation of the Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC (Care Innovations) joint venture in Q1 2011 and higher interest expense in 2012. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Provision for Taxes Our provision for taxes and effective tax rate for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)    Income before taxes  $ 12,611  $ 14,873  $ 17,781 Provision for taxes  $ 2,991  $ 3,868  $ 4,839 Effective tax rate  23.7 %  26.0 %  27.2 % ##TABLE_ENDThe U.S. RD tax credit was reenacted in January 2013 retroactive to the beginning of 2012. The majority of the decrease in our effective tax rate was driven by the recognition of the 2012 U.S RD tax credit in Q1 2013. The effective tax rate was also positively impacted by the recognition of the 2013 impact of the U.S. RD tax credit, partially offset by a lower percentage of our profits generated in lower tax jurisdictions in 2013 compared to 2012 . We generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2012 compared to 2011 , positively impacting our effective tax rate for 2012 . This impact was partially offset by the U.S. RD tax credit that was not reinstated during 2012. Liquidity and Capital Resources ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 29, 2012 Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets  $ 20,087  $ 18,162 Other long-term investments, and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months  $ 1,873  $ Short-term and long-term debt  $ 13,446  $ 13,448 Debt as percentage of stockholders equity  23.1 %  26.3 % ##TABLE_ENDMANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Sources and Uses of Cash (In Millions)  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)    Net cash provided by operating activities  $ 20,776  $ 18,884  $ 20,963 Net cash used for investing activities  (18,073 )  (14,060 )  (10,301 ) Net cash used for financing activities  (5,498 )  (1,408 )  (11,100 ) Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents  (9 )  (3 )  Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents  $ (2,804 )  $ 3,413  $ (433 ) ##TABLE_ENDOperating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. For 2013 compared to 2012 , the $1.9 billion  increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital, partially offset by lower net income in 2013. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2013 compared to 2012 were $1.1 billion  lower due to lower income before taxes in 2013 and 2012 income tax overpayments. Changes in assets and liabilities as of December 28, 2013 , compared to December 29, 2012 , included lower income taxes payable and receivable resulting from a reduction in taxes due in 2013, and lower inventories due to the sell-through of older-generation products, partially offset by the ramp of 4th generation Intel Core Processor family products. For 2013 , our three largest customers accounted for 44% of our net revenue ( 43% in 2012 and 2011 ), with Hewlett-Packard Company accounting for 17% of our net revenue ( 18% in 2012 and 19% in 2011 ), Dell accounting for 15% of our net revenue ( 14% in 2012 and 15% in 2011 ), and Lenovo accounting for 12% of our net revenue ( 11% in 2012 and 9% in 2011 ). These three customers accounted for 34% of our accounts receivable as of December 28, 2013 ( 33% as of December 29, 2012 ). For 2012 compared to 2011 , the $2.1 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to lower net income and changes in our working capital, partially offset by adjustments for non-cash items. The adjustments for noncash items were higher due primarily to higher depreciation in 2012 compared to 2011, partially offset by increases in non-acquisition-related deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2011. Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; as well as cash used for acquisitions. The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to an increase in purchases of available-for-sale investments and a decrease in maturities and sales of trading assets, partially offset by an increase in maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments and a decrease in purchases of licensed technology and patents. Our capital expenditures were $10.7 billion in 2013 ( $11.0 billion in 2012 and $10.8 billion in 2011 ). Cash used for investing activities increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to net purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets in 2012, as compared to net maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments and trading assets in 2011, partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions. Net purchases of available-for-sale investments in 2012 included our purchase of $3.2 billion of equity securities in ASML in Q3 2012. Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The increase in cash used for financing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2012 and fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program in 2013. We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in October 2005, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to $45 billion in shares of our common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions. During 2013 , we repurchased $2.1 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program compared to $4.8 billion in 2012 . As of December 28, 2013 , $3.2 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled $1.6 billion in 2013 compared to $2.1 billion in 2012 . Our total dividend payments were $4.5 billion in 2013 compared to $4.4 billion in 2012 . We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 85 quarters. In January 2014 , our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.225 per common share for Q1 2014 . The dividend is payable on March 1, 2014 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2014 . The decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 , was primarily due to fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program and, to a lesser extent, the issuance of a higher amount of long-term debt in 2012 compared to 2011. Liquidity Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. As of December 28, 2013 , cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets totaled $20.1 billion ( $18.2 billion as of December 29, 2012 ). In addition to the $20.1 billion , we have $1.9 billion in other long-term investments, and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity. Most of our investments in debt instruments are in A/A2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated AA-/Aa3 or better . Our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion , including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2013 were $300 million , although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 28, 2013 . Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard  Poors and P-1 by Moodys as of December 28, 2013 . We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. In 2012, we utilized this shelf registration statement and issued $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale of these notes were used for general corporate purposes and to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock repurchase program. For further information on the terms of the notes, see  Note 16: Borrowings  in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. As of December 28, 2013 , $11.3 billion of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Of the $11.3 billion held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, approximately $2.1 billion was available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of December 28, 2013 . The remaining amount of non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no U.S. current or deferred taxes have been accrued and this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the U.S. and future acquisitions of non-U.S. entities. We believe our U.S. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the U.S. and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., such amounts would be subject to U.S. income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes. We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Fair Value of Financial Instruments When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligors credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. For further information, see Fair Value in  Note 2: Accounting Policies  in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Marketable Debt Instruments As of December 28, 2013 , our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $20.3 billion of marketable debt instruments. Of these instruments, $7.2 billion was classified as Level 1, $13.0 billion as Level 2, and $59 million as Level 3. Our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active. Of the $13.0 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2, approximately 60% was classified as Level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model, and approximately 40% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data. Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3, are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Loans Receivable and Reverse Repurchase Agreements As of December 28, 2013 , our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $805 million of loans receivable and $400 million of reverse repurchase agreements. All of these investments were classified as Level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Marketable Equity Securities As of December 28, 2013 , our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $6.2 billion of marketable equity securities. All of these securities were classified as Level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 28, 2013 : ##TABLE_START    Payments Due by Period (In Millions)  Total  Less Than 1 Year  13 Years  35 Years  More Than 5 Years Operating lease obligations  $  $  $  $  $ Capital purchase obligations 1  5,503  5,375     Other purchase obligations and commitments 2  1,859     Long-term debt obligations 3  22,372   2,360  3,761  15,822 Other long-term liabilities 4, 5  1,496     Total 6  $ 32,100  $ 7,353  $ 4,190  $ 4,378  $ 16,179 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 28, 2013 , as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2  Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include agreements to fund various projects with other companies. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $188 million of long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the preceding table. However, long-term income taxes payable, recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non-U.S. income taxes. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 5  Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Expected required contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $62 million to be made during 2014 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2014 are not practicable to estimate. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 6  Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. ##TABLE_END Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services, included in other purchase obligations and commitments in the preceding table, include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements are not included in the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the preceding table. These obligations include milestone-based co-marketing agreements, contingent funding/payment obligations, and milestone-based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party. During 2012, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML intended to accelerate the development of 450mm wafer technology and EUV lithography . Intel agreed to provide RD funding totaling 829 million over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from ASML. Our remaining obligation, contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, is approximately 738 million , or $1.0 billion , as of December 28, 2013 . As our obligation is contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, we have not included this obligation in the preceding table. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is not included in the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest. The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements As of December 28, 2013 , we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END We are affected by changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of the potential changes presented below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 28, 2013 , and December 29, 2012 . Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange Rates In general, we economically hedge currency risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases is incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, and the Israeli shekel. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs. These programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements . For further information, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $40 million as of December 28, 2013 (less than $80 million as of December 29, 2012 ). Interest Rates We generally hedge interest rate risks of fixed-rate debt instruments with interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments. We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and indebtedness. Our indebtedness includes our debt issuances and the liability associated with a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA Corporation. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately $1.1 billion as of December 28, 2013 (an increase of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 29, 2012 ). A hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 1.0% , after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $10 million as of December 28, 2013 (an increase of approximately $10 million as of December 29, 2012 ). The fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in the fair value of our net investment position. For further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, see  Note 4: Fair Value  in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Equity Prices Our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities at the inception of the investment. Before we enter into hedge arrangements, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors, as well as the expected timing of disposal to determine whether hedging is appropriate. Our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives. We also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains and losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses and gains on the related liabilities . As of December 28, 2013 , the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $6.3 billion ( $4.4 billion as of December 29, 2012 ). Our marketable equity investment in ASML was carried at a total fair market value of $5.9 billion , or 94% of our marketable equity portfolio, as of December 28, 2013 . Our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed necessary. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a loss of 25% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $1.6 billion , based on the value as of December 28, 2013 (a decrease in value of approximately $1.6 billion , based on the value as of December 29, 2012 using an assumed loss of 35% ). Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity investments, excluding investments accounted for under the equity method, had a carrying amount of $1.3 billion as of December 28, 2013 ( $1.2 billion as of December 29, 2012 ). The carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $1.0 billion as of December 28, 2013 ( $1.0 billion as of December 29, 2012 ). The majority of our non-marketable equity method investments balance as of December 28, 2013 , was concentrated in our IMFT investment of $646 million ( $642 million as of December 29, 2012 ). ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Note 1: Basis of Presentation  We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2013 and 2012 were 52-week years. Fiscal year 2011 was a 53-week year. The next 53-week year will end on December 31, 2016. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Intel Corporation and our subsidiaries. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We use the equity method to account for equity investments in instances in which we own common stock or similar interests and have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. In the first quarter of 2011, we completed the acquisition of McAfee, Inc. (McAfee). For further information, see  Note 8: Acquisitions . Certain of the operations acquired from McAfee have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, we have recorded translation adjustments through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) beginning in 2011. Note 2: Accounting Policies  Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The accounting estimates that require our most significant, difficult, and subjective judgments include: ##TABLE_START  the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment; goodwill; and identified intangibles); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the valuation of inventory; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies. ##TABLE_END The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. Fair Value Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value, except for equity method investments, cost method investments, cost method loans receivable, and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months. Most of our liabilities are not measured and recorded at fair value. Fair Value Hierarchy The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data. For further discussion of fair value, see  Note 4: Fair Value  and  Note 17: Retirement Benefit Plans . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of approximately three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can include investments such as asset-backed securities, bank deposits, commercial paper, corporate bonds, government bonds, money market fund deposits, municipal bonds, and reverse repurchase agreements classified as cash equivalents . See \" Note 4: Fair Value \" for the instruments held as cash equivalents. Trading Assets Marketable debt instruments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument, or when the marketable debt instrument itself is used to economically hedge foreign exchange rate risk from remeasurement. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. The gains or losses of these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net. We also designate certain floating-rate securitized financial instruments, primarily asset-backed securities, as trading assets. Available-for-Sale Investments We consider all liquid available-for-sale debt instruments with original maturities from the date of purchase of approximately three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Available-for-sale debt instruments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Available-for-sale debt instruments with remaining maturities beyond one year are classified as other long-term investments. Investments that we designate as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except as noted in the Other-Than-Temporary Impairment section that follows. We determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level. Our available-for-sale investments include: ##TABLE_START  Marketable debt instruments when the interest rate and foreign currency risks are not hedged at the inception of the investment or when our criteria for designation as trading assets are not met. We generally hold these debt instruments to generate a return commensurate with the U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR. We record the interest income and realized gains and losses on the sale of these instruments in interest and other, net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketable equity securities when there is no plan to sell or hedge the investment at the time of original classification. We acquire these equity investments to promote business and strategic objectives. To the extent that these investments continue to have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks through hedging activities. We record the realized gains or losses on the sale or exchange of marketable equity securities in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END Non-Marketable and Other Equity Investments Our non-marketable equity and other equity investments are included in other long-term assets. We account for non-marketable equity and other equity investments for which we do not have control over the investee as: ##TABLE_START  Equity method investments when we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Equity method investments include marketable and non-marketable investments. Our proportionate share of the income or loss is recognized on a one-quarter lag and is recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-marketable cost method investments when the equity method does not apply. We record the realized gains or losses on the sale of non-marketable cost method investments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END 56 INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Our available-for-sale investments and non-marketable and other equity investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. Investments are considered impaired when the fair value is below the investments adjusted cost basis. Impairments affect earnings as follows: ##TABLE_START  Marketable debt instruments when the fair value is below amortized cost and we intend to sell the instrument, or when it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument (that is, a credit loss exists). When we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument, we separate other-than-temporary impairments into amounts representing credit losses, which are recognized in interest and other, net, and amounts related to all other factors, which are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketable equity securities based on the specific facts and circumstances present at the time of assessment, which include the consideration of general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is below cost, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of value in the foreseeable future. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and the business outlook for, the investee, which may include industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and changes in the investees credit rating. We record other-than-temporary impairment charges on marketable equity securities and marketable equity method investments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-marketable equity investments based on our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment, and qualitative and quantitative analysis, including: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the investees revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the technological feasibility of the investees products and technologies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  factors related to the investees ability to remain in business, such as the investees liquidity and debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. ##TABLE_END We record other-than-temporary impairment charges for non-marketable cost method investments and equity method investments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Derivative Financial Instruments Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk, commodity price risk, and credit risk. Our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. Our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for designation as a cash flow hedge. A designated hedge with exposure to variability in the functional currency equivalent of the future foreign currency cash flows of a forecasted transaction is one example of a cash flow hedge. The criteria for designating a derivative as a cash flow hedge include the assessment of the instruments effectiveness in risk reduction, matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction, and the assessment of the probability that the underlying transaction will occur. For derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction. Derivatives that we designate as cash flow hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from operating activities. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) We recognize gains and losses from changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes in the line item on the consolidated statements of income most closely associated with the related exposures, primarily in interest and other, net and gains (losses) on equity investments, net. As part of our strategic investment program, we also acquire equity derivative instruments, such as equity conversion rights associated with debt instruments, that we do not designate as hedging instruments. We recognize the gains or losses from changes in fair value of these equity derivative instruments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Gains and losses from derivatives not designated as hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within cash flows from operating activities. Measurement of Effectiveness ##TABLE_START  Effectiveness for forwards is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the fair value of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item. For currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to capital purchases, forward points are excluded, and effectiveness is measured using spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item. For currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to operating expenditures, forward points are included and effectiveness is measured using forward rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Effectiveness for options is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of an option instrument representing the hedged risks in the hedged item. Time value is excluded and effectiveness is measured using spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Effectiveness for interest rate swaps and commodity swaps is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the swap with the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item. ##TABLE_END If a cash flow hedge is discontinued because it is probable that the original hedged transaction will not occur as previously anticipated, the cumulative unrealized gain or loss on the related derivative is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. Subsequent gains or losses on the related derivative instrument are recognized in interest and other, net in each period until the instrument matures, is terminated, is re-designated as a qualified cash flow hedge, or is sold. Ineffective portions of cash flow hedges, as well as amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, are recognized in earnings in interest and other, net. For further discussion of our derivative instruments and risk management programs, see  Note 6: Derivative Financial Instruments . Securities Lending We may enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions, generally to facilitate hedging and certain investment transactions. Selected securities may be loaned, secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investment assets on our consolidated balance sheets. For lending agreements collateralized by cash and cash equivalents, collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. For lending agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the collateral as an asset or a liability, unless the collateral is repledged. Loans Receivable We make loans to third parties that are classified within other current assets or other long-term assets. We may elect the fair value option for loans when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. We record the gains or losses on these loans arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate, currency, and counterparty credit changes, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments, in interest and other, net. Loans that are denominated in U.S. dollars and have a floating-rate coupon are carried at amortized cost. We measure interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method, which is based on the effective yield of the loans rather than the stated coupon rate. For further discussion of our loans receivable, see  Note 4: Fair Value . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Inventories We compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory beginning in the quarter in which a product meets the technical criteria to qualify for sale to customers. Prior to qualification for sale, costs that do not meet the criteria for research and development (RD) are included in cost of sales in the period incurred. Inventories at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 29, 2012 Raw materials  $  $ Work in process  1,998  2,219 Finished goods  1,716  2,037 Total inventories  $ 4,172  $ 4,734 ##TABLE_ENDProperty, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, net at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 29, 2012 Land and buildings  $ 21,098  $ 18,807 Machinery and equipment  40,540  39,033 Construction in progress  11,778  8,206 Total property, plant and equipment, gross  73,416  66,046 Less: accumulated depreciation  (41,988 )  (38,063 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net  $ 31,428  $ 27,983 ##TABLE_ENDWe compute depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method. Substantially all of our depreciable property, plant and equipment assets are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment, 2 to 4 years; buildings, 10 to 25 years. We capitalize a majority of interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment. Goodwill We record goodwill when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets as of the date of acquisition, assigning the goodwill to our applicable reporting units based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition. We perform a quarterly review of goodwill for indicators of impairment. During the fourth quarter of each year, we perform an impairment assessment for each reporting unit, and we perform impairment tests using a fair value approach when necessary. The reporting units carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. For further discussion of goodwill, see  Note 10: Goodwill . Identified Intangible Assets Licensed technology and patents are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods of benefit. We amortize all acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life based on economic benefit. Acquisition-related in-process RD assets represent the fair value of incomplete RD projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition; initially, these are classified as other intangible assets that are not subject to amortization. Assets related to projects that have been completed are transferred from other intangible assets to acquisition-related developed technology; these are subject to amortization, while assets related to projects that have been abandoned are impaired and expensed to RD. In the quarter following the period in which identified intangible assets become fully amortized, we remove the fully amortized balances from the gross asset and accumulated amortization amounts. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The estimated useful life ranges for substantially all identified intangible assets that are subject to amortization as of December 28, 2013 , were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Years)  Estimated Useful Life Acquisition-related developed technology   Acquisition-related customer relationships   Acquisition-related trade names   Licensed technology and patents   ##TABLE_ENDWe perform a quarterly review of finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess recoverability by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If an assets useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinite-lived intangible assets, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If necessary, a quantitative impairment test is performed to compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying value. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. For further discussion of identified intangible assets, see  Note 11: Identified Intangible Assets . Product Warranty The vast majority of our products are sold with a limited warranty on product quality and a limited indemnification for customers against intellectual property (IP) rights infringement claims related to our products. The accrual and the related expense for known product warranty issues were not significant during the periods presented. Due to product testing, the short time typically between product shipment and the detection and correction of product failures, and the historical rate of payments on indemnification claims, the accrual and related expense for estimated incurred but unidentified issues were not significant during the periods presented. Revenue Recognition We recognize net product revenue when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, delivery has occurred, and acceptance, if applicable, as well as fixed pricing and probable collectibility. We record pricing allowances, including discounts based on contractual arrangements with customers, when we recognize revenue as a reduction to both accounts receivable and net revenue. Because of frequent sales price reductions and rapid technology obsolescence in the industry, we defer product revenue and related costs of sales from component sales made to distributors under agreements allowing price protection or right of return until the distributors sell the merchandise. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. We include shipping charges billed to customers in net revenue, and include the related shipping costs in cost of sales. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Revenue from license agreements with our McAfee business generally includes service and support agreements for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period. Revenue derived from online subscription products is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period. Professional services revenue is recognized as services are performed or, if required, upon customer acceptance. For arrangements with multiple elements, including software licenses, maintenance, and/or services, revenue is allocated across the separately identified deliverables and may be recognized or deferred. When vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) does not exist for undelivered elements such as maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Direct costs, such as costs related to revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements associated with license arrangements, as well as component costs associated with product revenue and sales commissions, are deferred and amortized over the same period that the related revenue is recognized. We record deferred revenue offset by the related cost of sales on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred income. Advertising Cooperative advertising programs reimburse customers for marketing activities for certain of our products, subject to defined criteria. We accrue cooperative advertising obligations and record the costs at the same time that the related revenue is recognized. We record cooperative advertising costs as marketing, general and administrative (MGA) expenses to the extent that an advertising benefit separate from the revenue transaction can be identified and the fair value of that advertising benefit received is determinable. We record any excess in cash paid over the fair value of the advertising benefit received as a reduction in revenue. Advertising costs, including direct marketing costs, recorded within MGA expenses were $1.9 billion in 2013 ( $2.0 billion in 2012 and $2.1 billion in 2011 ). Employee Equity Incentive Plans We have employee equity incentive plans, which are described more fully in  Note 19: Employee Equity Incentive Plans . We use the straight-line attribution method to recognize share-based compensation over the service period of the award. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock units (RSUs), we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and restricted stock units with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award. Income Taxes We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that it is believed more likely than not to be realized. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if that tax position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We then measure the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of income. For more information about income taxes, see  Note 24: Income Taxes . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 3: Accounting Changes  In the first quarter of 2012, we adopted amended standards that increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. These amended standards eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity, and they require that all changes in stockholders equityexcept investments by, and distributions to, ownersbe presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. Our adoption of these amended standards impacted the presentation of other comprehensive income, as we have elected to present two separate but consecutive statements, but it did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we adopted amended standards to simplify how we test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment; these amended standards improve consistency in impairment testing requirements among long-lived asset categories. The amended standards allow for an assessment of qualitative factors such that we can determine whether the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not to be less than its carrying value. For assets in which this assessment concludes that the fair value is more likely than not to be more than its carrying value, these amended standards eliminate the requirement to perform quantitative impairment testing as outlined in the previously issued standards. Our adoption of these amended standards did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the first quarter of 2011, we adopted new standards for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. These new standards change the determination of whether the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units for accounting purposes. Additionally, these new standards modify the method by which revenue is allocated to the separately identified deliverables. The adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the first quarter of 2011, we adopted new standards that remove certain tangible products and associated software from the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. The adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we adopted amended standards that simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment. These amended standards allow for an assessment of qualitative factors such that we can determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is more likely than not to be less than its carrying value. For reporting units in which this assessment concludes that the fair value is more likely than not to be more than its carrying value, these amended standards eliminate the requirement to perform goodwill impairment testing. Our adoption of these amended standards did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Government bonds include instruments such as non-U.S. government bonds, U.S. agency securities, and U.S. Treasury securities. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Investments in Debt Securities Debt securities reflected in the preceding table include investments such as asset-backed securities, bank deposits, commercial paper, corporate bonds, government bonds, money market fund deposits, municipal bonds, and reverse repurchase agreements classified as cash equivalents . When we use observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets, we classify our debt investments as Level 2. When observable market prices for identical securities are not available, we price our debt investments using non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data; quoted market prices for similar instruments; or pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers. These valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding and binding broker quotes; observable market prices for identical or similar securities; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and unobservable market inputs that we consider to be not significant. We corroborate non-binding market consensus prices with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exists. The discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs, such as LIBOR-based yield curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings. Debt securities classified as Level 3, are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.  Fair Value Option for Loans Receivable We elected the fair value option for loans receivable when the interest rate or currency exchange rate risk was hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. As of December 28, 2013 , the fair value of our loans receivable for which we elected the fair value option did not significantly differ from the contractual principal balance based on the contractual currency. Loans receivable are classified within other current assets and other long-term assets. Fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Gains and losses from changes in fair value on the loans receivable and related derivative instruments, as well as interest income, are recorded in interest and other, net. During all periods presented, changes in the fair value of our loans receivable were largely offset by changes in the related derivative instruments, resulting in an insignificant net impact on our consolidated statements of income. Gains and losses attributable to changes in credit risk are determined using observable credit default spreads for the issuer or comparable companies; these gains and losses were insignificant during all periods presented. We did not elect the fair value option for loans receivable when the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk was not hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. Loans receivable not measured and recorded at fair value are included in the \"Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\" section that follows. Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis Our non-marketable equity investments, marketable equity method investments, and non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. A portion of our non-marketable equity investments has been measured and recorded at fair value due to events or circumstances that significantly impacted the fair value of those investments, resulting in other-than-temporary impairment charges. We classified these investments as Level 3, as we used unobservable inputs to the valuation methodologies that were significant to the fair value measurements, and the valuations required management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices. Impairment charges recognized on non-marketable equity investments held as of December 28, 2013 , were $106 million during 2013 ( $68 million during 2012 on non-marketable equity investments held as of December 29, 2012 and $62 million during 2011 on non-marketable equity investments held as of December 31, 2011 ). The fair value of the non-marketable equity investments impaired during 2013 was $47 million at the time of impairment ( $73 million and $69 million for non-marketable equity investments impaired during 2012 and 2011 , respectively). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis On a quarterly basis, we measure the fair value of our non-marketable cost method investments, indebtedness carried at amortized cost, cost method loans receivable, grants receivable, and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months; however, the assets are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. The carrying amounts and fair values of certain financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START    December 28, 2013    Carrying Amount  Fair Value Measured Using  Fair Value (In Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Non-marketable cost method investments  $ 1,270  $   $   $ 2,105  $ 2,105 Loans receivable  $  $   $  $  $ Reverse repurchase agreements  $  $   $  $   $ Grants receivable  $  $   $  $   $ Long-term debt  $ 13,165  $ 10,937  $ 2,601  $   $ 13,538 Short-term debt  $  $   $  $   $ NVIDIA Corporation cross-license agreement liability  $  $   $  $   $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START    December 29, 2012    Carrying Amount  Fair Value Measured Using  Fair Value (In Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Non-marketable cost method investments  $ 1,202  $   $   $ 1,766  $ 1,766 Loans receivable  $  $   $  $  $ Reverse repurchase agreements  $  $   $  $   $ Grants receivable  $  $   $  $   $ Long-term debt  $ 13,136  $ 11,442  $ 2,926  $   $ 14,368 Short-term debt  $  $   $  $   $ NVIDIA Corporation cross-license agreement liability  $  $   $  $   $ ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 28, 2013 , and December 29, 2012 , the unrealized loss position of our non-marketable cost method investments was insignificant. Our non-marketable cost method investments are valued using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies sizes, growth rates, industries, and development stages. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates regarding the investees revenue, costs, and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available market, historical, and forecast data. The valuation of these non-marketable cost method investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, the investees capital structure, the terms of the investees issued interests, and the lack of marketability of the investments. The carrying amount and fair value of loans receivable exclude loans measured and recorded at a fair value of $805 million as of December 28, 2013 ( $780 million as of December 29, 2012 ). The carrying amount and fair value of short-term debt exclude drafts payable. The fair value of our loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreements, including those held at fair value, is determined using a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data, such as LIBOR-based yield curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings. The credit quality of these assets remains high, with credit ratings of A+/A1 or better for a substantial majority of our loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreements as of December 28, 2013 . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The fair value of our grants receivable is determined using a discounted cash flow model, which discounts future cash flows using an appropriate yield curve. As of December 28, 2013 , and December 29, 2012 , the carrying amount of our grants receivable was classified within other current assets and other long-term assets, as applicable. Our long-term debt recognized at amortized cost is comprised of our senior notes and our convertible debentures. The fair value of our senior notes is determined using active market prices, and it is therefore classified as Level 1. The fair value of our convertible long-term debt is determined using discounted cash flow models with observable market inputs, and it takes into consideration variables such as interest rate changes, comparable securities, subordination discount, and credit-rating changes, and it is therefore classified as Level 2. The NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA) cross-license agreement liability in the preceding table was incurred as a result of entering into a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA in January 2011. We agreed to make payments to NVIDIA over six years. As of December 28, 2013 , and December 29, 2012 , the carrying amount of the liability arising from the agreement was classified within other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, as applicable. The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model, which discounts future cash flows using our incremental borrowing rates.

Government bonds include instruments such as non-U.S. government bonds, U.S. agency securities, and U.S. Treasury securities. Bank deposits were primarily held by institutions outside the U.S. as of December 28, 2013 , and December 29, 2012 . During the third quarter of 2012, we purchased ASML Holding N.V. equity securities totaling $3.2 billion . This equity interest has been accounted for as an available-for-sale investment and is included as marketable equity securities in the preceding table. For information on the unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into the consolidated statements of income, see \" Note 25: Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) .\" We sold available-for-sale investments for proceeds of $934 million in 2013 ( $2.3 billion in 2012  and $9.1 billion in 2011 ). Proceeds received in 2013 included $142 million from the sale of our shares in Clearwire Corporation, which are included in sales of available-for-sale investments within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Substantially all of the proceeds in 2011 were from debt investments primarily used to fund our acquisition of McAfee. The gross realized gains on sales of available-for-sale investments were $146 million in 2013 ( $166 million in 2012 and $268 million in 2011 ). In 2013, we recognized a gain of $111 million on the sale of our shares in Clearwire Corporation, previously included as marketable equity securities in the preceding table. We determine the cost of an investment sold on an average cost basis at the individual security level. Impairment charges recognized on available-for-sale investments were $14 million in 2013 ( $36 million in 2012 and $73 million in 2011 ).

INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Equity Method Investments Equity method investments, classified within other long-term assets, at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START    December 28, 2013  December 29, 2012 (Dollars In Millions)  Carrying Value  Ownership Percentage  Carrying Value  Ownership Percentage IM Flash Technologies, LLC  $  %  $  % Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC   %   % Clearwire Communications, LLC     %    % Other equity method investments       Total  $ 1,038    $   ##TABLE_ENDIM Flash Technologies, LLC and IM Flash Singapore, LLP Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron) and Intel formed IM Flash Technologies, LLC (IMFT) in 2006 and IM Flash Singapore, LLP (IMFS) in 2007 to manufacture NAND flash memory products for Micron and Intel. During the second quarter of 2012, we entered into agreements with Micron that modified our joint venture relationship including an agreement to sell our ownership interest in IMFS. We received $ 605 million in the second quarter of 2012 from the sale of assets of IMFS and certain assets of IMFT to Micron. As part of the agreements to modify our joint venture relationship, we also entered into an amended operating agreement for IMFT. This amended operating agreement extends the term of IMFT to 2024, unless earlier terminated under certain terms and conditions, and provides that IMFT may manufacture certain emerging memory technologies in addition to NAND flash memory. These agreements include a supply agreement for Micron to supply us with NAND flash memory products. We provided approximately $365 million to Micron in the second quarter of 2012, primarily for subsequent product purchases under the supply agreement with Micron. The agreements also extend and expand our NAND joint development program with Micron to include emerging memory technologies. Additionally, the amended agreement provides for certain rights that, beginning in 2015, will enable us to sell to Micron, or enable Micron to purchase from us, our interest in IMFT. If Intel exercises this right, Micron would set the closing date of the transaction within two years following such election and could elect to receive financing from Intel for one to two years. IMFT is a variable interest entity. All costs of the IMFT joint venture will be passed on to Micron and Intel pursuant to our purchase agreements. Intel's portion of IMFT costs, primarily related to product purchases and production-related services, was approximately $380 million in 2013 (approximately $705 million in 2012 and approximately $985 million in 2011 for IMFT and IMFS). Subsequent to the sale of our ownership interest in IMFS in the second quarter of 2012, we no longer incur costs related to IMFS. The amount due to IMFT for product purchases and services provided was approximately $75 million as of December 28, 2013 (approximately $90 million as of December 29, 2012 ). IMFT returned $45 million to Intel in 2013 , which is reflected as a return of equity method investment within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows ( $137 million in 2012 and $263 million in 2011 ). IMFT depends on Micron and Intel for any additional cash needs. Our known maximum exposure to loss approximated the carrying value of our investment balance in IMFT, which was $646 million as of December 28, 2013 . Except for the amount due to IMFT for product purchases and services, we did not have any additional liabilities recognized on our consolidated balance sheets in connection with our interests in this joint venture as of December 28, 2013 . In addition, our potential future losses could be higher than the carrying amount of our investment, as Intel and Micron are liable for other future operating costs or obligations of IMFT. Future cash calls could also increase our investment balance and the related exposure to loss. In addition, because we are currently committed to purchasing 49% of IMFTs production output and production-related services, we may be required to purchase products at a cost in excess of realizable value. We have determined that we do not have the characteristics of a consolidating investor in the variable interest entity and, therefore, we account for our interest in IMFT (and accounted for our prior interest in IMFS) using the equity method of accounting. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC In the first quarter of 2011, Intel and General Electric Company (GE) formed Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC (Care Innovations), an equally owned joint venture in the healthcare industry, that focuses on independent living and delivery of health-related services by means of telecommunications. The company was formed by combining assets of GE Healthcares Home Health division and Intels Digital Health Group. As a result of forming Care Innovations, we recognized a gain of $164 million in the first quarter of 2011, which is included in interest and other, net on the consolidated statements of income. Care Innovations is a variable interest entity and depends on Intel and GE for any additional cash needs. Our known maximum exposure to loss approximated the carrying value of our investment balance in Care Innovations, which was $117 million as of December 28, 2013 . Intel and GE equally share the power to direct all of Care Innovations' activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. We have determined that we do not have the characteristics of a consolidating investor in the variable interest entity and, therefore, we account for our interest in Care Innovations using the equity method of accounting. Clearwire Communications, LLC In 2008, we invested in Clearwire LLC. We recognized our proportionate share of losses to the extent that our investment had a positive carrying value. We recognized equity method losses of $145 million in 2011. In the third quarter of 2013, we sold our interest in Clearwire LLC for proceeds of $328 million , which is included in other investing within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. We recognized a gain on the sale of our interest in Clearwire LLC of $328 million . Non-marketable cost method investments The carrying value of our non-marketable cost method investments was $1.3 billion as of December 28, 2013 ( $1.2 billion as of December 29, 2012 ). In 2013 , we recognized impairment charges of $103 million on non-marketable cost method investments, which is included within gains (losses) on equity investments, net on the consolidated statements of income ( $104 million in 2012 and $56 million in 2011 ). Trading Assets As of December 28, 2013 , and December 29, 2012 , all of our trading assets were marketable debt instruments. Net losses related to trading assets still held at the reporting date were $70 million in 2013 (net gains of $16 million in 2012 and net losses of $71 million in 2011 ). Net gains on the related derivatives were $86 million in 2013 (net gains of $11 million in 2012 and $58 million in 2011 ). Note 6: Derivative Financial Instruments  Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk and commodity price risk. We also enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. For presentation on our consolidated balance sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to currency exchange rate risk and generally hedge our exposures with currency forward contracts, currency interest rate swaps, or currency options. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases is incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, and the Israeli shekel. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. Our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable are generally hedged with offsetting currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. We may also hedge foreign currency risk arising from funding foreign currency denominated forecasted investments. These programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Our currency risk management programs include: ##TABLE_START  Currency derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize currency forward contracts and currency options to hedge exposures to the variability in the U.S.-dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S.-dollar-denominated cash flows. These instruments generally mature within 12 months. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and we reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Currency derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities, non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets, and hedges of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated loans receivable recognized at fair value. The majority of these instruments mature within 12 months. Changes in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of the underlying assets and liabilities are approximately offset by the changes in fair value of the related derivatives. We record net gains or losses in the line item on the consolidated statements of income most closely associated with the related exposures, primarily in interest and other, net, except for equity-related gains or losses, which we primarily record in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END Interest Rate Risk Our primary objective for holding investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields. We generally swap the returns on our investments in fixed-rate debt instruments with remaining maturities longer than six months into U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns, unless management specifically approves otherwise. These swaps are settled at various interest payment times involving cash payments at each interest and principal payment date, with the majority of the contracts having quarterly payments. Our interest rate risk management programs include: ##TABLE_START  Interest rate derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest characteristics of debt instruments. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and we reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interest rate derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize interest rate swaps and currency interest rate swaps in economic hedging transactions, including hedges of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets and hedges of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated loans receivable recognized at fair value. Floating interest rates on the swaps are reset on a quarterly basis. Changes in fair value of the debt instruments classified as trading assets and loans receivable recognized at fair value are generally offset by changes in fair value of the related derivatives, both of which are recorded in interest and other, net. ##TABLE_END Equity Market Risk Our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities at the inception of the investment. Before we enter into hedge arrangements, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors, as well as the expected timing of disposal to determine whether hedging is appropriate. Our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives. We recognize changes in the fair value of such derivatives in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. We also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains and losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses and gains on the related liabilities , both of which are recorded in cost of sales and operating expenses. Deferred compensation liabilities were $1.1 billion as of December 28, 2013 ( $859 million as of December 29, 2012 ), and are included in other accrued liabilities. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In 2010, we sold our ownership interest in Numonyx B.V. to Micron for consideration consisting of shares of Micron. We also entered into equity option transactions that economically hedged a portion of the ownership interest in Micron that we acquired. In the second quarter of 2011, we sold our remaining ownership interest in Micron and the related equity options matured. Commodity Price Risk We operate facilities that consume commodities and have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices, such as those for natural gas. These programs reduce, but do not always eliminate, the impact of commodity price movements. Our commodity price risk management program includes commodity derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize commodity swap contracts to hedge future cash flow exposures to the variability in commodity prices. These instruments generally mature within 12 months. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain (loss) from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction.

INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The effects of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of income for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  Location of Gains (Losses) Recognized in Income on Derivatives    Currency forwards  Interest and other, net  $  $  $ Currency interest rate swaps  Interest and other, net   (71 )  (17 ) Equity options  Gains (losses) on equity investments, net   (1 )  (67 ) Interest rate swaps  Interest and other, net     (26 ) Total return swaps  Various    (13 ) Other  Gains (losses) on equity investments, net   (7 )  Other  Interest and other, net      Total  $  $  $ (61 ) ##TABLE_ENDNote 7: Concentrations of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, derivative financial instruments, loans receivable, and trade receivables. When possible, we enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. For presentation on our consolidated balance sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterpartys relative credit standing. Most of our investments in debt instruments are in A/A2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated AA-/Aa3 or better . Our investment policy requires substantially all investments with original maturities at the time of investment of up to six months to be rated at least A-2/P-2 by Standard  Poors/Moodys, and specifies a higher minimum rating for investments with longer maturities. For instance, investments with maturities of greater than three years generally require a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3 at the time of investment. Government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, or the absence of A rated counterparties in certain countries, result in some minor exceptions. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterpartys obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of December 28, 2013 , our total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding Japan government bonds, did not exceed $750 million . We obtain and secure available collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions, when we deem it appropriate. A substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers. We also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and retail distributors. Our three largest customers accounted for 44% of net revenue for 2013 ( 43% for 2012 and 2011 ). Additionally, these three largest customers accounted for 34% of our accounts receivable as of December 28, 2013 ( 33% as of December 29, 2012 ). We believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe that credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis, and from this analysis, we establish credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee or standby letter of credit, or obtaining credit insurance. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 8: Acquisitions  2013 Acquisitions During 2013, we completed 12 acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate net cash consideration of $925 million . Most of the consideration was allocated to goodwill and acquisition-related developed technology intangible assets. Included in these acquisitions is our acquisition of Stonesoft Oyj (Stonesoft) to expand our network security solutions, specifically addressing next generation firewall products. We acquired Stonesoft in the third quarter of 2013 for net cash consideration of $381 million , substantially all of which was allocated to goodwill and acquisition-related developed technology intangible assets. Stonesoft's operating results are included in our software and services operating segments. For information on the assignment of goodwill to our operating segments for our acquisitions, see  Note 10: Goodwill , and for information on the classification of intangible assets, see  Note 11: Identified Intangible Assets . The completed acquisitions in 2013, both individually and in the aggregate, were not significant to our consolidated results of operations. 2012 Acquisitions During 2012, we completed 15 acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate net cash consideration of $638 million . Substantially all of the consideration was allocated to goodwill and acquisition-related developed technology intangible assets. The completed acquisitions in 2012, both individually and in the aggregate, were not significant to our consolidated results of operations. 2011 Acquisitions McAfee, Inc. On February 28, 2011 , we completed the acquisition of McAfee by acquiring all issued and outstanding common shares in exchange for cash. The acquired company continues to operate as McAfee and offers products for endpoint security, network and content security, risk and compliance, and consumer and mobile security. In addition to managing the existing McAfee business, the objective of the acquisition was to accelerate and enhance Intels combination of hardware and software security solutions, thereby improving the overall security of our platforms. Total consideration to acquire McAfee was $6.7 billion (net of $943 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired) and comprised the following: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)   Cash $ 6,652 Share-based awards assumed Total $ 6,700 ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major class in the acquisition of McAfee was recognized as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)   Marketable debt securities $ Goodwill 4,299 Identified intangible assets 3,552 Deferred tax assets Other assets Deferred income (1,049 ) Deferred tax liabilities (1,191 ) Other liabilities (395 ) Total $ 6,700 ##TABLE_ENDINTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The goodwill of $4.3 billion arising from the acquisition is primarily attributed to synergies to enable a single company to combine security and hardware for the protection of online devices, as well as the assembled workforce of McAfee. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is not deductible for tax purposes. For information on the assignment of goodwill to our operating segments for the acquisition, see  Note 10: Goodwill . The identified intangible assets assumed in the acquisition of McAfee were recognized as follows based upon their fair value as of February 28, 2011: ##TABLE_START    Fair Value (In Millions)  Estimated Useful Life (In Years) Developed technology  $ 1,221  Customer relationships  1,418   Total identified intangible assets subject to amortization  $ 2,639     In-process research and development      Trade names      Total identified intangible assets  $ 3,552     ##TABLE_ENDAcquired developed technology represents the fair value of McAfee products that have reached technological feasibility and were part of McAfees product offerings at the date of acquisition. Customer relationships represent the fair value of the underlying relationships and agreements with McAfees customers. In-process RD represents the fair value of incomplete McAfee RD projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition. Incremental costs incurred for those projects are expensed as incurred in RD. Since the acquisition was completed, most of the projects have been completed and the associated costs are being amortized. Trade names are indefinite-lived intangible assets and represent the fair value of brand and name recognition associated with the marketing of McAfees products and services. Other 2011 Acquisitions During 2011, in addition to the McAfee acquisition, we completed 13 acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for total consideration of $2.1 billion , substantially all cash consideration. Total net cash consideration to acquire the Wireless Solutions (WLS) business of Infineon Technologies AG, which operated as Intel Mobile Communications (IMC), was $1.4 billion . The WLS business offers mobile phone components such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers, and power management integrated circuits. In addition to managing the existing WLS business, the objective of the acquisition was to provide solutions that enable wireless connectivity for a broad range of computing applications. In 2013, we completed a reorganization of IMC into our Multi-Comm and existing Phone Group operating segments, see \" Note 27: Operating Segments and Geographic Information .\" The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major class in the acquisitions completed during 2011, excluding McAfee, was allocated as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)   Fair value of net tangible assets acquired $ Goodwill Identified intangible assets 1,409 Total $ 2,132 ##TABLE_ENDFor information on the assignment of goodwill to our operating segments for the acquisitions, see  Note 10: Goodwill .

Since the acquisitions were completed, most of the projects have been completed and the associated costs are being amortized. Actual and Pro Forma Results of Acquirees Net revenue and net income attributable to acquisitions completed during 2011 have been included in our consolidated statements of income from their respective acquisition dates. The acquisitions completed during 2011 were not individually significant to our consolidated results of operations; however, they were significant in the aggregate. During 2011, the results of the businesses acquired in 2011 contributed approximately $3.6 billion to our net revenue and reduced our net income by approximately $275 million ; substantially all of these impacts were attributable to McAfee and the former IMC and include the impacts of the amortization of acquired identified intangible assets. McAfee is a non-reportable operating segment and is aggregated with similar non-reportable operating segments within the software and services operating segments category for segment reporting purposes. IMC has been reorganized into our Multi-Comm and existing Phone Group operating segments which are non-reportable operating segments and are aggregated with similar non-reportable operating segments within the other Intel architecture (Other IA) operating segments category for segment reporting purposes.

Goodwill related to the former IMC was allocated between Multi-Comm and the Phone Group within the Other IA operating segments. Also in 2013, we completed a reorganization that transferred a portion of our wired connectivity business formerly included within the Data Center Group (DCG) to the PC Client Group (PCCG). Due to this reorganization, goodwill was transferred from DCG to PCCG. In 2012, we reorganized and allocated goodwill from the Netbook and Tablet Group into three operating segments: Netbook Group, Tablet Group, and Service Provider Group. These three new operating segments are still included in the Other IA operating segments. Additionally, the former Ultra-Mobility Group is now the Phone Group. For further information on these reorganizations, see  Note 27: Operating Segments and Geographic Information . During the fourth quarters of 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , we completed our annual impairment assessments and we concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years. The accumulated impairment losses as of December 28, 2013 , were $719 million : $346 million associated with PCCG, $275 million associated with DCG, and $ 98 million associated with Other IA operating segments.

Additionally, we recorded other intangible assets subject to amortization of $238 million associated with customer relationships, which was fully amortized in 2013. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In January 2011, we entered into a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA. Under the agreement, we received a license to all of NVIDIAs patents with a capture period that runs through March 2017 while NVIDIA products are licensed to our patents, subject to exclusions for x86 products, certain chipsets, and certain flash memory technology products. The agreement also included settlement of the existing litigation between the companies, as well as broad mutual general releases. We agreed to make payments totaling $1.5 billion to NVIDIA over six years ( $300 million in each of January 2011, 2012, and 2013; and $200 million in each of January 2014, 2015, and 2016), which resulted in a liability totaling approximately $1.4 billion , on a discounted basis. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we recognized an expense of $100 million related to the litigation settlement. In the first quarter of 2011, we recognized the remaining amount of $1.3 billion as licensed technology, which will be amortized into cost of sales over its estimated useful life of 17 years. The initial recognition of the intangible asset and associated liability for future payments to NVIDIA was treated as a non-cash transaction and, therefore, had no impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Future payments are treated as cash used for financing activities. As of December 28, 2013 , the remaining liability of $587 million is classified within other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, based on the expected timing of the underlying payments. We recorded amortization expense on the consolidated statements of income as follows: amortization of acquisition-related developed technology and licensed technology and patents is included in cost of sales, amortization of acquisition-related customer relationships and trade names is included in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and amortization of other intangible assets is recorded as a reduction of revenue.

INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 15: Chipset Design Issue  In January 2011, as part of our ongoing quality assurance procedures, we identified a design issue with the Intel  6 Series Express Chipset family. The issue affected chipsets sold in the fourth quarter of 2010 and January 2011. We subsequently implemented a silicon fix and began shipping the updated version of the affected chipset in February 2011. The total cost in 2011 to repair and replace affected materials and systems, located with customers and in the market, was $ 422 million . We do not expect to have any significant future adjustments related to this issue.

We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion , including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2013 were $300 million ( $500 million during 2012 ). Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard  Poors and P-1 by Moodys as of December 28, 2013 . Long-Term Debt Our long-term debt at the end of each period was as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 29, 2012 2012 Senior notes due 2017 at 1.35%  $ 2,997  $ 2,997 2012 Senior notes due 2022 at 2.70%  1,494  1,494 2012 Senior notes due 2032 at 4.00%   2012 Senior notes due 2042 at 4.25%   2011 Senior notes due 2016 at 1.95%  1,499  1,498 2011 Senior notes due 2021 at 3.30%  1,996  1,996 2011 Senior notes due 2041 at 4.80%  1,490  1,489 2009 Junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2039 at 3.25%  1,075  1,063 2005 Junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2035 at 2.95%   Total long-term debt  $ 13,165  $ 13,136 ##TABLE_ENDSenior Notes In the fourth quarter of 2012, we issued $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes for general corporate purposes and to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock repurchase program. In the third quarter of 2011, we issued $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, primarily to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock repurchase program, and for general corporate purposes. Our senior notes pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually. We may redeem our senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time at our option at specified redemption prices. The senior notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and will effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Convertible Debentures In 2009, we issued $2.0 billion of junior subordinated convertible debentures (the 2009 debentures). In 2005, we issued $1.6 billion of junior subordinated convertible debentures (the 2005 debentures). Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually. ##TABLE_START    Debentures  Debentures Annual coupon interest rate  3.25 %  2.95 % Annual effective interest rate  7.20 %  6.45 % Maximum amount of contingent interest that will accrue per year  0.50 %  0.40 % ##TABLE_ENDThe effective interest rate is based on the rate for a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature. Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures have a contingent interest component that requires us to pay interest based on certain thresholds or for certain events, commencing on August 1, 2019 for the 2009 debentures. As of December 28, 2013 , we have not met any of the thresholds or events related to the 2005 debentures. The fair values of the related embedded derivatives were $10 million and $9 million as of December 28, 2013 , for the 2009 and 2005 debentures, respectively ( $6 million and zero as of December 29, 2012 for the 2009 and 2005 debentures, respectively). Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into shares of our common stock. Holders can surrender the 2009 debentures for conversion if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter. Holders can surrender the 2005 debentures for conversion at any time. We will settle any conversion or repurchase of the 2009 debentures in cash up to the face value, and any amount in excess of face value will be settled in cash or stock at our option. However, we can settle any conversion or repurchase of the 2005 debentures in cash or stock at our option. On or after August 5, 2019, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2009 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the date on which we provide notice of redemption. We can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2005 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the date on which we provide notice of redemption. If certain events occur in the future, the indentures governing the 2009 and 2005 debentures provide that each holder of the debentures can, for a pre-defined period of time, require us to repurchase the holders debentures for the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures are subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior debt and to the other liabilities of our subsidiaries. We have concluded that both the 2009 and 2005 debentures are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded stock conversion options qualify as derivatives. In addition, we have concluded that the embedded conversion options would be classified in stockholders equity if they were freestanding derivative instruments. As such, the embedded conversion options are not accounted for separately as derivatives.  ##TABLE_START    2009 Debentures  2005 Debentures (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 29, 2012  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 29, 2012 Outstanding principal  $ 2,000  $ 2,000  $ 1,600  $ 1,600 Equity component carrying amount  $  $  $  $ Unamortized discount  $  $  $  $ Net debt carrying amount  $ 1,075  $ 1,063  $  $ Conversion rate (shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures)  45.57  45.05  34.60  33.86 Effective conversion price (per share of common stock)  $ 21.94  $ 22.20  $ 28.90  $ 29.53 ##TABLE_ENDIn the preceding table, the remaining amortization periods for the unamortized discounts for the 2009 and 2005 debentures are approximately 26 and 22 years, respectively, as of December 28, 2013 . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The conversion rate adjusts for certain events outlined in the indentures governing the 2009 and 2005 debentures, such as quarterly dividend distributions in excess of $0.14 and $0.10 per share for the 2009 and 2005 debentures, respectively, but it does not adjust for accrued interest. In addition, the conversion rate will increase for a holder of either the 2009 or 2005 debentures who elects to convert the debentures in connection with certain share exchanges, mergers, or consolidations involving Intel. Arizona Bonds In 2007, we guaranteed repayment of principal and interest on bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona, which constituted an unsecured general obligation for Intel. The aggregate principal amount of the bonds issued in December 2007 was $125 million . The 2007 Arizona bonds were tendered and repaid in December 2012. These bonds bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.3% . In the future, we may re-market the bonds as either fixed-rate bonds for a specified period or as variable-rate bonds until their final maturity on December 1, 2037 . Debt Maturities Our aggregate debt maturities based on outstanding principal as of December 28, 2013 , by year payable, were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)    $     1,500  3,000   2019 and thereafter  10,275 Total  $ 14,775 ##TABLE_ENDSubstantially all of the difference between the total aggregate debt maturities in the preceding table and the total carrying amount of our debt is due to the unamortized discount of our convertible debentures. Note 17: Retirement Benefit Plans  Retirement Contribution Plans We provide tax-qualified retirement contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. and certain other countries. The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees hired prior to January 1, 2011 are eligible for and receive discretionary employer contributions in the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan, while employees hired on or after January 1, 2011 receive discretionary employer contributions in the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan. Our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) determines the annual discretionary employer contribution amounts for the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan and the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan under delegation of authority from our Board of Directors, pursuant to the terms of the plans. As of December 28, 2013 , 83% of our U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan assets were invested in equities, and 17% were invested in fixed-income instruments. These assets are managed by external investment managers. The discretionary employer contributions made to the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan are participant-directed. For the benefit of eligible U.S. employees, we also provide a non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees. This plan is designed to permit certain discretionary employer contributions and to permit employee deferral of a portion of compensation in addition to their Intel 401(k) Savings Plan deferrals. This plan is unfunded. We expensed $298 million for the qualified and non-qualified U.S. retirement contribution plans in 2013 ( $357 million in 2012 and $340 million in 2011 ). In the first quarter of 2014 , we funded $288 million for the 2013 contributions to the qualified U.S. retirement contribution plans. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans U.S. Pension Benefits. For employees hired prior to January 1, 2011, we provide a tax-qualified defined-benefit pension plan, the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan, for eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. The U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan benefit is determined by a participants years of service and final average compensation as defined by the plan document. The plan generates a minimum pension benefit if the participants U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan benefit exceeds the annuitized value of their U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan benefit. If participant balances in the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan do not grow sufficiently, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan could increase significantly. Consistent with applicable law, assets of the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan are held in trust, solely for the benefit of plan participants, and are not available for general corporate purposes. Non-U.S. Pension Benefits. We also provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain other countries, most significantly Ireland, Israel, Germany and Japan. Consistent with the requirements of local law, we deposit funds for certain plans with insurance companies, with third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts, and/or accrue for the unfunded portion of the obligation. Effective June 20, 2012, Ireland closed its pension plan to employees hired on or after this date. U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits. Upon retirement, eligible U.S. employees who were hired prior to January 1, 2014, are credited with a defined dollar amount, based on years of service, into a U.S. Sheltered Employee Retirement Medical Account (SERMA). These credits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase coverage in the retirees choice of medical plan. If the available credits are not sufficient to pay the entire cost of the coverage, the remaining cost is the retirees responsibility. Effective January 1, 2014, employees hired on or after January 1, 2014, are not eligible to earn a SERMA benefit. Funding Policy. Our practice is to fund the various pension plans and the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of applicable local laws and regulations. Additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate. Depending on the design of the plan, local customs, and market circumstances, the liabilities of a plan may exceed qualified plan assets.

Included in the aggregate data in the following tables are the amounts applicable to our pension plans, with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, as well as plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. Amounts related to such plans at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START    U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits (In Millions)  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 29, 2012  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 29, 2012 Plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:         Accumulated benefit obligations  $   $   $  $ Plan assets  $   $   $  $ Plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:         Projected benefit obligations  $ 1,137  $ 1,742  $ 1,295  $ 1,400 Plan assets  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDOn a worldwide basis, our pension and postretirement benefit plans were 61% funded as of December 28, 2013 . The U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan, which accounts for approximately 34% of the worldwide pension and postretirement benefit obligations, was 57% funded. Funded status is not indicative of our ability to pay ongoing pension benefits or of our obligation to fund retirement trusts. Required pension funding for U.S. retirement plans is determined in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) which sets required minimum contributions. Cumulative company funding to the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan currently exceeds the minimum ERISA funding requirements. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Assumptions Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START    U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits    Dec 28, 2013  Dec 29, 2012  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 29, 2012  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 29, 2012 Discount rate  4.8 %  3.9 %  4.0 %  4.2 %  4.6 %  3.6 % Rate of compensation increase  3.8 %  4.1 %  3.9 %  4.0 %  n/a  n/a ##TABLE_ENDWeighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine costs for the plans for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START    U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits            Discount rate  3.9 %  4.7 %  5.8 %  4.2 %  5.0 %  5.3 %  4.2 %  4.6 %  5.6 % Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  4.5 %  5.0 %  5.5 %  5.2 %  5.9 %  6.3 %  7.7 %  3.0 %  3.0 % Rate of compensation increase  4.1 %  4.5 %  4.7 %  4.3 %  4.1 %  4.3 %  n/a  n/a  n/a ##TABLE_ENDFor the U.S. plans, we developed the discount rate by calculating the benefit payment streams by year to determine when benefit payments will be due. We then matched the benefit payment streams by year to the AA corporate bond rates to match the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments and discounted back to the measurement date to determine the appropriate discount rate. For the non-U.S. plans, we used two approaches to develop the discount rate. In certain countries, we used a model consisting of a theoretical bond portfolio for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximated the estimated benefit payments of our pension plans. In other countries, we analyzed current market long-term bond rates and matched the bond maturity with the average duration of the pension liabilities. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions takes into consideration both duration and risk of the investment portfolios, and is developed through consensus and building-block methodologies. The consensus methodology includes unadjusted estimates by the fund manager on future market expectations by broad asset classes and geography. The building-block approach determines the rates of return implied by historical risk premiums across asset classes. In addition, we analyze rates of return relevant to the country where each plan is in effect and the investments applicable to the plan, expectations of future returns, local actuarial projections, and the projected long-term rates of return from external investment managers. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets shown for the non-U.S. plan assets is weighted to reflect each countrys relative portion of the non-U.S. plan assets. Net Periodic Benefit Cost In 2013 , the net periodic benefit cost for U.S. pension benefits, non-U.S. pension benefits, and U.S. postretirement medical benefits was $230 million ( $210 million in 2012 and $88 million in 2011 ), $116 million ( $88 million in 2012 and $80 million in 2011 ) and $77 million ( $50 million in 2012 and $39 million in 2011 ), respectively. The increase in the U.S. and non-U.S. pension benefit costs is primarily attributed to an increase in service costs compared to 2012. The increase in the U.S. postretirement medical benefits compared to 2012 is primarily attributed to special one-time termination benefit costs incurred in 2013. U.S. Pension Plan Assets In general, the investment strategy for U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets is to maximize risk-adjusted returns, taking into consideration the investment horizon and expected volatility, to ensure that there are sufficient assets available to pay pension benefits as they come due. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 60% for fixed-income debt instrument investments and 40% for equity investments in 2013 . The expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets is 5.2% . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following investment categories at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START    December 28, 2013  Dec 29, 2012    Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using     (In Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total  Total Equity securities  $  $  $   $  $ Fixed income      Other investments         Total assets measured at fair value  $  $  $  $  $ Cash         Total U.S. pension plan assets at fair value        $  $ ##TABLE_ENDA substantial majority of the fixed income investments in the preceding table are corporate bonds, government bonds, and asset-backed securities. Corporate bonds include both U.S. and non-U.S. bonds with the majority held in high-quality bonds. Government bonds include bonds issued or deemed to be guaranteed by government entities and include instruments such as non-U.S. government bonds, U.S. Treasury securities, and U.S. agency securities. The Level 3 investments relate to our asset-backed securities, as we used unobservable inputs to the valuations that were significant to the fair value measurements. Non-U.S. Plan Assets The investments of the non-U.S. plans are managed by insurance companies, third-party trustees, or pension funds, consistent with regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. The investment manager evaluates performance by comparing the actual rate of return to the return on similar assets. Investments managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under standard contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we have discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equities and fixed-income debt instruments, either through index funds or direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market risk and to assure that the pension assets are available to pay benefits as they come due. The target allocation of the non-U.S. plan assets that we have control over is 80% equity securities and 20% fixed-income instruments. The average expected long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plan assets is 5.7% . Non-U.S. plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following investment categories at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START    December 28, 2013  Dec 29, 2012    Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using     (In Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total  Total Equity securities  $  $  $  $  $ Fixed income       Total assets measured at fair value  $  $  $  $  $ Cash         Total non-U.S. plan assets at fair value        $ 1,005  $ ##TABLE_ENDSubstantially all of the equity securities in the preceding table are invested in a diversified mix of equities of developed countries, including the U.S., and emerging markets throughout the world. The majority of the fixed income securities in the preceding table are investments held by insurance companies and insurance contracts that are managed by qualified insurance companies. We do not have control over the target allocation or visibility of the investment strategies of those investments. Insurance contracts and investments held by insurance companies made up 38% of total non-U.S. plan assets as of December 28, 2013 ( 40% as of December 29, 2012 ). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) U.S. Postretirement Medical Plan Assets In general, the investment strategy for U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets due to the level of expected future benefit payments. In 2012, we modified the investment strategy for plan assets from investing solely in a money market account to investing in a tax-aware global equity portfolio, which is actively managed by an external investment manager. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is comprised of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries, including the U.S., and emerging markets throughout the world. The expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets is 7.4% . As of December 28, 2013 , substantially all of the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets were invested in exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. Concentrations of Risk We manage a variety of risks, including market, credit, and liquidity risks, across our plan assets through our investment managers. We define a concentration of risk as an undiversified exposure to one of the aforementioned risks that unnecessarily increases the exposure to a loss of plan assets. We monitor exposure to such risks in both the U.S. and non-U.S. plans by monitoring the magnitude of the risk in each plan and diversifying our exposure to such risks across a variety of instruments, markets, and counterparties. As of December 28, 2013 , we did not have concentrations of risk in any single entity, manager, counterparty, sector, industry, or country. Funding Expectations Under applicable law for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan and the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan, we are not required to make any contributions during 2014 . Our expected required funding for the non-U.S. plans during 2014 is approximately $62 million . Estimated Future Benefit Payments Estimated benefit payments over the next 10 fiscal years are as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits  $  $  $ 2015  $  $  $ 2016  $  $  $ 2017  $  $  $ 2018  $  $  $ 2019-2023  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDNote 18: Commitments  A portion of our capital equipment and certain facilities are under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2028 . Additionally, portions of our real property are under leases that expire at various dates through 2062 . Rental expense was $270 million in 2013 ( $214 million in 2012 and $178 million in 2011 ). Minimum rental commitments under all non-cancelable leases with an initial term in excess of one year were as follows as of December 28, 2013 : ##TABLE_START (In Millions)     $ 2015  2016  2017  2018  2019 and thereafter  Total  $ ##TABLE_ENDINTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Commitments for construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment totaled $5.5 billion as of December 28, 2013 ( $4.6 billion as of December 29, 2012 ), substantially all of which will be due within the next year. Other purchase obligations and commitments totaled approximately $1.9 billion as of December 28, 2013 (approximately $2.0 billion as of December 29, 2012 ). Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include agreements to fund various projects with other companies. In addition, we have various contractual commitments with Micron and IMFT. For further information on these contractual commitments, see  Note 5: Cash and Investments . During 2012, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML intended to accelerate the development of 450mm wafer technology and extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) . Intel agreed to provide RD funding totaling 829 million over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from ASML. Our remaining obligation, contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, is approximately 738 million , or $1.0 billion , as of December 28, 2013 . As our obligation is contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, we have not included this obligation in the preceding other purchase obligations and commitments total. Note 19: Employee Equity Incentive Plans  Our equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. In May 2013 , stockholders approved an extension of the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan). Stockholders approved 123 million additional shares for issuance, increasing the total shares of common stock authorized for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors to 719 million shares. The approval also extended the expiration date of the 2006 Plan to June 2016. A maximum of 517 million of these shares can be awarded as non-vested shares (restricted stock) or non-vested share units (restricted stock units). As of December 28, 2013 , 304 million shares remained available for future grant under the 2006 Plan. Going forward, we may assume the equity incentive plans and the outstanding equity awards of certain acquired companies. Once they are assumed, we do not grant additional shares under those plans. In connection with our completed acquisition of McAfee in 2011, we assumed McAfees equity incentive plan and issued replacement awards. The stock options and restricted stock units issued generally retain similar terms and conditions of the respective plan under which they were originally granted. We issue restricted stock units with both a market condition and a service condition (market-based restricted stock units), referred to in our 2013 Proxy Statement as outperformance stock units, to a small group of senior officers and non-employee directors. For market-based restricted stock units issued in 2013 , the number of shares of Intel common stock to be received at vesting will range from 50% to 200% of the target amount, based on total stockholder return (TSR) on Intel common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of a peer group over a three-year period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. As of December 28, 2013 , 3 million market-based restricted stock units were outstanding. These market-based restricted stock units accrue dividend equivalents and generally vest three years and one month from the grant date. Equity awards granted to employees in 2013 under our equity incentive plans generally vest over four years from the date of grant, and options expire seven years from the date of grant, with the exception of market-based restricted stock units, a small number of restricted stock units granted to executive-level employees, and replacement awards related to acquisitions. The 2006 Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific dates. In May 2011, stockholders approved an extension of the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan. Stockholders approved 133 million additional shares for issuance, increasing the total shares of common stock available for issuance to 373 million shares. The approval also extended the expiration date of the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan to August 2016. As of December 28, 2013 , 216 million shares were available for issuance under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation recognized in 2013 was $1.1 billion ( $1.1 billion in 2012 and $1.1 billion in 2011 ). On a quarterly basis, we assess changes to our estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on our review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. We recognize the effect of adjustments made to the forfeiture rates, if any, in the period that we change the forfeiture estimate. The effect of forfeiture adjustments in 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 was not significant. The total share-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory as of December 28, 2013 , was $38 million ( $41 million as of December 29, 2012 and $38 million as of December 31, 2011 ). During 2013 , the tax benefit that we realized for the tax deduction from share-based awards totaled $385 million ( $510 million in 2012 and $327 million in 2011 ). We estimate the fair value of restricted stock unit awards with time-based vesting using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting. We estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock units using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant. We based the weighted average estimated value of restricted stock unit grants, as well as the weighted average assumptions that we used in calculating the fair value, on estimates at the date of grant, for each period as follows: ##TABLE_START      Estimated values  $ 21.45  $ 25.32  $ 19.86 Risk-free interest rate  0.2 %  0.3 %  0.7 % Dividend yield  3.8 %  3.3 %  3.4 % Volatility  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted under our equity incentive plans and rights to acquire stock granted under our stock purchase plan. We based the weighted average estimated value of employee stock option grants and rights granted under the stock purchase plan, as well as the weighted average assumptions used in calculating the fair value, on estimates at the date of grant, for each period as follows: ##TABLE_START    Stock Options  Stock Purchase Plan         Estimated values  $ 3.11  $ 4.22  $ 3.91  $ 4.52  $ 5.47  $ 4.69 Expected life (in years)  5.2  5.3  5.4  0.5  0.5  0.5 Risk-free interest rate  0.8 %  1.0 %  2.2 %  0.1 %  0.1 %  0.2 % Dividend yield  3.9 %  3.3 %  3.4 %  4.0 %  3.3 %  3.6 % Volatility  %  %  %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDWe base the expected volatility on implied volatility because we have determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. Prior to 2011, we used the simplified method of calculating expected life due to significant differences in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to our historical grants. In 2011, we began using historical option exercise data as the basis for determining expected life, as we believe that we have sufficient historical data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected life input for valuing options using the Black-Scholes model.

The grant-date fair value of awards that vested in 2013 was $899 million ( $816 million in 2012 and $697 million in 2011 ). The number of restricted stock units vested includes shares that we withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. Restricted stock units that are expected to vest are net of estimated future forfeitures. As of December 28, 2013 , there was $1.6 billion in unrecognized compensation costs related to restricted stock units granted under our equity incentive plans. We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of 1.2 years .

INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Stock Purchase Plan Approximately 76% of our employees were participating in our 2006 Stock Purchase Plan as of December 28, 2013 ( 72% in 2012 and 70% in 2011 ). Employees purchased 20.5 million shares in 2013 for $369 million under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan ( 17.4 million shares for $355 million in 2012 and 18.5 million shares for $318 million in 2011 ). As of December 28, 2013 , there was $13 million in unrecognized compensation costs related to rights to acquire common stock under our stock purchase plan. We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately one and a half months. Note 20: Common Stock Repurchases  Common Stock Repurchase Program We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in October 2005, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to $45 billion in shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. As of December 28, 2013 , $3.2 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit. During 2013 , we repurchased 94.1 million shares of common stock at a cost of $2.1 billion ( 191.0 million shares of common stock at a cost of $4.8 billion in 2012 and 642.3 million shares of common stock at a cost of $14.1 billion in 2011 ). We have repurchased 4.4 billion shares at a cost of $91 billion since the program began in 1990. Restricted Stock Unit Withholdings We issue restricted stock units as part of our equity incentive plans. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. In our consolidated financial statements, we also treat shares withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase plan . During 2013 , we withheld 13.1 million shares to satisfy $293 million of employees tax obligations ( 12.6 million shares to satisfy $345 million during 2012 and 10.3 million shares to satisfy $207 million during 2011 ).

For further information, see  Note 5: Cash and Investments . Note 23: Earnings Per Share  We computed our basic and diluted earnings per common share for each period as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)    Net income available to common stockholders  $ 9,620  $ 11,005  $ 12,942 Weighted average common shares outstandingbasic  4,970  4,996  5,256 Dilutive effect of employee equity incentive plans    Dilutive effect of convertible debt    Weighted average common shares outstandingdiluted  5,097  5,160  5,411 Basic earnings per common share  $ 1.94  $ 2.20  $ 2.46 Diluted earnings per common share  $ 1.89  $ 2.13  $ 2.39 ##TABLE_ENDWe computed basic earnings per common share using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We computed diluted earnings per common share using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Net income available to participating securities was insignificant for all periods presented. Potentially dilutive common shares from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan. Potentially dilutive common shares are determined by applying the if-converted method for our 2005 debentures. However, as our 2009 debentures require settlement of the principal amount of the debt in cash upon conversion, with the conversion premium paid in cash or stock at our option, potentially dilutive common shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method. For further discussion on the specific conversion features of our 2005 and 2009 debentures, see  Note 16: Borrowings . In 2013 , we excluded on average 55 million outstanding stock options and restricted stock units ( 29 million in 2012 and 90 million in 2011 ) from the computation of diluted earnings per common share because these would have been antidilutive. These options could potentially be included in the dilutive earnings per common share calculation in the future if the average market value of the common shares increases and is greater than the exercise price of these options. In 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , we included our 2009 debentures in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the average market price was above the conversion price. We could potentially exclude the 2009 debentures again in the future if the average market price is below the conversion price. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 24: Income Taxes  Income Tax Provision Income before taxes and the provision for taxes consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)    Income before taxes:       U.S.  $ 9,374  $ 10,042  $ 14,659 Non-U.S.  3,237  4,831  3,122 Total income before taxes  $ 12,611  $ 14,873  $ 17,781 Provision for taxes:       Current:       Federal  $ 2,730  $ 2,539  $ 3,212 State    Non-U.S.   1,135  Total current provision for taxes  $ 3,514  $ 3,726  $ 3,690 Deferred:       Federal  $ (412 )  $  $ 1,175 Other  (111 )   (26 ) Total deferred provision for taxes  $ (523 )  $  $ 1,149 Total provision for taxes  $ 2,991  $ 3,868  $ 4,839 Effective tax rate  23.7 %  26.0 %  27.2 % ##TABLE_ENDThe difference between the tax provision at the statutory federal income tax rate and the tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes (effective tax rate) for each period was as follows: ##TABLE_START      Statutory federal income tax rate  35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % Increase (reduction) in rate resulting from:       Non-U.S. income taxed at different rates  (5.8 )  (7.3 )  (4.4 ) Research and development tax credits  (3.5 )    (1.0 ) Domestic manufacturing deduction benefit  (2.1 )  (2.1 )  (1.9 ) Other  0.1  0.4  (0.5 ) Effective tax rate  23.7 %  26.0 %  27.2 % ##TABLE_ENDThe U.S. RD tax credit was reenacted in January 2013 retroactive to the beginning of 2012. The full year 2012 impact of the U.S. RD tax credit was recognized in the first quarter of 2013. Income in certain non-U.S. countries is fully exempt from income taxes for a limited period of time due to eligible activities and certain capital investment actions. These full tax exemptions expire at various dates through 2020 ; however, the exemptions in certain countries are eligible for renewal. In 2013 , the tax benefit attributable to tax holidays was $213 million ( $252 million for 2012 and $554 million for 2011 ) with a $0.04 impact on diluted earnings per share ( $0.05 for 2012 and $0.10 for 2011 ). During 2013 , net income tax benefits attributable to equity-based compensation transactions that were allocated to stockholders equity totaled $3 million (net benefits of $137 million in 2012 and net deficiencies of $18 million in 2011 ). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Deferred and Current Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 29, 2012 Deferred tax assets:     Accrued compensation and other benefits  $ 1,047  $ 1,125 Share-based compensation   Deferred income   Inventory   Unrealized losses on investments and derivatives    State credits and net operating losses   Other, net   Gross deferred tax assets  4,048  3,893 Valuation allowance  (456 )  (389 ) Total deferred tax assets  $ 3,592  $ 3,504 Deferred tax liabilities:     Property, plant and equipment  $ (2,023 )  $ (2,325 ) Licenses and intangibles  (687 )  (778 ) Convertible debt  (911 )  (856 ) Unrealized gains on investments and derivatives  (815 )   Investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries  (244 )  (213 ) Other, net  (281 )  (269 ) Total deferred tax liabilities  $ (4,961 )  $ (4,441 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)  $ (1,369 )  $ (937 )      Reported as:     Current deferred tax assets  $ 2,594  $ 2,117 Non-current deferred tax assets   Non-current deferred tax liabilities  (4,397 )  (3,412 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)  $ (1,369 )  $ (937 ) ##TABLE_ENDNon-current deferred tax assets are included within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The valuation allowance is based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. The valuation allowance as of December 28, 2013 , included allowances related to unrealized state credit carryforwards of $364 million and matters related to our non-U.S. subsidiaries of $92 million . As of December 28, 2013 , our federal, state, and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $239 million , $353 million , and $647 million , respectively. Approximately half of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The remaining non-U.S. as well as the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2033 . A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. relates to acquisitions and, as a result, is limited in the amount that can be recognized in any one year. The non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards include $342 million that is not likely to be recovered and has been reduced by a valuation allowance. As of December 28, 2013 , we had not recognized U.S. deferred income taxes on a cumulative total of $20.0 billion of undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and $2.4 billion of other basis differences of our investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries primarily related to McAfee. Determining the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to investments in these non-U.S. subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested is not practicable. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest those earnings and other basis differences in operations outside the U.S. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Current income taxes receivable of $65 million as of December 28, 2013 , ( $866 million as of December 29, 2012 ) is included in other current assets. Current income taxes payable of $542 million as of December 28, 2013 , ( $711 million as of December 29, 2012 ) is included in other accrued liabilities. Long-term income taxes payable of $188 million as of December 28, 2013 , ( $177 million as of December 29, 2012 ) within other long-term liabilities, includes uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and non-U.S. tax credits, and may also include other long-term tax liabilities that are not uncertain but have not yet been paid. Uncertain Tax Positions The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)    Beginning gross unrecognized tax benefits  $  $  $ Settlements and effective settlements with tax authorities and related remeasurements  (2 )  (81 )  (63 ) Lapse of statute of limitations    (5 )  (17 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods    Decreases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods  (9 )  (6 )  (21 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during current period    Ending gross unrecognized tax benefits  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDDuring 2013 , we settled and effectively settled matters with certain state and non-U.S. tax authorities relating to tax positions taken during prior periods. The result of the settlements, effective settlements, and re-measurements resulted in an insignificant reduction in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits in 2013 ( $81 million in 2012 and $63 million in 2011 ). The related tax benefit for settlements, effective settlements, and re-measurements is insignificant for 2013 ( $7 million for 2012 and $61 million for 2011 ). If the remaining balance of $207 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 28, 2013 , ( $189 million as of December 29, 2012 ) were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $81 million and a reduction in the effective tax rate ( $66 million as of December 29, 2012 ). During all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of income. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in 2013 ( insignificant in 2012 and $24 million in 2011 ). As of December 28, 2013 , we had $73 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits ( $66 million as of December 29, 2012 ). Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain non-U.S. tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months which could significantly increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. However, the estimated impact to income tax expense and net income is not expected to be significant. We file federal, state, and non-U.S. tax returns. For state and non-U.S. tax returns, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2001 . For federal tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2009 .

The estimated net prior service costs and net actuarial gains (losses) for the defined benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost during 2014 are $4 million and $39 million , respectively. We estimate that we will reclassify approximately $6 million (before taxes) of net derivative losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings within the next 12 months. Note 26: Contingencies  Legal Proceedings We are a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted in this section. Although management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. Were unfavorable outcomes to occur, the possibility exists for a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. However, we have not reached this conclusion with respect to any particular matter at this time. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A number of proceedings generally have challenged and continue to challenge certain of our competitive practices. The allegations in these proceedings vary and are described in more detail in the following paragraphs. In general, they contend that we improperly conditioned price rebates and other discounts on our microprocessors on exclusive or near-exclusive dealing by some of our customers; and they allege that our software compiler business unfairly preferred Intel  microprocessors over competing microprocessors and that, through the use of our compilers and other means, we have caused the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading benchmark results concerning our microprocessors. Based on the procedural posture of the various remaining competition matters, which we describe in subsequent paragraphs, our investment of resources to explain and defend our position has declined as compared to the period 2005-2011. Nonetheless, certain of the matters remain active, and these challenges could continue for a number of years, potentially requiring us to invest additional resources. We believe that we compete lawfully and that our marketing, business, intellectual property, and other challenged practices benefit our customers and our stockholders, and we will continue to conduct a vigorous defense in the remaining proceedings. Government Competition Matters and Related Consumer Class Actions In 2001, the European Commission (EC) commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy our microprocessors. We received numerous requests for information and documents from the EC and we responded to each of those requests. The EC issued a Statement of Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. In May 2009, the EC issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged  conditional rebates and payments  that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged  payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.  The EC imposed a fine in the amount of 1.06 billion ( $1.447 billion as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to  immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in  the EC decision. In the second quarter of 2009, we recorded the related charge within marketing, general and administrative. We strongly disagree with the EC ' s decision, and we appealed the decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The hearing of our appeal took place on July 3 through July 6, 2012. The court ' s decision is expected in 2014. The EC decision exceeds 500 pages but contains no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision states that we should  cease and desist  from further conduct that, in the EC ' s opinion, would violate applicable law. We have taken steps, which are subject to the EC ' s ongoing review, to comply with that decision pending appeal. We had discussions with the EC to better understand the decision and to explain changes to our business practices. Based on our current understanding and expectations, we do not believe that any such changes will be material to our financial position, results, or cash flows. In June  2005, we received an inquiry from the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) requesting documents from our Korean subsidiary related to marketing and rebate programs that we entered into with Korean PC manufacturers. In February 2006, the KFTC initiated an inspection of documents at our offices in Korea. In September 2007, the KFTC served on us an Examination Report alleging that sales to two customers during parts of 2002 - 2005 violated Korea ' s Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act. In December 2007, we submitted our written response to the KFTC. In February 2008, the KFTC ' s examiner submitted a written reply to our response. In March 2008, we submitted a further response. In April 2008, we participated in a pre-hearing conference before the KFTC, and we participated in formal hearings in May and June 2008. In June 2008, the KFTC announced its intent to fine us approximately $25 million for providing discounts to Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and TriGem Computer Inc. In November 2008, the KFTC issued a final written decision concluding that our discounts had violated Korean antitrust law and imposing a fine on us of approximately $20 million , which we paid in January 2009. In December 2008, we appealed this decision by filing a lawsuit in the Seoul High Court seeking to overturn the KFTC ' s decision. In June 2013, the Seoul High Court rejected Intel's appeal and affirmed the KFTC's findings, including the imposition of the fine. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) At least 82 separate class-action lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. District Courts for the Northern District of California, Southern District of California, District of Idaho, District of Nebraska, District of New Mexico, District of Maine, and District of Delaware, as well as in various California, Kansas, and Tennessee state courts. These actions generally repeat the allegations made in a now-settled lawsuit filed against us by AMD in June 2005 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (AMD litigation). Like the AMD litigation, these class-action lawsuits allege that we engaged in various actions in violation of the Sherman Act and other laws by, among other things: providing discounts and rebates to our manufacturer and distributor customers conditioned on exclusive or near-exclusive dealing that allegedly unfairly interfered with AMD ' s ability to sell its microprocessors; interfering with certain AMD product launches; and interfering with AMD ' s participation in certain industry standards-setting groups. The class actions allege various consumer injuries, including that consumers in various states have been injured by paying higher prices for computers containing our microprocessors. We dispute these class-action claims and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. All of the federal class actions and the Kansas and Tennessee state court class actions have been transferred by the Multidistrict Litigation Panel to the U.S. District Court in Delaware for all pre-trial proceedings and discovery (MDL proceedings). The Delaware district court appointed a Special Master to address issues in the MDL proceedings, as assigned by the court. In January 2010, the plaintiffs in the Delaware action filed a motion for sanctions for our alleged failure to preserve evidence. This motion largely copies a motion previously filed by AMD in the AMD litigation, which has settled. The plaintiffs in the MDL proceedings also moved for certification of a class of members who purchased certain PCs containing products sold by us. In July 2010, the Special Master issued a Report and Recommendation (Report) denying the motion to certify a class. The MDL plaintiffs filed objections to the Special Master ' s Report, and a hearing on those objections was held in March 2011. In September 2012, the court ruled that an evidentiary hearing would be necessary to enable the court to rule on the objections to the Special Master ' s Report, to resolve the motion to certify the class, and to resolve a separate motion to exclude certain testimony and evidence from the MDL plaintiffs ' expert. The hearing occurred in July 2013, and we are awaiting the court's decision on the class certification issues. All California class actions have been consolidated in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County. The plaintiffs in the California actions have moved for class certification, which we are in the process of opposing. At our request, the court in the California actions has agreed to delay ruling on this motion until after the Delaware district court rules on the similar motion in the MDL proceedings. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including the fact that the Delaware district court has not determined whether the matters before it may proceed as a class action, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from these matters. In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation  Between May and July 2011, former employees of Intel, Adobe Systems Incorporated, Apple Inc., Google Inc., Intuit Inc., Lucasfilm Ltd., and Pixar filed antitrust class action lawsuits in the California Superior Courts alleging that these companies had entered into a conspiracy to suppress the compensation of their employees. The California Superior Court lawsuits were removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and were consolidated. The plaintiffs  allegations referenced the 2009 and 2010 investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ) into employment practices in the technology industry, as well as the DOJ  s complaints and subsequent stipulated final judgments with the seven companies named as defendants in the lawsuits. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants entered into certain unlawful agreements not to cold call employees of particular other defendants and that there was an overarching conspiracy among the defendants. Plaintiffs assert one such agreement specific to Intel, namely that Intel and Google entered into an agreement starting no later than September 2007, not to cold call each other  s employees. In September 2011, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, captioned In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, which asserts the same state law claims as the state court complaints, and also asserts claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act and Section 4 of the Clayton Antitrust Act. Plaintiffs  consolidated amended complaint seeks a declaration that the defendants  alleged actions violated the antitrust laws; damages, trebled as provided for by law under the Sherman Act or Clayton Act; restitution, and disgorgement; and attorneys  fees and costs. In April 2012, the court granted the defendants  motion to dismiss plaintiffs  state law claims but denied defendants  motion to dismiss the Sherman Act and Clayton Act claims. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In October 2013, the court certified a class consisting of approximately 66,000 current or former employees of the seven defendants. This so-called  technical class  consists of a group of current and former technical, creative, and RD employees at each of the defendants. In January 2014, Intel filed a motion for summary judgment which is scheduled for hearing in March 2014. Trial is scheduled to begin in late May 2014. Given the procedural posture and the nature of this case, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from this matter. We dispute the plaintiffs  claims and intend to defend the lawsuit vigorously. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. v. Intel In May 2013, Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. (LOTC) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LBHI) filed an adversary complaint in the United States Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York asserting claims against us arising from a 2008 contract between Intel and LOTC. Under the terms of the 2008 contract, we prepaid $1.0 billion to LOTC, in exchange for which LOTC was required to deliver to us on or before September 29, 2008, quantities of Intel common stock and cash determined by a formula set forth in the contract. LOTC's performance under the contract was secured by $1.0 billion of cash collateral. Under the terms of the contract, LOTC was obligated to deliver approximately 50 million shares of our common stock to us on September 29, 2008. LOTC failed to deliver any Intel common stock or cash, and we exercised our right of set-off against the $1.0 billion collateral. LOTC and LBHI acknowledge in their complaint that we were entitled to set off our losses against the collateral, but they assert that we withheld collateral in excess of our losses that should have been returned to LOTC. The complaint asserts a claim for breach of contract, a claim for turnover under section 542(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, and a claim for violation of the automatic stay under section 362(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code. The complaint does not expressly quantify the amount of damages claimed but does assert multiple theories of damages that impliedly seek up to $312 million of alleged excess collateral, plus interest based on LOTC's claimed cost of borrowing. In June 2013, we filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs' bankruptcy claims and for a determination that the breach of contract claim is non-core under the Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy court granted our motion in its entirety in December 2013. In January 2014, based on the bankruptcy courts ruling, we filed a motion in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York requesting that the district court withdraw its reference to the bankruptcy court of plaintiffs adversary complaint. Given the procedural posture and the nature of this case, including that discovery has just begun, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from this matter. We believe that we acted in a manner consistent with our contractual rights, and we intend to defend against any claim to the contrary. McAfee, Inc. Shareholder Litigation On August 19, 2010, we announced that we had agreed to acquire all of McAfees common stock for $48.00 per share. Four McAfee shareholders filed putative class-action lawsuits in Santa Clara County, California Superior Court challenging the proposed transaction. The cases were ordered consolidated in September 2010. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that named former McAfee board members, McAfee and Intel as defendants, and alleged that the McAfee board members breached their fiduciary duties and that McAfee and Intel aided and abetted those breaches of duty. The complaint requested rescission of the merger agreement, such other equitable relief as the court may deem proper, and an award of damages in an unspecified amount. In June 2012, the plaintiffs damages expert asserted that the value of a McAfee share for the purposes of assessing damages should be $62.08 . In January 2012, the court certified the action as a class action, appointed the Central Pension Laborers Fund to act as the class representative, and scheduled trial to begin in January 2013. In March 2012, defendants filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse the class certification order; the petition was denied in June 2012. In March 2012, at defendants request, the court held that plaintiffs were not entitled to a jury trial, and ordered a bench trial. In April 2012, plaintiffs filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse that order, which the court of appeal denied in July 2012. In August 2012, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted that motion in November 2012, and entered final judgment in the case in February 2013. In April 2013, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. Because the resolution of the appeal may materially impact the scope and nature of the proceeding, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from this matter. We dispute the class-action claims and intend to continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) X2Y Attenuators, LLC v. Intel et al In May 2011, X2Y Attenuators, LLC (X2Y) filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania and a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) pursuant to Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 against us and two of our customers, Apple and Hewlett-Packard Company, alleging infringement of five patents. X2Y subsequently added a sixth patent to both actions. The district court action is stayed pending resolution of the ITC proceeding. X2Y alleges that at least Intel   Core  and Intel   Xeon   processor families infringe the asserted patents. X2Y also requests that the ITC issue permanent exclusion and cease-and-desist orders to, among other things, prohibit us from importing these microprocessors and Apple and Hewlett-Packard Company products that incorporate these microprocessors into the United States. In the district court action, X2Y seeks unspecified damages, including enhanced damages for alleged willful infringement, and injunctive relief. On June 13, 2012, the Administrative Law Judge issued an initial determination granting X2Ys motion to partially terminate the ITC investigation with respect to three of the asserted patents. The Administrative Law Judge held a hearing on the remaining three patents in August 2012 and issued an initial determination in December 2012. In the initial determination, the Administrative Law Judge found that Intel, Apple, and Hewlett-Packard Company have not violated Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 because they have not infringed any of the asserted claims of the three patents, and ruled that the asserted claims of two of the patents were invalid. In December 2012, the parties filed petitions for review of the initial determination by the ITC. In February 2013, the ITC determined to review in part the initial determination. On review, the ITC determined to reverse or vacate certain findings, and to terminate the investigation with a finding of no violation. In April 2013, X2Y filed a Notice of Appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Given the procedural posture and nature of the cases, including the fact that resolution of the appeal of the ITC ' s decision may materially impact the scope and nature of the proceeding, the fact that monetary damages are not an available remedy in the ITC, and that discovery regarding X2Ys claimed damages has not commenced in the stayed district court action, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from these matters. We dispute the claims and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. Note 27: Operating Segments and Geographic Information  Our operating segments in effect as of December 28, 2013 , include: ##TABLE_START  PC Client Group   Software and services operating segments:  Data Center Group   McAfee  Other Intel architecture operating segments:   Wind River Software Group  Intelligent Systems Group   Software and Services Group  Multi-Comm   All other:  Phone Group   Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group  Service Provider Group    Tablet Group    Netbook Group    New Devices Group   ##TABLE_ENDIn 2013, we completed a reorganization that transferred a portion of our wired connectivity business formerly included within DCG to PCCG, as the technology from that portion of the business is primarily used for client connectivity. Prior period amounts have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect this new organization structure. We reorganized our IMC businesses within the \"other Intel architecture\" operating segments to segment our focus on the phone business. As part of this reorganization, we separated the feature and entry phone component business into the existing Phone Group operating segment and renamed the remaining business, primarily discrete modems, as the Multi-Comm operating segment. In May 2013, Brian Krzanich became our CEO and a member of Intel's Board of Directors, succeeding Paul S. Otellini, who retired from the Board and as CEO. Since his appointment as CEO, Mr. Krzanich made management organizational changes which did not result in a change to the businesses comprising our operating segments or to the conclusion that the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is the CEO. The CODM allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about its revenue and operating income (loss). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) PCCG and DCG are our reportable operating segments. We also aggregate and disclose the financial results of our non-reportable operating segments within other Intel architecture operating segments and software and services operating segments as shown in the above operating segments list. Each of these aggregated operating segments does not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as a reportable operating segment; however, we have elected to disclose the aggregation of these non-reportable operating segments. Revenue for our reportable and aggregated non-reportable operating segments is primarily related to the following product lines: ##TABLE_START  PC Client Group . Includes platforms designed for the notebook (including Ultrabook  devices and 2 in 1 systems), desktop (including all-in-ones and high-end enthusiast PCs), and certain tablet market segments; and wireless and wired connectivity products. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Data Center Group. Includes platforms designed for the server, workstation, and storage computing market segments; and wired network connectivity products. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Intel architecture operating segments. Includes platforms designed for embedded applications for communications, medical, automotive, industrial, retail, and other market segments; mobile components such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers, WiFi, Bluetooth  , global navigation satellite system, and power management chips; platforms designed for the tablet market segment; platforms designed for the smartphone market segment; gateway and set-top box components; and platforms designed for the netbook market segment; delivering reference devices and technology platforms ready to be used by customers as well as System-on-Chip architecture specifically designed for wearable and other emerging compute opportunities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Software and services operating segments. Includes software products for endpoint security, network and content security, risk and compliance, and consumer and mobile security from our McAfee business; software optimized products for the embedded and mobile market segments; and software products and services that promote Intel architecture as the platform of choice for software development. ##TABLE_END We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments, and the expenses are included in the operating results reported below. The all other category includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as: ##TABLE_START  results of operations from our Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group that includes NAND flash memory products for use in a variety of devices; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  amounts included within restructuring and asset impairment charges; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a portion of profit-dependent compensation and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  divested businesses for which discrete operating results are not reviewed by our CODM; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives, including our foundry business; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. ##TABLE_END The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. As our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segments operating income (loss) results. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Except for these differences, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  Net revenue and operating income (loss) for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)    Net revenue:       PC Client Group  $ 33,039  $ 34,504  $ 35,624 Data Center Group  11,238  10,511  9,911 Other Intel architecture operating segments  4,092  4,378  5,005 Software and services operating segments  2,502  2,381  1,870 All other  1,837  1,567  1,589 Total net revenue  $ 52,708  $ 53,341  $ 53,999        Operating income (loss):       PC Client Group  $ 11,827  $ 13,106  $ 14,840 Data Center Group  5,164  5,020  5,053 Other Intel architecture operating segments  (2,445 )  (1,377 )  (577 ) Software and services operating segments   (11 )  (32 ) All other  (2,256 )  (2,100 )  (1,807 ) Total operating income  $ 12,291  $ 14,638  $ 17,477 ##TABLE_ENDIn 2013 , Hewlett-Packard Company accounted for 17% of our net revenue ( 18% in 2012 and 19% in 2011 ), Dell Inc. accounted for 15% of our net revenue ( 14% in 2012 and 15% in 2011 ), and Lenovo Group Limited accounted for 12% of our net revenue ( 11% in 2012 and 9% in 2011 ). The majority of the revenue from these customers was from the sale of platforms and other components by the PCCG and the DCG operating segments. Most of our revenue in the PCCG and DCG operating segments is generated from the sale of platforms. Net revenue by country for the three years ended December 28, 2013 , is based on the billing location of the customer.

San Jose, California February 14, 2014  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intel Corporation We have audited Intel Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework) (the COSO criteria). Intel Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Intel Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2013 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2013 consolidated financial statements of Intel Corporation and our report dated February 14, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on managements evaluation (with the participation of our CEO and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 28, 2013 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2013 , the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework). Managements assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst  Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting, as stated in the firms attestation report, which is included at the end of Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END Company Overview We design and manufacture advanced integrated digital technology platforms. A platform consists of a microprocessor and chipset, and may be enhanced by additional hardware, software, and services. We sell these platforms primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs), and industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries . Our platforms are used to deliver a wide range of computing experiences in notebooks (including Ultrabook  devices), 2 in 1 systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, and the Internet of Things ( including wearables, transportation systems, and retail devices ). We also develop and sell software and services primarily focused on security and technology integration. We were incorporated in California in 1968 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1989. Company Strategy Our vision is if it is smart and connected, it is best with Intel. As a result, we offer complete and connected computing solutions, both hardware and software, and continue to drive \"Moores Law.\" Over time, the number of devices connected to the Internet and to one another has grown from hundreds of millions to billions. This number continues to grow and the variety of devices also continues to increase. The combination of embedding computing into devices and connecting them to the Internet, known as the Internet of Things, as well as a build-out of the cloud infrastructure supporting these devices, is driving fundamental changes in the computing industry. As a result, we are transforming our primary focus from the design and manufacture of semiconductor chips for personal computers (PCs) and servers to the delivery of more complete platform solutions consisting of hardware and software platforms and supporting services. These solutions span the compute continuum, from high-performance computing systems running trillions of operations per second to embedded applications consuming milliwatts of power. Additionally, computing is becoming an increasingly mobile, personal, and ubiquitous experience. End users value smart devices that connect seamlessly and securely to the Internet and to each other. We enable this experience by innovating around energy-efficient performance, connectivity, and security. To succeed in this changing computing environment, we have the following key objectives: ##TABLE_START  relentless pursuit of Moore's Law to maximize and extend our manufacturing technology leadership; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  strive to ensure that Intel  technology is the best choice across the compute continuum, including PCs, data centers, ultra-mobile devices, and the Internet of Things; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expand platforms into adjacent market segments to bring compelling new System-on-Chip (SoC) solutions and user experiences to ultra-mobile form factors including tablets and smartphones, as well as PC platforms (including Ultrabook devices, 2 in 1 systems, and all-in-ones), data center applications, and the Internet of Things ( including wearables, transportation systems, and retail devices ); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increase the utilization of our investments in intellectual property and research and development (RD) across all market segments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  be the platform of choice for any operating system; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expand data center, security, and big data analytics; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  scale our manufacturing capabilities into foundry; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  strive to reduce the environmental footprint of our products and operations as well as be an asset to the communities we work in. ##TABLE_END We use our core assets to meet these objectives.

Our core assets and key objectives include the following: ##TABLE_START  Silicon and Manufacturing Technology Leadership. We have long been a leader in silicon process technology and manufacturing, and we aim to continue our lead through investment and innovation in this critical area. Moore's Law predicted that transistor density on integrated circuits would double about every two years. We continue executing to Moores Law by enabling new devices with higher functionality and complexity while controlling power, cost, and size. In keeping with Moore's Law, we drive a regular and predictable upgrade cycleintroducing a new microarchitecture approximately every two to three years and ramping the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening periods . We refer to this as our \"tick-tock\" technology development cadence. Through this cycle, we continue to push progress by designing and putting transistor innovations into high-volume production. We aim to have the best process technology, and unlike many semiconductor companies, we primarily manufacture our products in our own facilities. This in-house manufacturing capability enables us to optimize performance, shorten our time to market, and scale new products more rapidly. We believe this competitive advantage will be extended in the future as the costs to build leading-edge fabrication facilities increase, and as fewer semiconductor companies will be able to combine platform design and manufacturing. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Architecture and Platforms. We are developing a wide range of solutions for devices that span the compute continuum and allow for computing experiences in notebooks, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, and the Internet of Things. We believe that users want consistent computing experiences and interoperable devices and that users and developers value consistency of architecture. This provides a common framework that results in shortened time-to-market, increased innovation, and the ability to leverage technologies across multiple form factors. We believe that we can meet the needs of users and developers to offer complete solutions across the compute continuum through our partnership with the industry on open, standards-based platform innovation around Intel  architecture. We continue to invest in improving Intel architecture to deliver increased value to our customers and expand the capabilities of the architecture in adjacent market segments.

Business Organization In Q1 2014, we made certain changes to our organizational structure to align with our critical objectives. As of December 27, 2014 , we managed our business through the following operating segments: For a description of our operating segments, see \" Note 26: Operating Segments and Geographic Information \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Products Platforms We offer platforms that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package. A platform may be enhanced by additional hardware, software, and services. A microprocessorthe central processing unit (CPU) of a computer systemprocesses system data and controls other devices in the system. We offer microprocessors with one or multiple processor cores. Multi-core microprocessors can enable improved multitasking and energy-efficient performance by distributing computing tasks across two or more cores. In addition, our Intel  Core  processor families integrate graphics functionality onto the processor die. A chipset sends data between the microprocessor and input, display, and storage devices, such as the keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard drive or solid-state drive, and optical disc drives. Chipsets extend the audio, video, and other capabilities of many systems and perform essential logic functions, such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks. We offer and continue to develop SoC products that integrate our CPUs with other system components, such as graphics, audio, imaging, communication and connectivity, and video, onto a single chip. SoC products are designed to reduce total cost of ownership, provide improved performance due to higher integration and the lowest power, and enable ultra-mobile form factors such as tablets, smartphones, Ultrabook devices, and 2 in 1 systems, as well as notebooks, desktops, data center products, and the Internet of Things. We offer a multichip package that integrates the chipset on one die with the CPU and graphics on another die, connected via a lower-power, on-package interface. Similar to an SoC, the multichip package can provide improved performance due to higher integration coupled with the lowest power consumption, which enables smaller form factors. In 2014, we introduced our 5th generation Intel Core processor, code-named \"Broadwell.\" We also offer features designed to improve our platform capabilities. For example, Intel  vPro  technology is a solution for manageability, security, and business user experiences in the notebook, desktop, and 2 in 1 systems market segments. Intel vPro technology is designed to provide businesses with increased manageability, upgradeability, energy-efficient performance, and security while lowering the total cost of ownership. We also offer Intel  Iris  technology, which provides enhanced integrated graphics for our 4th and 5th generation Intel Core processors. In 2014, we announced Intel RealSense technology, which includes software and depth cameras that enable more natural and intuitive interaction with personal computing devices. We offer a range of platforms based upon the following microprocessors: McAfee, Inc. McAfee, Inc. (McAfee) offers software and hardware products that provide security solutions designed to protect systems in consumer, mobile, and corporate environments from malicious virus attacks and loss of data.

These computers combine the energy-efficient performance and capabilities of todays notebooks and tablets with enhanced graphics and improved user interfaces such as touch and voice in a thin, light form factor that is highly responsive and secure, and that can seamlessly connect to the Internet. In 2014, we introduced the Intel  Core  M processor, our first commercially available 14nm processor designed to enable responsive performance and improved battery life for new tablet-thin, fanless devices. We believe the renewed innovation in the PC industry that we fostered with Ultrabook devices and expanded to 2 in 1 systems will continue. Desktop Our strategy for the desktop computing market segment is to offer exciting new user experiences and products that provide increased manageability, security, and energy-efficient performance. We are also focused on lowering the total cost of ownership for businesses. The desktop computing market segment includes all-in-one desktop products, which combine traditionally separate desktop components into one form factor. Additionally, all-in-one computers have transformed into portable and flexible form factors that offer users increased portability and new multi-user applications and uses. For desktop consumers, we also focus on the design of products for high-end enthusiast PCs and mainstream PCs with rapidly increasing audio and media capabilities. Our Data Center Group operating segment offers products designed to provide leading energy-efficient performance for all server, network, and storage platforms. In addition, the Data Center Group (DCG) focuses on lowering the total cost of ownership and on other specific optimizations for the enterprise, cloud, communications infrastructure, and technical computing segments. In 2014, we launched our next-generation Intel Xeon processor E5 family platform for our 22nm process technology. The 22nm Intel Xeon processors provide improved performance and better power consumption across server, network, and storage platforms. We also launched our next-generation Intel Xeon processor E7 family. These products are targeted at platforms requiring four or more CPUs and industry leading reliability, availability, and serviceability. DCG is continuing to ramp the Intel  Xeon Phi  coprocessor with 60 or more high-performance, low-power Intel processor cores. The Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors are positioned to boost the power of the worlds most advanced supercomputers, enabling trillions of calculations per second. Our Internet of Things  Group operating segment offers platforms for customers to design products for the retail, transportation, industrial, and buildings and home market segments. In addition, the Internet of Things Group (IOTG) focuses on establishing an end-to-end secure and manageable architecture that captures actionable information for consumers. In 2014, we shipped our first Intel Quark SoC 32-bit microprocessor. We also launched the Intel  Edison development platform, which is designed to empower the next generation of wearables, robotics, and other small devices connecting, creating, and consuming data. Our Mobile and Communications Group operating segment offers products that incorporate hardware, software, and connectivity for tablets, smartphones, and other mobile devices. In addition, our Mobile and Communications Group (MCG) focuses on a broad range of wireless connectivity options by combining Intel  WiFi technology with our 2G and 3G technologies, and creating a path to accelerate industry adoption of 4G LTE. In 2014, we began selling our second-generation LTE solution, featuring CAT6 and carrier aggregation. In addition, MCG developed the first Intel Atom SoC application processor integrated with leading global 3G modem, code-named \"SoFIA.\" SoFIA is designed for the entry and value mobile devices market segment. Our software and services operating segments seek to create differentiated user experiences on Intel  -based platforms. We differentiate by combining Intel platform features and enhanced software and services. Our three primary initiatives are: ##TABLE_START  enabling platforms that can be used across multiple operating systems, applications, and services across all Intel products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  optimizing features and performance by enabling the software ecosystem to quickly take advantage of new platform features and capabilities; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  enable a more secure online experience by using software, services, and hardware to deliver comprehensive solutions, such as our McAfee LiveSafe* service, which provides a comprehensive security suite that offers consumer protection across a range of devices such as PCs, tablets, and smartphones. ##TABLE_END 7 Revenue by Major Operating Segment Net revenue for the PC Client Group (PCCG) operating segment, the Data Center Group (DCG) operating segment, the Internet of Things Group (IOTG) operating segment, the Mobile and Communications Group (MCG) operating segment, and the aggregated software and services (SSG) operating segments is presented as a percentage of our consolidated net revenue.

Percentage of Revenue by Major Operating Segment (Dollars in Millions) Percentage of Revenue by Principal Product from Reportable Segments* (Dollars in Millions) *Note images are not to scale Competition The computing industry continuously evolves with new and enhanced technologies and products from existing and new providers. The marketplace can change quickly in response to the introduction of such technologies and products and other factors such as changes in customer and end-user requirements, expectations, and preferences. As technologies evolve and new market segments emerge, the boundaries between the market segments that we compete in are also subject to change. Intel faces significant competition in the development and market acceptance of our products in this environment. Our platforms, based on Intel architecture, are positioned to compete across the compute continuum, from the lowest power and ultra-mobile devices to the most powerful data center servers. Our platforms, which have integrated hardware and software, offer customers benefits such as ease of use, savings in total cost of ownership, and the ability to scale systems to accommodate increased usage. Competitors We compete against other companies that make and sell platforms, other silicon components, and software to businesses that build and sell computing and communications devices to end users. Our competitors also include companies that sell goods and services to businesses that utilize them for their internal and/or customer-facing processes (e.g., businesses running large data centers). In addition, we face competition from OEMs, ODMs, and other industrial and communications equipment manufacturers that, to some degree, choose to vertically integrate their own proprietary semiconductor and software assets. By doing so, these competitors may be attempting to offer greater differentiation in their products and to increase their share of the profits for each finished product they sell. Continuing changes in industry participants through, for example, acquisitions or business collaborations could also have a significant impact on our competitive position. We are a leading provider in the PC and data center segments, where we face existing and emerging competition. In the PC market segment, ultra-mobile devicessuch as tablets and smartphones offered by numerous vendors have become significant competitors to PCs for many usages. Most of these small devices currently use applications processors based on the ARM* architecture; feature low-power, long battery-life operation; and are built in SoC formats that integrate numerous functions on one chip. In the data center segment, our data center platforms face emerging competition from companies using ARM architecture or other technologies. Internet cloud computing and high-performance computing are areas of significant targeted growth for us in the data center segment, and we face strong competition in these market segments. We are a relatively new entrant to the segments for tablets, smartphones, and similar ultra-mobile devices. We have adjusted our product roadmaps to emphasize the development of low-power SoC chips for such devices, as well the Internet of Things. In the Internet of Things market segment, we have a long-standing position as a supplier of components and software for embedded products, and this marketplace is significantly expanding with increasing types and numbers of smart and connected devices for industrial, commercial, and consumer uses. In this growing market segment, we face numerous large and small incumbent competitors as well as new entrants that use ARM architecture and other operating systems and software. McAfee is a major provider of digital security products and services to businesses and consumers. Numerous competitors offer security products and services, and we seek to offer competitive differentiation by integrating hardware and software security features in many of our offerings and to have security offerings in numerous market segments, including mobile and embedded devices and for data centers. Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, innovative design, features, price, quality, reliability, brand recognition, and availability. The importance of these factors will vary by the type of end system for the products. For example, performance might be among the most important factors for our products for data center servers, while price and integration might be among the most important factors for our products for tablets , smartphones, and other mobile devices. Competitive Advantages Our products' ability to operate on multiple operating systems in end-user products and platforms operated or sold by third parties, including OEMs, is a key competitive advantage. We seek to optimize our products for multiple operating systems and invest substantial resources working with third parties to do so, but such investments are risky given that it is not clear which products will succeed in the market. Another key competitive advantage is our market lead in transitioning to the next-generation process technology and bringing products to market using such technology. We have products in the market manufactured using our 14nm process technology and are currently working on the development of our next-generation 10nm process technology. We believe that these transitions will offer significant improvements in one or more of the following areas: performance, new features, energy efficiency, and cost . Moreover, the combination of our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities with our global architecture design teams is another important competitive advantage. We have made significant capital and RD investments into this integrated manufacturing network, which enables us to have more direct control over our processes, quality control, product cost, production timing, performance, power consumption, and manufacturing yield. The increased cost of constructing new fabrication facilities supporting smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers has led to a smaller pool of companies that can afford to build and equip leading-edge manufacturing facilities. Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries and subcontractors such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. and GlobalFoundries Inc. for manufacturing and assembly and test needs. We provide foundry services as an alternative to such foundries. Manufacturing and Assembly and Test As of December 27, 2014 , 70% of our wafer fabrication, including microprocessors and chipsets, was conducted within the U.S. at our facilities in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, and Massachusetts. Our Massachusetts fabrication facility is our last manufacturing facility on 200 millimeter (mm) wafers and is expected to cease production in Q1 2015. The remaining 30% of our wafer fabrication was conducted outside the U.S. at our facilities in Israel and China. Our fabrication facility in Ireland is currently transitioning to our 14nm process technology, with manufacturing expected to ramp in the second half of 2015. Wafer fabrication conducted within and outside the U.S. may be impacted by the timing of a facilitys transition to a newer process technology, as well as a facilitys capacity utilization. As of December 27, 2014 , we manufactured our products in wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations: ##TABLE_START Products  Wafer Size  Process Technology  Locations Microprocessors  300mm  14nm  Arizona, Oregon Microprocessors  300mm  22nm  Israel, Arizona, Oregon Microprocessors and chipsets  300mm  32nm  New Mexico Microprocessors  300mm  45nm  New Mexico Chipsets  300mm  65nm  China Chipsets and other products  300mm  90nm  China Chipsets  200mm  130nm  Massachusetts ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 27, 2014 , a substantial majority of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers using our 14nm, 22nm, and 32nm process technology. As we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology, we incur significant start-up costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing. However, continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs. The benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor, reducing heat output from each transistor, and increasing the number of integrated features on each chip. These advancements can result in new devices with higher functionality and complexity while controlling power, cost, and size. In addition, with each shift to a new process technology, we are able to produce more microprocessors per square foot of our wafer fabrication facilities. The costs to develop our process technology are significantly less than adding capacity by building additional wafer fabrication facilities using older process technology. We use third-party foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components, including communication and connectivity products. In 2014, we qualified our first SoC application processor and baseband 3G solution, code-named \"SoFIA,\" which will be fabricated by a third-party foundry. In addition, we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture board-level products and systems. We purchase certain communication and connectivity products from external vendors primarily in the Asia-Pacific region. Following the manufacturing process, the majority of our components are subject to assembly and test. We perform our components assembly and test at facilities in Malaysia, China, and Vietnam . Our assembly and test facility in Costa Rica ceased production in Q4 2014. To augment capacity, we use subcontractors to perform assembly and test of certain products, primarily chipsets and communication and connectivity products. Our NAND flash memory products are manufactured by IMFT and Micron using 20nm or 25nm process technology, and assembly and test of these products is performed by Micron and other external subcontractors. For further information, see \" Note 5: Cash and Investments \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our employment and operating practices are consistent with, and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by, local country law. Intel expects all suppliers to comply with our Code of Conduct and the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct, both of which set standards that address the rights of workers to safe and healthy working conditions, environmental responsibility, compliance with privacy and data security obligations, and compliance with applicable laws. We have thousands of suppliers, including subcontractors, providing our various materials, equipment, and service needs. We set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments and audits. We communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources, but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country. In those cases, we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply. We have entered into long-term contracts with certain suppliers to help ensure a stable supply of silicon and semiconductor manufacturing tools. Our products are typically manufactured at multiple Intel facilities around the world or by subcontractors. However, some products are manufactured in only one Intel or subcontractor facility, and we seek to implement action plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility. See \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Research and Development We are committed to investing in world-class technology development, particularly in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits. RD expenditures were $11.5 billion in 2014 ( $10.6 billion in 2013 and $10.1 billion in 2012 ). Our RD activities are directed toward the delivery of solutions consisting of hardware and software platforms and supporting services across a wide range of computing devices. We are focused on developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products, which will in turn enable new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers. We focus our RD efforts on advanced computing technologies, developing new microarchitectures, advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology, delivering the next generation of platforms, improving our platform initiatives, developing new solutions in emerging technologies including memory and the Internet of Things, as well as developing software solutions and tools. Our RD efforts are intended to enable new levels of performance and address areas such as energy efficiency, system-level integration, security, scalability for multi-core architectures, system manageability, and ease of use. As part of our RD efforts, we plan to introduce a new Intel Core microarchitecture for desktops, notebooks (including Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems), and Intel Xeon processors approximately every two to three years and ramping the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening periods . We refer to this as our \"tick-tock\" technology development cadence, as illustrated below. Advances in our silicon technology have enabled us to continue making Moores Law a reality. In 2014, we began manufacturing our 5th generation Intel Core processor family using our 14nm process technology. We are currently developing our next-generation Intel  microarchitecture, code-named \"Skylake,\" using our 14nm process technology, which we expect to release in the second half of 2015. We are also developing 10nm manufacturing process technology, our next-generation process technology. We have continued expanding on the advances anticipated by Moores Law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products optimized for a wider variety of applications. We have accelerated the Intel Atom processor-based SoC roadmap for ultra-mobile form factors, including tablets and smartphones, as well as notebooks (including Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems), the Internet of Things, and data center applications, from 32nm through 22nm to 14nm. Our Intel Atom processors for ultra-mobile form factors and the Internet of Things are transitioning to the same process technology as our leading-edge products. We expect that this acceleration will result in a significant reduction in transistor leakage, lower active power, and an increase in transistor density to enable more powerful, feature-rich smartphones and tablets with a longer battery life. The Intel  Quark SoC is an ultra-low-power and low-cost architecture designed for the Internet of Things, from industrial machines to wearable devices. With our continued focus on silicon and manufacturing technology leadership, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) in 2012, certain of which were amended in 2014 to further define the commercial terms between the parties. These amended agreements, in which Intel agreed to provide RD funding over five years, are intended to accelerate the development of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography projects and deep ultraviolet immersion lithography projects, including generic developments applicable to both 300mm and 450mm. Our RD activities range from designing and developing new products and manufacturing processes to researching future technologies and products. We continue to make significant RD investments in the development of SoCs to enable growth in ultra-mobile form factors. In addition, we continue to make significant investments in communications and connectivity for tablets, smartphones, and other connected devices, including mutlimode LTE modems. Our investment in Cloudera, completed in 2014, is evidence of our drive to bring big data analytics to the mainstream market through the joining of Cloudera's software platform and our data center architecture based on Intel Xeon processors. We also continue to invest in leading-edge foundry platforms and ecosystem partner development, graphics, high-performance computing, and communication and connectivity. Our RD model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies, leading standards initiatives, and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies, including joint pathfinding conducted between researchers at Intel Labs and our business groups. We centrally manage key cross-business group product initiatives to align and prioritize our RD activities across these groups. In addition, we may augment our RD activities by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar RD focus areas, as well as directly purchasing or licensing technology applicable to our RD initiatives. To drive innovation and gain efficiencies, we intend to utilize our investments in intellectual property and RD across our market segments. Employees As of December 27, 2014 , we had 106,700 employees worldwide, with approximately 51% of those employees located in the U.S. Sales and Marketing Customers We sell our products primarily to OEMs and ODMs. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, we sell our products to other manufacturers, including makers of a wide range of industrial and communications equipment. Our customers also include those who buy PC components and our other products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customerssystems builders that purchase Intel  microprocessors and other products from our distributors. We have a program that allows distributors to sell our microprocessors and other products in small quantities to customers of systems builders; our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets. In 2014 , Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) accounted for 18% of our net revenue ( 17% in 2013 and 18% in 2012 ), Dell Inc. (Dell) accounted for 16% of our net revenue ( 15% in 2013 and 14% in 2012 ), and Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo) accounted for 12% of our net revenue ( 12% in 2013 and 11% in 2012 ). No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue during such periods. For information about net revenue and operating income by operating segment, and net revenue from unaffiliated customers by country, see \" Note 26: Operating Segments and Geographic Information \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Sales Arrangements Our products are sold through sales offices throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, private-label branding, and other matters. Our sales are typically made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology. Our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer, even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related cost of sales is deferred. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, generally 30 days after shipment or delivery. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. For information about our allowance for doubtful receivables, see \"Schedule IIValuation and Qualifying Accounts\" in Part IV of this Form 10-K. Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. We have the option to grant credit for, repair, or replace defective products, and there is no contractual limit on the amount of credit that may be granted to a distributor for defective products. Distribution Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers. Backlog Over time, our larger customers have generally moved to lean-inventory or just-in-time operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products. As our customers continue to lower their inventories, our processes to fulfill their orders have evolved to meet their needs. As a result, our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance non-binding commitments from customers as to future purchases. Our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Only a small portion of our orders are non-cancelable, and the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant. Seasonal Trends Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. Marketing Our global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known Intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel Quark, Intel Atom, Intel  Celeron  , Intel  Pentium  , Intel Xeon, Intel Xeon Phi, and Intel  Itanium  trademarks make up our processor brands. We promote brand awareness and preference, and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and press relations. We market to consumer and business audiences, and focus on building awareness and generating demand for new form factors such as tablets, Ultrabook devices, and 2 in 1 systems powered by Intel. Our key messaging focuses on increased performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as connectivity, communications, and security. Purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the Intel Inside  Program. This program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Through the Intel Inside Program, certain customers are licensed to place Intel logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to customers meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers. Intellectual Property Rights and Licensing Intel owns significant intellectual property (IP) and related IP rights around the world that relate to our products, services, RD, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress rights, and maskwork rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. Such efforts can be difficult, however, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right. See \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A, and \" Note 25: Contingencies \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We have obtained patents in the U.S. and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, and the comparative pace of governments patenting processes, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire; in some cases, our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are granted. As we expand our products into new industries, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products. In addition to developing patents based on our own RD efforts, we purchase patents from third parties to supplement our patent portfolio. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other IP, may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our component-level and platform products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. Compliance with Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations Our compliance efforts focus on monitoring regulatory and resource trends and setting company-wide performance targets for key resources and emissions. These targets address several parameters, including product design; chemical, energy, and water use; waste recycling; the source of certain minerals used in our products; climate change; and emissions. As a company, we focus on reducing natural resource use, the solid and chemical waste by-products of our manufacturing processes, and the environmental impact of our products. We currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety (EHS) laws and regulations. Over the past several years, we have significantly reduced the use of lead and halogenated flame retardants in our products and manufacturing processes. We work with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), OEMs, and retailers to help manage e-waste (including electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives) and to promote recycling. The European Union requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that let consumers return products for recycling. Many U.S. states and countries in Latin America and Asia also have or are developing similar e-waste take-back laws. Although these laws are typically targeted at the end electronic product and not the component products that we manufacture, the inconsistency of many e-waste take-back laws and the lack of local e-waste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts. We are an industry leader in our efforts to build ethical sourcing of minerals for our products, including \"conflict minerals\" from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. In 2013, we accomplished our goal to manufacture microprocessors that are DRC conflict-free for tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold. We continue our work to establish DRC conflict-free supply chains for our company and our industry, and have set a new goal that all products currently on our roadmap for 2016 and beyond will be DRC conflict-free for these four minerals. We seek to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers to improve energy efficiency. We take a holistic approach to power management, addressing the challenge at the silicon, package, circuit, microarchitecture, macroarchitecture, platform, and software levels. We recognize that climate change may cause general economic risk. For further information on the risks of climate change, see \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We see a potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations. This could include items applied to utility companies that are passed along to customers, such as carbon taxes or costs associated with obtaining permits for our manufacturing operations, emission cap and trade programs, or renewable portfolio standards. We are committed to sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives and working proactively with governments, environmental groups, and industry to promote global environmental sustainability. We believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the worlds environmental challenges, and we are joining forces with industry, business, and governments to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to combat climate change. We have been purchasing renewable energy at some of our major sites for several years. We purchase renewable energy certificates under a multi-year contract. This purchase has placed Intel at the top of the EPAs Green Power Partnership for the past seven years and is intended to help stimulate the market for green power, leading to additional generating capacity and, ultimately, lower costs.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END The following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and our financial statements and the related notes. Changes in product demand can harm our results of operation and financial condition. Demand for our products is variable and hard to predict.  Changes in the demand for our products may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us to write down the value of our assets. Important factors that could lead to variation in the demand for our products include changes in: ##TABLE_START  business conditions, including downturns in the computing industry, or in the global or regional economies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  consumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the level of our customers inventories; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  customer product needs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  market acceptance of our products and maturing product cycles; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the technology supply chain, including supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. ##TABLE_END We face significant competition.  The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we do not anticipate and respond to these developments, our competitive position may weaken, and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete. Over recent years, our business focus has expanded and now includes the design and production of platforms for tablets, smartphones, and other devices across the compute continuum, including products for the Internet of Things, and related services. As a result, we face new sources of competition, including, in certain of these market segments, from incumbent competitors with established customer bases and greater brand recognition. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, integration, and energy efficiency of our products as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain consumer and market acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments. To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful RD effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors. For example, we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, including the construction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers. Our RD efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems, and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, and the products we invest in and develop may not be well-received by customers. Our RD investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years, and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. Additionally, the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for, or pricing of, our products. If we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including increased costs and reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets. Changes in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results. Prices differ widely among the platforms we offer in our various market segments due to differences in features offered or manufacturing costs. For example, product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms such as those based on Intel Quark or Intel Atom processors to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon and Intel Itanium processors. If there is a shift in demand from our higher-priced to lower-priced platforms in any of our market segments, our gross margin and revenue would decrease. In addition, when products are initially introduced, they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross margin. We operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions. Global or regional conditions may harm our financial results. We have manufacturing, assembly and test, RD, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 82% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2014. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including: ##TABLE_START  global and local economic conditions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, and terrorist activity; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  natural disasters, public health issues, and other catastrophic events; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  government restrictions on, or nationalization of our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  differing employment practices and labor issues; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  formal or informal imposition of new or revised export and/or import and doing-business regulations, which could be changed without notice; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices. We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, employment, environment, health, and safety. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive and such requirements may differ among jurisdictions. ##TABLE_END Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, and/or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. We may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as overseas capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations or systems could be disrupted by natural disasters; geopolitical conditions; terrorist activity; public health issues; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation or telecommunications providers; or other catastrophic events. Such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions. We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. We place our insurance coverage with multiple carriers in numerous jurisdictions. However, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies have deductibles and exclusions that result in us retaining a level of self-insurance. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. We operate our own fabrication facilities and, as a result, are vulnerable to manufacturing-related risks. Due to the variability in demand for our products, we may be unable to timely respond to reduce costs when demand declines or to increase production when demand increases. Our operations have high costs that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to manufacturing, such as facility construction and equipment, RD, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. Our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. Factory-planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation. Conversely, if product demand increases, we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand. Our revenue and gross margin can also be affected by the timing of our product introductions and related expenses, including marketing expenses. We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology. We may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. We are continually engaged in the transition from our existing process to the next-generation process technology. This consistent innovation involves significant expense and carries inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process technologies, development and production timing delays, lower than anticipated manufacturing yields, and product defects and errata. Disruptions in the production process can also result from errors, defects in materials, interruption in our supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditionsall of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues can lead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand, which could adversely impact our business and the results from operations. We face supply chain risks. We have thousands of suppliers providing materials that we use in production and other aspects of our business. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials. However, for certain materials, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. In addition, consolidation among suppliers could impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us. The inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. Production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations. We also rely on third-party providers to manufacture, assemble and test certain components or products, particularly for our networking, mobile and communications, and NAND flash memory businesses. If any of these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely basis, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions that could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, there are regulatory and other requirements, restrictions, and requests from various constituencies regarding sourcing practices and supplier conduct, with a trend toward expanding the scope of materials and locations where materials originate, regulating supplier behaviors, and increasing the required disclosures regarding such matters by public companies. Increased regulation and public pressure in this area would cause our compliance costs to increase and could negatively affect our reputation given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials, but do not directly control their procurement or employment practices. We are subject to the risks of product defects and errata. Product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) may result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Costs from defects and errata could include: ##TABLE_START  writing off some or all of the value of inventory; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  recalling products that have been shipped; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  providing product replacements or modifications; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  defending against resulting litigation. ##TABLE_END These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and result in delay or loss of revenue. Our reputation with customers or end users could be damaged as a result of product defects and errata, and product demand could be reduced. The announcement of product defects and errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of our components or for other reasons. Any of these occurrences could harm our business and financial results. We are subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations. The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of EHS laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in: ##TABLE_START  regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  suspension of production; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  alteration of our fabrication and assembly and test processes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reputational challenges; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  restrictions on our operations or sales. ##TABLE_END Our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Our ability to grow or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements. Environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. For example, climate change regulation could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution control requirements, and increased or new monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. We also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations if, for example, utility companies pass on their costs to their customers. Furthermore, many of our operations are located in semi-arid regions that may become increasingly vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. Our fabrication facilities have significant water use and, while we recycle and reuse a portion of the water used, we may have difficulties obtaining sufficient water to fulfill our operational needs due the lack of available infrastructure. We are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. We may be unable to enforce or protect our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others to protect our IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that the IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to the opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in the other party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. Governments may adopt regulationsand governments or courts may render decisionsrequiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in RD, product development, and marketing could be reduced. Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights. Companies in our industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Our competitors may have licenses to our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses may exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired. Third parties may assert claims based on IP rights against us or our products, which could harm our business. We may face claims based on IP rights from individuals and companies, including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies. We are normally engaged in a number of litigation matters involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, whether or not meritorious, could cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. In addition, we may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. As a result of IP rights claims, we could: ##TABLE_START  pay monetary damages, including payments to satisfy indemnification obligations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  enter into settlement and license agreements, which agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. ##TABLE_END These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed. We rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of our products include third-party IP and/or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party IP, or to use such IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. We are subject to the risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. We may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. As described in \" Note 25: Contingencies \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and distracting to management. We must attract, retain, and motivate key employees. To be competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based and other performance-based incentive awards such as restricted stock units and cash bonuses. If our share-based or other compensation programs cease to be viewed as competitive and valuable benefits, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. We are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks. Third parties might attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network or seek to compromise our products and services. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our information technology (IT) systems. Additionally, malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide. Due to the widespread use of our products and due to the high profile of our McAfee subsidiary, we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others. We believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication. From time to time we encounter intrusions or attempts at gaining unauthorized access to our products, services, and network. To date, none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations. In some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and/or changes or patches to our products and services, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. Such incidents, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, reduced inventory value, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. Publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers or users, and reduce demand for our products and services. We may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance regulatory environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, our even inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. We are subject to risks associated with strategic transactions. We invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments. We make investments in public and private companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Many of the securities in which we invest are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. Companies in which we invest range from early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on the availability to the company of additional funding on favorable terms, or a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. If any of the companies in which we invest fail, we could lose all or part of our investment. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment, we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize a loss. Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions could fail to achieve strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations.  In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions, such as joint ventures. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to complete an acquisition has opportunity costs and we may need to forego the prospect of acquiring other companies or technologies that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. In addition to opportunity costs, these transactions involve large challenges and risks, including risks that: ##TABLE_START  the transaction may not advance our business strategy; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may be unable to identify opportunities on terms acceptable to us; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may not realize a satisfactory return; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may experience disruption of our ongoing operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may be unable to retain key personnel; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may experience difficulty in integrating new employees, business systems, and technology; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  acquired businesses may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our due diligence process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may have difficulty entering new market segments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may be unable to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses; and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  there may be unknown, underestimated, and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities. ##TABLE_END When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed-upon terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expense, or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, resulting in a loss on the transaction. If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to factors such as: ##TABLE_START  failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals;  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  IP disputes or other litigation; or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulties obtaining financing for the transaction. ##TABLE_END We are subject to sales-related risks. We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion  of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added resellers, OEMs, Internet service providers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors). Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk, and compliance risks. Distributors may sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position. We face risks related to business transactions with U.S. government entities. We receive proceeds from services and products we provide to the U.S. government. U.S. government demand and payment may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations. U.S. government contracts are subject to oversight, including special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, and security. Failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspensions, or debarment from future U.S. government business. Our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies. The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies have a large impact on our results of operations. For more information, see \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. These methods, estimates, and judgments are subject to large risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and changes could affect our results of operations. Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income. A number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including:  ##TABLE_START  the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the resolution of issues arising from tax audits; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in available tax credits; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-U.S. income and expenses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. ##TABLE_END We may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases. The amount, timing, and other execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes, such as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments, and because of changes in cash flows and changes in tax laws. Workforce restructuring actions may be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our financial results. In response to the business environment and to accomplish our strategic objectives, from time to time we may restructure our operations or make other adjustments to our workforce. Such workforce changes can result in restructuring charges in addition to those described in \" Note 13: Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Such workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity, which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans, or do so within the expected time frame. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls. We do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If our controls become inadequate, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, our reputation may be adversely affected, our business and operating results could be harmed, and the market price of our stock could decline. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

We also completed construction of a large-scale fabrication building in Arizona in 2013, which is currently not in use and is not being depreciated. Incremental construction and equipment installation are required to ready the building for its intended use. We have leveraged existing fabrication facilities, reserving this new building for additional capacity and future technologies. Our Massachusetts fabrication facility is our last manufacturing facility on 200mm wafers and is expected to cease production in Q1 2015. Outside the U.S., we have wafer fabrication facilities in Israel, China, and Ireland. Our fabrication facility in Ireland is currently transitioning to our 14nm process technology, with manufacturing expected to ramp in the second half of 2015. Our assembly and test facilities are located in Malaysia, China, and Vietnam . In addition, we have sales and marketing offices worldwide that are generally located near major concentrations of customers. We believe that the facilities described above are suitable and adequate for our present purposes and that the productive capacity in our facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize it.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES ##TABLE_END Information regarding the principal U.S. market in which Intel common stock is traded, including the market price range of Intel common stock and dividend information, can be found in \"Financial Information by Quarter (Unaudited)\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. As of February 6, 2015 , there were approximately 140,000 registered holders of record of Intels common stock. A substantially greater number of holders of Intel common stock are \"street name\" or beneficial holders, whose shares of record are held by banks, brokers, and other financial institutions. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to  $65 billion in shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. This amount includes an increase of $20 billion in the authorization limit approved by our Board of Directors in July 2014. As of December 27, 2014 , $12.4 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit.

We received collateral from the counterparty for the value attributable to the forward portion of this contract and invested the collateral into permitted investments considered restricted from other uses. As of December 27, 2014, $325 million of collateral, which approximates fair value, remains recorded as both a current asset and current liability on the consolidated balance sheet. The $325 million represents the unsettled portion of the contract and was returned to the counterparty on December 29, 2014, the settlement date. In our consolidated financial statements, we also treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase plan and accordingly are not included in the common stock repurchase totals in the preceding table.

Our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of February 13, 2015 . Overview Our results of operations for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Three Months Ended  Twelve Months Ended (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013  Change  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013  Change Net revenue  $ 14,721  $ 13,834  $  $ 55,870  $ 52,708  $ 3,162 Gross margin  $ 9,621  $ 8,571  $ 1,050  $ 35,609  $ 31,521  $ 4,088 Gross margin percentage  65.4 %  62.0 %  3.4 %  63.7 %  59.8 %  3.9 % Operating income  $ 4,453  $ 3,549  $  $ 15,347  $ 12,291  $ 3,056 Net income  $ 3,661  $ 2,625  $ 1,036  $ 11,704  $ 9,620  $ 2,084 Diluted earnings per share of common stock  $ 0.74  $ 0.51  $ 0.23  $ 2.31  $ 1.89  $ 0.42 ##TABLE_ENDOur results for Q4 2014 were a strong finish to a great year. We achieved record net revenue of $14.7 billion , up  6% from Q4 2013 . We achieved increased net revenue and unit sales growth in the PCCG segment, with net revenue up  3% and operating profit up 18% from Q4 2013 . DCG achieved 25% net revenue growth and 39% operating income growth from Q4 2013 . We saw a moderate increase in net inventory levels from Q3 2014 as we are efficiently managing capacity while ramping our 5th generation Intel Core processor family on 14nm, code-named \"Broadwell.\" The worldwide PC supply chain appears to be healthy, with inventory levels appropriate as we enter Q1 2015 . Gross margin improved by approximately three and a half percentage points from Q4 2013 . The increase from Q4 2013 was primarily due to lower factory start-up costs, lower PCCG and DCG platform (Platform) unit costs, higher Platform average selling prices, and higher Platform unit sales. These items were partially offset by the impact of higher cash consideration associated with our tablet platform and higher production costs on our 14nm products treated as period charges. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) For full year 2014 , we achieved record net revenue of $55.9 billion , up  6% from 2013, operating income of $15.3 billion , up  25% from 2013, and diluted earnings per share of $2.31 , up 22% from 2013. Both our PCCG and DCG businesses outperformed our expectations for the year. PCCG net revenue was up  4% , with PCCG platform unit sales up  8% primarily on higher notebook platform unit sales. We saw robust growth in DCG, with net revenue up  18% and platform average selling prices and unit sales up 10% and 8% , respectively. Gross margin of approximately 64% was up approximately four points from 2013 driven by lower Platform unit costs, lower start-up costs, and higher Platform volumes. These increases were partially offset by higher cost of sales associated with higher tablet platform unit sales and cash consideration provided to our customers associated with integrating our tablet platform. In 2014 , we started growing again across a broad range of products and markets by introducing many new product technologies across all of our businesses. We began shipping the world's first processor on 14nm process technology. Additionally, we launched a new family of processors, Intel Core M. Intel Core M processor is enabling new designs and form factors with its full core performance in both compute and graphics. We recently launched Intel RealSense technology, which includes software and depth cameras that enable more natural and intuitive interaction with personal computing devices. In the wireless business, we qualified our first SoC application processor and baseband 3G solution, code-named \"SoFIA.\" We also exceeded our goal of 40 million tablet platform unit sales in 2014. The cash generation from our business remained strong, with cash from operations of $20.4 billion in 2014 . We ended the year with an investment portfolio of $14.1 billion, down approximately $6.0 billion from a year ago. Our investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets. We purchased $10.1 billion in capital assets, down from our prior outlook of $11.0 billion as we found efficiencies, optimized our manufacturing network, and increased our factory utilization. In addition, we returned $4.4 billion to stockholders through dividends and repurchased $10.8 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. Our Board of Directors authorized an increase of $20 billion to the common stock repurchase program. Effective in Q1 2015, our annual dividend increased to $0.96 per share and our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock. Looking ahead to 2015 , we are forecasting revenue to grow in the mid-single digits and the midpoint of our gross margin range to be at 62% plus or minus a couple of points. Additionally, we are forecasting RD and MGA spending to be approximately $20.0 billion plus or minus $400 million and forecasting capital spending of $10.0 billion plus or minus $500 million. For Q1 2015 , we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range to be $13.7 billion plus or minus $500 million, down approximately 7% from Q4 2014 . This forecast is in line with the average seasonal decline for the first quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be 60% plus or minus a couple of points. Our Business Outlook for Q1 2015 and full year 2015 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (RD plus MGA), and capital expenditures. We publish our Business Outlook in our quarterly earnings release. Our Business Outlook and any updates thereto are publicly available on our Investor Relations website, www.intc.com . This Business Outlook is not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the Business Outlook or in this Form 10-K.

The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Critical Accounting Estimates The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: ##TABLE_START  the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity investments, net when we record impairments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment; goodwill; and identified intangibles), which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment. ##TABLE_END In the following section, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. Non-Marketable Equity Investments We regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $3.2 billion as of December 27, 2014 ( $2.3 billion as of December 28, 2013 ). Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. Our non-marketable equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success depends on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business factors. The companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings. These events could cause our investments to become impaired. In addition, financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. For further information about our investment portfolio risks, see \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized. The measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment. Qualitative analysis of our investments involves understanding our investees revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects, the technological feasibility of our investees products and technologies, the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area including adverse regulatory or economic changes, and the management and governance structure of the investee. Quantitative assessments of the fair value of our investments are developed using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as revenue, earnings, comparable performance multiples, recent financing rounds, the terms of the investees issued interests, and the level of marketability of the investments. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies sizes, growth rates, industries, and development stages. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates regarding the investees' revenue, costs, and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available market, historical, and forecast data. If the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment. Impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $140 million in 2014 ( $112 million in 2013 and $104 million in 2012 ). MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Long-Lived Assets Property, Plant and Equipment We assess property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset groupings carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. We measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset groupings carrying value and its fair value. Property, plant and equipment is considered a non-financial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. Impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets new, shorter useful lives. Based on our analysis, impairments and accelerated depreciation of our property, plant and equipment was $115 million in 2014 ( $172 million in 2013 and $73 million in 2012 ). Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in \" Note 26: Operating Segments and Geographic Information \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist , to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value. For reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. Additionally, as part of this assessment, we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting units fair value. For reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform additional analysis. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. If we determine during the second step that the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income method and the market method to estimate a reporting units fair value. The income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following assumptions and inputs: revenue, based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share; estimated costs; and appropriate discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. Our estimates of market segment growth, our market segment share, and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and a variety of external sources. These estimates are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process. The same estimates are also used in planning for our long-term manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process, and for long-term and short-term business planning and forecasting. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data. The market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. A reporting units carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. For the annual impairment assessment in 2014 , we determined that for each of our reporting units, it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value. As a result, we concluded that performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary for any reporting unit. During the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years, we have completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years. Identified Intangibles We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinite-lived intangible assets, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If we determine that an individual asset is impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Based on our impairment assessment, we recognized impairment charges of $36 million in 2014 ( $17 million in 2013 and $21 million in 2012 ). Income Taxes We must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not more likely than not, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should a change occur in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery is not more likely than not. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. We have not recognized U.S. deferred income taxes on certain undistributed non-U.S. earnings because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. Remittances of non-U.S. earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our non-U.S. and U.S. operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in the various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-U.S. earnings, which would be subject to U.S. income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes. Inventory Intel has a product development lifecycle that corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities, and associated costs, change in nature from RD to cost of sales. In order for a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. This milestone is known as product release qualification (PRQ). We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. To determine which costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; therefore, it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges were zero in 2014 ( $319 million in 2013 and $540 million in 2012 ). Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, customer acceptance of our products, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. If the estimated market value of the inventory is less than the carrying value, we write down the inventory and record the difference as a charge to cost of sales. Inventory reserves increased by approximately $290 million in 2014 compared to 2013 . This increase was driven primarily by higher production costs on 14nm treated as period charges and pre-qualification product costs. These increases were partially offset by the sell-through of written-down inventory and previously non-qualified units. The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The demand forecast is utilized in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. The estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Loss Contingencies We are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings and asserted and potential claims, accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred. The outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims, and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments, are subject to significant uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter, and we may revise our estimates. These revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

Our overall gross margin dollars for 2013  decreased by $1.6 billion , or 5% , compared to 2012 . The decrease was due in large part to $1.8 billion of higher factory start-up costs, primarily for our next-generation 14nm process technology. To a lesser extent, lower MCG phone components revenue and lower netbook platform revenue contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by approximately $320 million of lower PCCG and DCG platform unit costs and $220 million of lower excess capacity charges. Our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 59.8% in 2013 from 62.1% in 2012 . The decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin percentage decrease in PCCG.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. Beginning in Q3 2013 , management approved several restructuring actions, including targeted workforce reductions and the exit of certain businesses and facilities. These actions include the wind down of our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Massachusetts, which we expect to cease production in Q1 2015 , and the closure of our assembly and test facility in Costa Rica, which ceased production in Q4 2014 . These targeted reductions will enable the company to better align our resources in areas providing the greatest benefit in the current business environment. We expect these actions to be substantially complete by the end of  2015 . Restructuring and asset impairment charges for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)    Employee severance and benefit arrangements  $  $  $  Asset impairments and other restructuring charges     Total restructuring and asset impairment charges  $  $  $  ##TABLE_ENDRestructuring and asset impairment activity for each period was as follows:  ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  Employee Severance and Benefits  Asset Impairments and Other  Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 29, 2012  $   $   $  Additional accruals    Adjustments     Cash payments  (18 )    (18 ) Non-cash settlements    (39 )  (39 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 28, 2013     Additional accruals    Adjustments   (1 )  Cash payments  (327 )  (6 )  (333 ) Non-cash settlements    (13 )  (13 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2014  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDWe recorded the additional accruals and adjustments as restructuring and asset impairment charges in the consolidated statements of income and within the \"all other\" operating segments category.

Restructuring actions that were approved in  2014 impacted approximately 3,700 employees. Since Q3 2013 , we have incurred a total of $535 million in restructuring and asset impairment charges. These charges included a total of $466 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 7,600 employees, and $69 million in asset impairment charges and other restructuring charges.  We estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately $600 million , which will be realized within RD, cost of sales, and MGA. We began to realize these savings in Q4 2013 and expect to fully realize these savings beginning in Q2 2015. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation totaled $1.1 billion in 2014 ( $1.1 billion in 2013 and $1.1 billion in 2012 ).

The majority of gains on sales, net for 2014 resulted from gains on private equity sales. We recognized higher net gains on equity investments in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher gains on sales of equity investments, partially offset by lower gains on third-party merger transactions. Net gains on equity investments for 2013 included gains of $439 million on the sales of our interest in Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC) and our shares in Clearwire Corporation in Q3 2013. For further information on these transactions, see \" Note 5: Cash and Investments \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We recognized an interest and other net gain in 2014 compared to a net loss in 2013 due to a gain recognized on the divestiture of our Intel Media assets in 2014. For further information, see \" Note 9: Divestitures \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We recognized an interest and other net loss in 2013 compared to a net gain in 2012. We recognized a net loss in 2013 due to an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of our $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in Q4 2012. Additionally, in Q2 2012 we received proceeds from an insurance claim related to the floods in Thailand. Provision for Taxes Our provision for taxes and effective tax rate for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)    Income before taxes  $ 15,801  $ 12,611  $ 14,873 Provision for taxes  $ 4,097  $ 2,991  $ 3,868 Effective tax rate  25.9 %  23.7 %  26.0 % ##TABLE_ENDThe U.S. RD tax credit was reenacted in Q4 2014 retroactive for the full year. It was also reenacted in Q1 2013 retroactive to the beginning of 2012. A substantial majority of the increase in our effective tax rate between 2014 and 2013 was driven by the reenacted U.S. RD tax credit in 2013 containing two years' worth of RD tax credits. The majority of the decrease in our effective tax rate between 2013 and 2012 was driven by the recognition of the 2012 U.S. RD tax credit in Q1 2013. This was partially offset by a lower percentage of our profits generated in lower tax jurisdictions in 2013 compared to 2012.

For 2014 compared to 2013 , the $358 million  decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital, partially offset by higher net income and adjustments for non-cash items. The adjustments for non-cash items were higher due primarily to higher depreciation in 2014 compared to 2013. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2014 compared to 2013 were $1.8 billion  higher due to higher income before taxes in 2014 and 2012 income tax overpayments, which reduced income taxes paid in 2013. Changes in assets and liabilities as of December 27, 2014 , compared to December 28, 2013 , included an income taxes net receivable resulting from income tax settlement payments in 2014 and higher accounts receivable resulting from a higher portion of sales at the end of Q4 2014. For 2014 , our three largest customers accounted for 46% of our net revenue ( 44% in 2013 and 43% in 2012 ), with HP accounting for 18% of our net revenue ( 17% in 2013 and 18% in 2012 ), Dell accounting for 16% of our net revenue ( 15% in 2013 and 14% in 2012 ), and Lenovo accounting for 12% of our net revenue ( 12% in 2013 and 11% in 2012 ). These three customers accounted for 43% of our accounts receivable as of December 27, 2014 ( 34% as of December 28, 2013 ). For 2013 compared to 2012 , the $1.9 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital, partially offset by lower net income in 2013. Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; as well as proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions. The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets,higher maturities, and sales of our available-for-sale investments. This activity was partially offset by an increase in investments in non-marketable equity investments and lower maturities and sales of trading assets. Our capital expenditures were $10.1 billion in 2014 ( $10.7 billion in 2013 and $11.0 billion in 2012 ). Cash used for investing activities increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in purchases of available-for-sale investments and a decrease in maturities and sales of trading assets, partially offset by an increase in maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments and a decrease in purchases of licensed technology and patents. Net purchases of available-for-sale investments in 2012 included our purchase of $3.2 billion of equity securities in ASML in Q3 2012. Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of common stock through employee equity incentive plans. The increase in cash used for financing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program partially offset by the issuance of short-term debt in 2014. We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to  $65 billion in shares of our common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions. This amount includes an increase of $20 billion in the authorization limit approved by our Board of Directors in July 2014. During 2014 , we repurchased $10.8 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program compared to $2.1 billion in 2013 . As of December 27, 2014 , $12.4 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of common stock through employee equity incentive plans totaled $1.7 billion in 2014 compared to $1.6 billion in 2013 . Our total dividend payments were $4.4 billion in 2014 compared to $4.5 billion in 2013 . We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 89 quarters. In January 2015 , our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock for Q1 2015 . The dividend is payable on March 1, 2015 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2015 . MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The increase in cash used for financing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2012 and fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program in 2013. Liquidity Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. As of December 27, 2014 , cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets totaled $14.1 billion ( $20.1 billion as of December 28, 2013 ). In addition to the $14.1 billion , we have $2.0 billion of other long-term investments, $1.3 billion of loans receivable and other, and $450 million of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity. Most of our investments in debt instruments are in A/A2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated AA-/Aa3 or better . Another potential source of liquidity is an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion . This ongoing authorization includes borrowings under our commercial paper program. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program were $2.4 billion during 2014 , and $ 500 million of commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 27, 2014 . Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard  Poors and P-1 by Moodys as of December 27, 2014 . We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. In 2012, we utilized this shelf registration statement and issued $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale of these notes were used for general corporate purposes and to repurchase common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock repurchase program. For further information on the terms of the notes, see \" Note 15: Borrowings \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. As of December 27, 2014 , $12.0 billion of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Of the $12.0 billion held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, approximately $2.3 billion was available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of December 27, 2014 . The remaining amount of non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no U.S. current or deferred taxes have been accrued and this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the U.S. and future acquisitions of non-U.S. entities. We believe our U.S. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the U.S., and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., such amounts would be subject to U.S. income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes. We believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, working capital requirements, dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Fair Value of Financial Instruments When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligors credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. For further information, see \"Fair Value\" in \" Note 2: Accounting Policies \" and \" Note 4: Fair Value \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Marketable Debt Instruments As of December 27, 2014 , our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $15.0 billion of marketable debt instruments. Of these instruments, $6.9 billion was classified as Level 1, $8.0 billion as Level 2, and $106 million as Level 3. Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 were classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active. Of the $8.0 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2, approximately 40% was classified as Level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model performed by us and approximately 60% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data. Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Loans Receivable and Reverse Repurchase Agreements As of December 27, 2014 , our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $721 million of loans receivable and $268 million of reverse repurchase agreements. All of these investments were classified as Level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Marketable Equity Securities As of December 27, 2014 , our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $7.1 billion of marketable equity securities. All of these securities were classified as Level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations Significant contractual obligations as of December 27, 2014 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Payments Due by Period (In Millions)  Total  Less Than 1 Year  13 Years  35 Years  More Than 5 Years Operating lease obligations  $ 1,070  $  $  $  $ Capital purchase obligations 1  3,482  3,317      Other purchase obligations and commitments 2  2,500  1,390  1,027    Long-term debt obligations 3  21,942   5,330   15,462 Other long-term liabilities 4, 5  1,437     Total 6  $ 30,431  $ 6,122  $ 7,269  $ 1,150  $ 15,890 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 27, 2014 , as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2  Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include agreements to fund various projects with other companies.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Debt obligations are classified based on their stated maturity date, regardless of their classification on the consolidated balance sheet s. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $262 million of long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the preceding table. However, long-term income taxes payable, recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non-U.S. income taxes. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 5  Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Expected required contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $69 million to be made during 2015 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2015 are not practicable to estimate. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 6  Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. ##TABLE_END The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services, included in other purchase obligations and commitments in the preceding table, include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements have been excluded from the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table. These obligations include milestone-based co-marketing agreements, contingent funding or payment obligations, and milestone-based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party. As of December 27, 2014 , assuming that all future milestones are met, excluding the ASML milestones subsequently mentioned, the additional required payments would be approximately $450 million . During 2012, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML intended to accelerate the development of EUV lithography, certain of which were amended in 2014. Under the amended agreements Intel agreed to provide RD funding totaling  829 million  over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from ASML. Our remaining obligation, contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, is approximately 562 million , or $689 million , as of December 27, 2014 . As our obligation is contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, we have excluded this obligation from the preceding table. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest. During 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. (Tsinghua Unigroup), an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co. Ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop Intel architecture- and communications-based solutions for smartphones. Subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, we have also agreed to invest up to RMB 9.0 billion (approximately $1.5 billion as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately 20% of the holding company under Tsinghua Unigroup, which will own Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics. As our obligation is contingent upon regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, it has been excluded from the preceding table. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements As of December 27, 2014 , we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END We are affected by changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 27, 2014 , and December 28, 2013 . Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange Rates In general, we economically hedge currency risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding gains and losses on the related hedging instruments. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, the Chinese yuan, and the Israeli shekel . We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in the fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs. These programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements . For further information, see \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $50 million as of December 27, 2014 (less than $40 million as of December 28, 2013 ). Interest Rates We generally hedge interest rate risks of fixed-rate debt instruments with interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments. We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and indebtedness. Our indebtedness includes our debt issuances and the liability associated with a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA Corporation. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately $1.0 billion as of December 27, 2014 (an increase of approximately $1.1 billion as of December 28, 2013 ). A hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 1.0% , after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $10 million as of December 27, 2014 (an increase of approximately $10 million as of December 28, 2013 ). The fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in the fair value of our net investment position. For further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, see \" Note 4: Fair Value \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Equity Prices Our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities at the inception of our investments. Before we enter into hedge arrangements, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors, as well as the expected timing of disposal, to determine whether hedging is appropriate. Our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives. We also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses and gains on the related liabilities . As of December 27, 2014 , the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $7.1 billion ( $6.3 billion as of December 28, 2013 ). Substantially all of our marketable equity investments portfolio as of December 27, 2014 was concentrated in our investment in ASML of $6.9 billion ( $5.9 billion as of December 28, 2013 ). Our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed necessary. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a decline of 30% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $2.1 billion , based on the value as of December 27, 2014 (a decrease in value of approximately $1.6 billion , based on the value as of December 28, 2013 using an assumed decline of 25% ). Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity investments, excluding investments accounted for under the equity method, had a carrying amount of $1.8 billion as of December 27, 2014 ( $1.3 billion as of December 28, 2013 ). The carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $1.4 billion as of December 27, 2014 ( $1.0 billion as of December 28, 2013 ). The majority of our non-marketable equity method investments balance as of December 27, 2014 was concentrated in our IMFT and Cloudera (which was purchased during 2014 ) investments of $713 million and $280 million , respectively ( $646 million for IMFT as of December 28, 2013 ). Commodity Price Risk Although we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not materially affected by commodity price risk. We have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in the fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place for our key commodities that mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration. For further information on commodity price risk, see \" Note 6: Derivative Financial Instruments \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Part IV, Item 15. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Intel Corporation at December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 27, 2014 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Intel Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 27, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( 2013 framework ) and our report dated February 13, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP San Jose, California February 13, 2015  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intel Corporation We have audited Intel Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 27, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( 2013 framework ) (the COSO criteria). Intel Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Intel Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 27, 2014 , based on the COSO criteria.

INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Note 1: Basis of Presentation  We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 were all 52-week years. The next 53-week year will end on December 31, 2016. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Intel Corporation and our subsidiaries. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We use the equity method to account for equity investments in instances in which we own common stock or similar interests and have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation. Note 2: Accounting Policies  Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The accounting estimates that require our most significant, difficult, and subjective judgments include: ##TABLE_START  the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment; goodwill; and identified intangibles); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the valuation of inventory; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies. ##TABLE_END The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. Fair Value Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value, except for cost method investments, cost method loans receivable, equity method investments, grants receivable, and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months. Substantially all of our liabilities are not measured and recorded at fair value. Fair Value Hierarchy The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data. For further discussion of fair value, see \" Note 4: Fair Value \" and \" Note 16: Retirement Benefit Plans .\" INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of approximately three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can include investments such as corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and reverse repurchase agreements classified as cash equivalents. See \" Note 4: Fair Value \" for the instruments held as cash equivalents. Trading Assets Marketable debt instruments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument, or when the marketable debt instrument itself is used to economically hedge foreign exchange rate risk from remeasurement. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. The gains or losses of these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net. We also designate certain floating-rate securitized financial instruments, primarily asset-backed securities, as trading assets. Available-for-Sale Investments We consider all liquid available-for-sale debt instruments with original maturities from the date of purchase of approximately three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Available-for-sale debt instruments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Available-for-sale debt instruments with remaining maturities beyond one year are classified as other long-term investments. Investments that we designate as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except as noted in the \"Other-Than-Temporary Impairment\" section that follows. We determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level. Our available-for-sale investments include: ##TABLE_START  Marketable debt instruments when the interest rate and foreign currency risks are not hedged at the inception of the investment or when our criteria for designation as trading assets are not met. We generally hold these debt instruments to generate a return commensurate with the U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR. We record the interest income and realized gains and losses on the sale of these instruments in interest and other, net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketable equity securities when there is no plan to sell or hedge the investment at the time of original classification. We acquire these equity investments to promote business and strategic objectives. To the extent that these investments continue to have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks through hedging activities. We record the realized gains or losses on the sale or exchange of marketable equity securities in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END Non-Marketable and Other Equity Investments Our non-marketable equity and other equity investments are included in other long-term assets. We account for non-marketable equity and other equity investments for which we do not have control over the investee as: ##TABLE_START  Equity method investments when we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Equity method investments include marketable and non-marketable investments. Our proportionate share of the income or loss is recognized on a one-quarter lag and is recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-marketable cost method investments when the equity method does not apply. ##TABLE_END We record the realized gains or losses on the sale of equity method and non-marketable cost method investments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Our available-for-sale investments and non-marketable and other equity investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. Investments are considered impaired when the fair value is below the investments adjusted cost basis. Impairments affect earnings as follows: ##TABLE_START  Marketable debt instruments when the fair value is below amortized cost and we intend to sell the instrument, or when it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument (that is, a credit loss exists). When we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument, we separate other-than-temporary impairments into amounts representing credit losses, which are recognized in interest and other, net, and amounts related to all other factors, which are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketable equity securities based on the specific facts and circumstances present at the time of assessment, which include the consideration of general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is below cost, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of value in the foreseeable future. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and the business outlook for, the investee, which may include industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and changes in the investees credit rating. We record other-than-temporary impairments on marketable equity securities and marketable equity method investments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-marketable equity investments based on our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment, and qualitative and quantitative analysis, including: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the investees revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the technological feasibility of the investees products and technologies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the management and governance structure of the investee; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  factors related to the investees ability to remain in business, such as the investees liquidity and debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. ##TABLE_END We record other-than-temporary impairments for non-marketable cost method investments and equity method investments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Derivative Financial Instruments Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk, commodity price risk, and credit risk.  When possible, we enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. Generally, our master netting agreements allow for net settlement in case of certain triggering events such as bankruptcy or default of one of the counterparties to the transaction. We may also elect to exchange cash collateral with certain of our counterparties on a regular basis. For presentation on our consolidated balance sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. Our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for designation as a cash flow hedge. A designated hedge with exposure to variability in the functional currency equivalent of the future foreign currency cash flows of a forecasted transaction is one example of a cash flow hedge. The criteria for designating a derivative as a cash flow hedge include the assessment of the instruments effectiveness in risk reduction, matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction, and the assessment of the probability that the underlying transaction will occur. For derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction. Derivatives that we designate as cash flow hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from operating activities. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) We recognize gains and losses from changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes in the line item on the consolidated statements of income most closely associated with the related exposures, primarily in interest and other, net and gains (losses) on equity investments, net. As part of our strategic investment program, we also acquire equity derivative instruments, such as equity conversion rights associated with debt instruments, that we do not designate as hedging instruments. We recognize the gains or losses from changes in fair value of these equity derivative instruments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Realized gains and losses from derivatives not designated as hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within cash flows from operating activities or investing activities, depending on the activity the exposure is most closely associated with. Measurement of Effectiveness ##TABLE_START  Effectiveness for forwards is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the fair value of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item. For currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to capital purchases, forward points are excluded, and effectiveness is measured using spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item. For currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to operating expenditures, forward points are included, and effectiveness is measured using forward rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Effectiveness for options is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of an option instrument representing the hedged risks in the hedged item. Time value is excluded and effectiveness is measured using spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Effectiveness for interest rate swaps and commodity swaps is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the swap with the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item. ##TABLE_END If a cash flow hedge is discontinued because it is probable that the original hedged transaction will not occur as previously anticipated, the cumulative unrealized gain or loss on the related derivative is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. Subsequent gains or losses on the related derivative instrument are recognized in interest and other, net in each period until the instrument matures, is terminated, is re-designated as a qualified cash flow hedge, or is sold. Ineffective portions of cash flow hedges, as well as amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, are recognized in earnings in interest and other, net. For further discussion of our derivative instruments and risk management programs, see \" Note 6: Derivative Financial Instruments .\" Securities Lending We may enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions, generally to facilitate hedging and certain investment and financing transactions. Selected securities may be loaned, secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investment assets on our consolidated balance sheets. For lending agreements collateralized by cash and cash equivalents, collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. For lending agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the collateral as an asset or a liability, unless the collateral is repledged. Loans Receivable We make loans to third parties that are classified within other current assets or other long-term assets. We may elect the fair value option for loans when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. We record the gains or losses on these loans arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate, currency, and counterparty credit changes, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments, in interest and other, net. Loans that are denominated in U.S. dollars and have a floating-rate coupon are carried at amortized cost. We measure interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method, which is based on the effective yield of the loans rather than the stated coupon rate. For further discussion of our loans receivable, see \" Note 4: Fair Value .\" INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Inventories We compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory beginning in the quarter in which a product meets the technical criteria to qualify for sale to customers. Prior to qualification for sale, costs that do not meet the criteria for research and development (RD) are included in cost of sales in the period incurred. Inventories at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013 Raw materials  $  $ Work in process  2,375  1,998 Finished goods  1,436  1,716 Total inventories  $ 4,273  $ 4,172 ##TABLE_ENDProperty, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, net at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013 Land and buildings  $ 22,989  $ 21,098 Machinery and equipment  44,441  40,540 Construction in progress  12,279  11,778 Total property, plant and equipment, gross  79,709  73,416 Less: accumulated depreciation  (46,471 )  (41,988 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net  $ 33,238  $ 31,428 ##TABLE_ENDWe compute depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method. Substantially all of our depreciable property, plant and equipment assets are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment, 2 to 4 years; buildings, 10 to 25 years. We capitalize a majority of interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment. Goodwill We record goodwill when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. We assign the goodwill to our reporting units based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist , which includes evaluating qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment of a reporting units goodwill. We perform impairment tests using a fair value approach when necessary. The reporting units carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. For further discussion of goodwill, see \" Note 10: Goodwill .\" Identified Intangible Assets Licensed technology and patents are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods of benefit. We amortize all acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life based on economic benefit. Acquisition-related in-process RD assets represent the fair value of incomplete RD projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition; initially, these are classified as \"other intangible assets\" that are not subject to amortization. Assets related to projects that have been completed are transferred from \"other intangible assets\" to \"acquisition-related developed technology;\" these are subject to amortization, while assets related to projects that have been abandoned are impaired and expensed to RD. In the quarter following the period in which identified intangible assets become fully amortized, we remove the fully amortized balances from the gross asset and accumulated amortization amounts. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The estimated useful life ranges for substantially all identified intangible assets that are subject to amortization as of December 27, 2014 were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Years)  Estimated Useful Life Acquisition-related developed technology   Acquisition-related customer relationships   Acquisition-related trade names   Licensed technology and patents   ##TABLE_ENDWe perform a quarterly review of finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess recoverability by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If an assets useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinite-lived intangible assets, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If necessary, a quantitative impairment test is performed to compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying value. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. For further discussion of identified intangible assets, see \" Note 11: Identified Intangible Assets .\" Product Warranty The vast majority of our products are sold with a limited warranty on product quality and a limited indemnification for customers against intellectual property rights infringement claims related to our products. The accrual and the related expense for known product warranty issues were not significant during the periods presented. Due to product testing, the short time typically between product shipment and the detection and correction of product failures, and the historical rate of payments on indemnification claims, the accrual and related expense for estimated incurred but unidentified issues were not significant during the periods presented. Revenue Recognition We recognize net product revenue when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, delivery has occurred, and acceptance, if applicable, as well as fixed pricing and probable collectibility. We record pricing allowances, including discounts based on contractual arrangements with customers, when we recognize revenue as a reduction to both accounts receivable and net revenue. Because of frequent sales price reductions and rapid technology obsolescence in the industry, we defer product revenue and related costs of sales from component sales made to distributors under agreements allowing price protection or right of return until the distributors sell the merchandise. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. We include shipping charges billed to customers in net revenue, and include the related shipping costs in cost of sales. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Revenue from license agreements with our McAfee, Inc. (McAfee) business generally includes service and support agreements for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period. Revenue derived from online subscription products is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period. Professional services revenue is recognized as services are performed or, if required, upon customer acceptance. For arrangements with multiple elements, including software licenses, maintenance, and/or services, revenue is allocated across the separately identified deliverables and may be recognized or deferred. When vendor-specific objective evidence does not exist for undelivered elements such as maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Direct costs, such as costs related to revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements associated with license arrangements, as well as component costs associated with product revenue and sales commissions, are deferred and amortized over the same period that the related revenue is recognized. We record deferred revenue offset by the related cost of sales on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred income. Advertising Cooperative advertising programs reimburse customers for marketing activities for certain of our products, subject to defined criteria. We accrue cooperative advertising obligations and record the costs at the same time that the related revenue is recognized. We record cooperative advertising costs as marketing, general and administrative (MGA) expenses to the extent that an advertising benefit separate from the revenue transaction can be identified and the fair value of that advertising benefit received is determinable. We record any excess in cash paid to customers over the fair value of the advertising benefit we receive as a reduction in revenue. Advertising costs, including direct marketing costs, recorded within MGA expenses were $1.8 billion in 2014 ( $1.9 billion in 2013 and $2.0 billion in 2012 ). Employee Equity Incentive Plans We have employee equity incentive plans, which are described more fully in \" Note 18: Employee Equity Incentive Plans .\" We use the straight-line attribution method to recognize share-based compensation over the service period of the award. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock units, we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and restricted stock units with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award. Income Taxes We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that it is believed more likely than not to be realized. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if that tax position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We then measure the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of income. For more information about income taxes, see \" Note 23: Income Taxes .\" Note 3: Recent Accounting Standards  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard to achieve a consistent application of revenue recognition within the U.S., resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by reporting companies under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Under the new model, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2017; early adoption is prohibited. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 4: Fair Value Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 27, 2014  December 28, 2013   Fair Value Measured and Recorded at Reporting Date Using  Total  Fair Value Measured and Recorded at Reporting Date Using  Total (In Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Assets                 Cash equivalents:                 Corporate debt  $   $  $   $  $  $ 1,920  $   $ 2,074 Financial institution instruments   1,119    1,440   1,190    2,077 Government debt               Reverse repurchase agreements             Short-term investments:                 Corporate debt       1,374   1,667 Financial institution instruments   1,050    1,199   2,895    3,089 Government debt        1,033    1,216 Trading assets:                 Asset-backed securities           Corporate debt  2,625     2,964  2,161     2,789 Financial institution instruments  1,146     1,759  1,188     1,606 Government debt  1,295  2,221    3,516  1,625  1,733    3,358 Other current assets:                 Derivative assets           Loans receivable             Marketable equity securities  7,097      7,097  6,221      6,221 Other long-term investments:                 Asset-backed securities            Corporate debt     1,194     Financial institution instruments           Government debt           Other long-term assets:                 Derivative assets           Loans receivable             Total assets measured and recorded at fair value  13,965  9,613   23,708  13,512  14,525   28,125 Liabilities                 Other accrued liabilities:                 Derivative liabilities             Other long-term liabilities:                 Derivative liabilities             Total liabilities measured and recorded at fair value  $   $  $   $  $   $  $   $ ##TABLE_ENDGovernment debt includes instruments such as non-U.S. government securities and U.S. agency securities.  Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed and floating rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the year ended December 27, 2014 we transferred corporate debt, financial institution instruments, and government debt of approximately $177 million from Level 1 to Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and approximately $395 million from Level 2 to Level 1. These transfers were primarily based on changes in market activity for the underlying securities. Our policy is to reflect transfers between the fair value hierarchy levels at the beginning of the quarter in which a change in circumstances resulted in the transfer. Investments in Debt Instruments Debt instruments reflected in the preceding table include investments such as asset-backed securities, corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and reverse repurchase agreements classified as cash equivalents . We classify our debt instruments as Level 2 when we use observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets. When observable market prices for identical securities are not available, we price the debt instruments using our own models, such as a discounted cash flow model, or non-binding market consensus prices based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers. We corroborate non-binding market consensus prices with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exists, quoted market prices for similar instruments, or pricing models such as a discounted cash flow model. These valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding and binding broker quotes; observable market prices for identical or similar instruments; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and unobservable market inputs that we consider to be not significant. The discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs, such as LIBOR-based yield curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings. All significant inputs are derived from or corroborated with observable market data. The fair values of debt instruments classified as Level 3 are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.  Fair Value Option for Loans Receivable We elected the fair value option for loans receivable when the interest rate or currency exchange rate risk was hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. As of December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 , the fair value of our loans receivable for which we elected the fair value option did not significantly differ from the contractual principal balance based on the contractual currency. Loans receivable are classified within other current assets and other long-term assets. Fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Gains and losses from changes in fair value on the loans receivable and related derivative instruments, as well as interest income, are recorded in interest and other, net. During all periods presented, changes in the fair value of our loans receivable were largely offset by changes in the related derivative instruments, resulting in an insignificant net impact on our consolidated statements of income. Gains and losses attributable to changes in credit risk are determined using observable credit default spreads for the issuer or comparable companies; these gains and losses were insignificant during all periods presented. We did not elect the fair value option for loans receivable when the interest rate or currency exchange rate risk was not hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. Loans receivable not measured and recorded at fair value are included in the following \"Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\" section. Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis Our non-marketable equity investments, marketable equity method investments, and non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized. Some of our non-marketable equity investments have been measured and recorded at fair value due to events or circumstances that significantly impacted the fair value of those investments, resulting in other-than-temporary impairments. We classified these investments as Level 3 because the valuations used unobservable inputs that were significant to the fair value measurements and required management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices. Impairments recognized on non-marketable equity investments held as of December 27, 2014 were $128 million in 2014 ( $106 million in 2013 on non-marketable equity investments held as of December 28, 2013 and $68 million in 2012 on non-marketable equity investments held as of December 29, 2012 ). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis On a quarterly basis, we measure the fair value of our grants receivable, cost method loans receivable, non-marketable cost method investments, reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months, and indebtedness carried at amortized cost; however, the assets are recorded at fair value only when an impairment is recognized. The carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START    December 27, 2014    Carrying Amount  Fair Value Measured Using  Fair Value (In Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Grants receivable  $  $   $  $   $ Loans receivable  $  $   $  $   $ Non-marketable cost method investments  $ 1,769  $   $   $ 2,599  $ 2,599 Reverse repurchase agreements  $  $   $  $   $ Short-term debt  $ 1,588  $   $ 2,145  $   $ 2,145 Long-term debt  $ 12,107  $ 11,467  $ 1,309  $   $ 12,776 NVIDIA Corporation cross-license agreement liability  $  $   $  $   $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START    December 28, 2013    Carrying Amount  Fair Value Measured Using  Fair Value (In Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Grants receivable  $  $   $  $   $ Loans receivable  $  $   $  $  $ Non-marketable cost method investments  $ 1,270  $   $   $ 2,105  $ 2,105 Reverse repurchase agreements  $  $   $  $   $ Short-term debt  $  $   $  $   $ Long-term debt  $ 13,165  $ 10,937  $ 2,601  $   $ 13,538 NVIDIA Corporation cross-license agreement liability  $  $   $  $   $ ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of our grants receivable is determined using a discounted cash flow model, which discounts future cash flows using an appropriate yield curve. As of December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 , the carrying amount of our grants receivable was classified within other current assets and other long-term assets, as applicable. The carrying amount and fair value of loans receivable exclude loans measured and recorded at a fair value of $721 million as of December 27, 2014 ( $805 million as of December 28, 2013 ). The fair value of our loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreements, including those held at fair value, is determined using a discounted cash flow model. All significant inputs in the models are derived from or corroborated with observable market data, such as LIBOR-based yield curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings. The credit quality of these assets remains high, with credit ratings of A+/A1 or better for the substantial majority of our loans receivable and the majority of our reverse repurchase agreements as of December 27, 2014 . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) As of December 27, 2014 , and December 28, 2013 , the unrealized loss position of our non-marketable cost method investments was insignificant. Our non-marketable cost method investments are valued using a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment. Qualitative analysis of our investments involves understanding our investees revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects; the technological feasibility of our investees products and technologies; the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; and the management and governance structure of the investee. Quantitative assessments of the fair value of our investments are developed using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as revenue, earnings, comparable performance multiples, recent financing rounds, the terms of the investees issued interests, and the level of marketability of the investments. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies sizes, growth rates, industries, and development stages. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates regarding investees revenue, costs, and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available market, historical, and forecast data. The carrying amount and fair value of short-term debt exclude drafts payable. Our short-term debt recognized at amortized cost includes our 2009 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2039 (2009 debentures) and our commercial paper outstanding as of December 27, 2014 . During the first quarter of 2015, holders may, at their option, surrender the 2009 debentures for conversion. For further information, see \" Note 15: Borrowings .\" Our long-term debt recognized at amortized cost is comprised of our senior notes and our convertible debentures. The fair value of our senior notes is determined using active market prices, and is therefore classified as Level 1. The fair value of our 2009 and 2005 convertible debentures is determined using discounted cash flow models with observable market inputs, and takes into consideration variables such as interest rate changes, comparable instruments, subordination discount, and credit-rating changes, and is therefore classified as Level 2. The NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA) cross-license agreement liability in the preceding table was incurred as a result of entering into a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA in January 2011, pursuant to which we agreed to make payments to NVIDIA over six years. As of December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 , the carrying amount of the liability arising from the agreement was classified within other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, based on the expected timing of the underlying payments ( $200 million in each of January 2015 and 2016 treated as cash used for financing activities). The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model, which discounts future cash flows using our incremental borrowing rates. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 5: Cash and Investments  Cash and investments at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013 Available-for-sale investments  $ 13,038  $ 18,086 Cash   Equity method investments  1,446  1,038 Loans receivable   1,072 Non-marketable cost method investments  1,769  1,270 Reverse repurchase agreements   Trading assets  9,063  8,441 Total cash and investments  $ 27,810  $ 31,561 ##TABLE_ENDAvailable-for-Sale Investments Available-for-sale investments at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 27, 2014  December 28, 2013 (In Millions)  Adjusted Cost  Gross Unrealized Gains  Gross Unrealized Losses  Fair Value  Adjusted Cost  Gross Unrealized Gains  Gross Unrealized Losses  Fair Value Asset-backed securities  $  $   $ (2 )  $  $  $   $ (2 )  $ Corporate debt  2,040   (5 )  2,048  4,254   (3 )  4,266 Financial institution instruments  3,146   (1 )  3,147  5,654   (1 )  5,658 Government debt     (1 )   1,932   (1 )  1,932 Marketable equity securities  3,318  3,779    7,097  3,340  2,881    6,221 Total available-for-sale investments  $ 9,253  $ 3,794  $ (9 )  $ 13,038  $ 15,191  $ 2,902  $ (7 )  $ 18,086 ##TABLE_ENDGovernment debt includes instruments such as non-U.S. government securities and U.S. agency securities.  Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed and floating rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. Time deposits were primarily issued by institutions outside the U.S. as of December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 . During 2014 , we sold available-for-sale investments for proceeds of $1.7 billion , of which $509 million related to sales of cash and cash equivalents ( $1.3 billion in 2013 , of which $339 million related to sales of cash and cash equivalents; and $3.4 billion in 2012 , of which $1.1 billion related to sales of cash and cash equivalents). The gross realized gains on sales of available-for-sale investments were $136 million in 2014 ( $146 million in 2013 and $166 million in 2012 ). We determine the cost of an investment sold on an average cost basis at the individual security level. Impairments recognized on available-for-sale investments were $5 million in 2014 ( $14 million in 2013 and $36 million in 2012 ). During 2012, we purchased ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) equity securities totaling $3.2 billion . This equity interest has been accounted for as an available-for-sale investment and is included as marketable equity securities in the preceding table. For information on the unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into the consolidated statements of income, see \" Note 24: Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) .\" INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale debt investments, by contractual maturity, as of December 27, 2014 were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  Cost  Fair Value Due in 1 year or less  $ 3,490  $ 3,500 Due in 12 years  1,003  1,004 Due in 25 years   Instruments not due at a single maturity date   Total  $ 5,935  $ 5,941 ##TABLE_ENDEquity Method Investments Equity method investments, classified within other long-term assets, at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START    December 27, 2014  December 28, 2013 (Dollars In Millions)  Carrying Value  Ownership Percentage  Carrying Value  Ownership Percentage IM Flash Technologies, LLC  $  %  $  % Cloudera, Inc.   %     % Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC   %   % Other equity method investments       Total  $ 1,446    $ 1,038   ##TABLE_ENDIM Flash Technologies, LLC and IM Flash Singapore, LLP Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron) and Intel formed IM Flash Technologies, LLC (IMFT) in 2006 and IM Flash Singapore, LLP (IMFS) in 2007 to manufacture NAND flash memory products for Micron and Intel. During 2012, we amended the operating agreement for IMFT and entered into agreements with Micron that modified our joint venture relationship, including an agreement to sell our ownership interest in IMFS. We received $ 605 million in 2012 from the sale of assets of IMFS and certain assets of IMFT to Micron. The amended operating agreement for IMFT extended the term of IMFT to 2024, unless earlier terminated under certain terms and conditions, and provides that IMFT may manufacture certain emerging memory technologies in addition to NAND flash memory. The amended agreement also provides for certain rights that, beginning in 2015, will enable us to sell to Micron or enable Micron to purchase from us our interest in IMFT. If we exercise this right, Micron would set the closing date of the transaction within two years following such election and could elect to receive financing from us for one to two years. Additionally, our agreements with Micron include a supply agreement for Micron to supply us with NAND flash memory products. These agreements also extend and expand our NAND joint development program with Micron to include emerging memory technologies. IMFT is a variable interest entity. All costs of the IMFT joint venture will be passed on to Micron and Intel pursuant to our purchase agreements. Intel's portion of IMFT costs, primarily related to product purchases and production-related services, was approximately $400 million in 2014 (approximately $380 million in 2013 and approximately $705 million in 2012 ). Subsequent to the sale of our ownership interest in IMFS in the second quarter of 2012, we no longer incur costs related to IMFS. The amount due to IMFT for product purchases and services provided was approximately $60 million as of December 27, 2014 (approximately $75 million as of December 28, 2013 ). IMFT returned $6 million to Intel in 2014 , which is reflected as a return of equity method investment within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows ( $45 million in 2013 and $137 million in 2012 ). IMFT depends on Micron and Intel for any additional cash needs. Our known maximum exposure to loss approximated the carrying value of our investment balance in IMFT, which was $713 million as of December 27, 2014 . Except for the amount due to IMFT for product purchases and services, we did not have any additional liabilities recognized on our consolidated balance sheets in connection with our interests in this joint venture as of December 27, 2014 . Our potential future losses could be higher than the carrying amount of our investment, as Intel and Micron are liable for other future operating costs or obligations of IMFT. Future cash calls could also increase our investment balance and the related exposure to loss. In addition, because we are currently committed to purchasing 49% of IMFTs production output and production-related services, we may be required to purchase products at a cost in excess of realizable value. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) We have determined that we do not have the characteristics of a consolidating investor in the variable interest entity and, therefore, we account for our interest in IMFT (and accounted for our prior interest in IMFS) using the equity method of accounting. Cloudera, Inc. During 2014, we invested in Cloudera, Inc. (Cloudera). Our fully-diluted ownership interest in Cloudera is 17% as of December 27, 2014 . Our investment is accounted for under the equity and cost methods of accounting based on the rights associated with different securities we own, and is classified within other long-term assets. As of December 27, 2014 , the carrying value of our equity method investment was $280 million and of our cost method investment was $454 million . Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC During 2011, Intel and General Electric Company (GE) formed Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC (Care Innovations), an equally owned joint venture in the healthcare industry, that focuses on independent living and delivery of health-related services by means of telecommunications. The company was formed by combining assets of GE Healthcares Home Health division and Intels Digital Health Group. Care Innovations is a variable interest entity and depends on Intel and GE for any additional cash needs. Our known maximum exposure to loss approximated the carrying value of our investment balance in Care Innovations, which was $108 million as of December 27, 2014 . Intel and GE equally share the power to direct all of Care Innovations' activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. We have determined that we do not have the characteristics of a consolidating investor in the variable interest entity and, therefore, we account for our interest in Care Innovations using the equity method of accounting. Clearwire Communications, LLC During 2013, we sold our interest in Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC), which we originally acquired in 2008, for proceeds of $328 million . These proceeds are included in other investing within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. We recognized a gain on the sale of our interest in Clearwire LLC of $328 million . For proceeds received and gains recognized for each investment, see \" Note 20: Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments, Net .\" Non-marketable cost method investments The carrying value of our non-marketable cost method investments was $1.8 billion as of December 27, 2014 ( $1.3 billion as of December 28, 2013 ), of which $454 million related to our cost method investment in Cloudera. In 2014 , we recognized impairments of $130 million on non-marketable cost method investments, which is included within gains (losses) on equity investments, net on the consolidated statements of income ( $103 million in 2013 and $104 million in 2012 ). Trading Assets As of December 27, 2014 , and December 28, 2013 , all of our trading assets were marketable debt instruments. Net losses related to trading assets still held at the reporting date were $530 million in 2014 (net losses of $70 million in 2013 and net gains of $16 million in 2012 ). Net gains on the related derivatives were $525 million in 2014 (net gains of $86 million in 2013 and $11 million in 2012 ). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 6: Derivative Financial Instruments  Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk, commodity price risk, and credit risk.  Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to currency exchange rate risk, and generally hedge our exposures with currency forward contracts, currency interest rate swaps, or currency options. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases is incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, the Chinese yuan, and the Israeli shekel . We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in the fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. Our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable are generally hedged with offsetting currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. We may also hedge currency risk arising from funding foreign currency denominated forecasted investments. These programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements . Our currency risk management programs include: ##TABLE_START  Currency derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize currency forward contracts and currency options to hedge exposures to the variability in the U.S.-dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S.-dollar-denominated cash flows. These instruments generally mature within 12 months . For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and we reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Currency derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities, non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets, and hedges of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated loans receivable recognized at fair value. The majority of these instruments mature within 12 months . Changes in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of the underlying assets and liabilities are approximately offset by the changes in fair value of the related derivatives. We record net gains or losses in the line item on the consolidated statements of income most closely associated with the related exposures, primarily in interest and other, net, except for equity-related gains or losses, which we primarily record in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END Interest Rate Risk Our primary objective for holding investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields. We generally swap the returns on our investments in fixed-rate debt instruments with remaining maturities longer than six months into U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns, unless management specifically approves otherwise. These swaps are settled at various interest payment times involving cash payments at each interest and principal payment date, with the majority of the contracts having quarterly payments. Our interest rate risk management programs include: ##TABLE_START  Interest rate derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest characteristics of debt instruments. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and we reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interest rate derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize interest rate swaps and currency interest rate swaps in economic hedging transactions, including hedges of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets and hedges of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated loans receivable recognized at fair value. Floating interest rates on the swaps generally reset on a quarterly basis. Changes in the fair value of the debt instruments classified as trading assets and loans receivable recognized at fair value are generally offset by changes in fair value of the related derivatives, both of which are recorded in interest and other, net. ##TABLE_END 75 INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Equity Market Risk Our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities at the inception of our investments. Before we enter into hedge arrangements, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors, as well as the expected timing of disposal, to determine whether hedging is appropriate. Our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives. We recognize changes in the fair value of such derivatives in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. We also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses and gains on the related liabilities , both of which are recorded in either cost of sales or operating expenses. Deferred compensation liabilities were $1.2 billion as of December 27, 2014 ( $1.1 billion as of December 28, 2013 ), and are included in other accrued liabilities. Commodity Price Risk We operate facilities that consume commodities and have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in the fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices, such as those for natural gas. These programs reduce, but do not always eliminate, the impact of commodity price movements. Our commodity price risk management program includes commodity derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize commodity swap contracts to hedge future cash flow exposures to the variability in commodity prices. These instruments generally mature within 12 months . For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain (loss) from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction.

(Tsinghua Unigroup), an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co. Ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop Intel architecture- and communications-based solutions for smartphones. Subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, we have also agreed to invest up to RMB 9.0 billion (approximately $1.5 billion as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately 20% of the holding company under Tsinghua Unigroup. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into $1.5 billion of forward contracts to hedge our anticipated equity funding of the Tsinghua Unigroup investment. The hedges were designated as cash flow hedges and the related gains and losses attributable to changes in the spot rates will be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the Tsinghua Unigroup shares are either disposed of or impaired. As the shares are either disposed of or impaired, we will reclassify the gains or losses from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to gains (losses) on equity investments, net as an offset to the gain or loss recognized for the share disposal or impairment. Hedge gains and losses attributable to changes in the forward rates will be recognized in interest and other, net.

When possible, we enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. For presentation on our consolidated balance sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterpartys relative credit standing. Most of our investments in debt instruments are in A/A2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated AA-/Aa3 or better . Our investment policy requires substantially all investments with original maturities at the time of investment of up to six months to be rated at least A-2/P-2 by Standard  Poors/Moodys, and specifies a higher minimum rating for investments with longer maturities. For instance, investments with maturities of greater than three years generally require a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3 at the time of investment. Government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, or the absence of A-rated counterparties in certain countries, result in some minor exceptions. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterpartys obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of December 27, 2014 , our total credit exposure to any single counterparty did not exceed $750 million . We obtain and secure available collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions, when we deem it appropriate. A substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers . We also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries . Our three largest customers accounted for 46% of net revenue for 2014 ( 44% for 2013 and 43% for 2012 ). These three customers accounted for 43% of net accounts receivable as of December 27, 2014 ( 34% as of December 28, 2013 ). We believe that the net accounts receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk, based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe that credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 8: Acquisitions  During 2014, we completed eight acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate consideration of $ 963 million , substantially all cash consideration. A substantial majority of the consideration was allocated to goodwill and acquisition related developed technology. Included in these acquisitions is our acquisition of the Axxia Networking Business (Axxia business) of Avago Technologies Limited, intended to accelerate growth in the mobile wireless base station business. We acquired the Axxia business in the fourth quarter of 2014 for net cash consideration of $650 million , substantially all of which was allocated to goodwill and acquisition-related developed technology intangible assets. The operating results of the Axxia business are included in our Data Center Group (DCG) operating segment. During 2013, we completed 12 acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate net cash consideration of $925 million . Most of the consideration was allocated to goodwill and acquisition-related developed technology intangible assets. Included in these acquisitions is our acquisition of Stonesoft Oyj (Stonesoft) to expand our network security solutions, specifically addressing next-generation firewall products. We acquired Stonesoft in the third quarter of 2013 for net cash consideration of $381 million , substantially all of which was allocated to goodwill and acquisition-related developed technology intangible assets. Stonesoft's operating results are included in our software and services operating segments. During 2012, we completed 15 acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate net cash consideration of $638 million . Substantially all of the consideration was allocated to goodwill and acquisition-related developed technology intangible assets. Acquisitions completed in 2014, 2013, and 2012, both individually and in the aggregate, were not significant to our results of operations. For information on the assignment of goodwill to our operating segments, see \" Note 10: Goodwill \" and for information on the classification of intangible assets, see \" Note 11: Identified Intangible Assets .\" Note 9: Divestitures  During the first quarter of 2014, we completed the divestiture of the assets of Intel Media, a business division dedicated to the development of cloud TV products and services, to Verizon Communications Inc. As a result of the transaction, we received aggregate net cash consideration of $ 150 million , included within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows, and recognized a gain within interest and other, net on the consolidated statements of income.

Due to this reorganization, goodwill was allocated from our prior reporting units to our new reporting units, as shown in the preceding table within \"transfers.\" The allocation was based on the fair value of each business group within its original reporting unit relative to the fair value of that reporting unit. During 2013, we completed a reorganization that transferred a portion of our wired connectivity business formerly included within the Data Center Group (DCG) to the PC Client Group (PCCG). Due to this reorganization, goodwill was transferred from DCG to PCCG. Also during 2013, we completed a reorganization of Intel Mobile Communications (IMC) into our Multi-Comm and existing Phone Group operating segments. Goodwill related to the former IMC was allocated between Multi-Comm and the Phone Group within the \"other Intel architecture\" operating segments. For further information on these reorganizations, see \" Note 26: Operating Segments and Geographic Information .\" During the fourth quarters of 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , we completed our annual impairment assessments and we concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years.

In the third quarter of 2011, we issued $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, primarily to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock repurchase program, and for general corporate purposes. Our senior notes pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually. We may redeem our senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time at our option at specified redemption prices. The senior notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and will effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Convertible Debentures In 2009, we issued $2.0 billion of 2009 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2039 (2009 debentures). In 2005, we issued $1.6 billion of 2005 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2035 (2005 debentures). Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually. ##TABLE_START    Debentures  Debentures Annual stated coupon interest rate  3.25 %  2.95 % Annual effective interest rate  7.20 %  6.45 % ##TABLE_ENDThe effective interest rate is based on the rate, at inception, for a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature. 2009 Debentures The 2009 debentures have a contingent interest component that requires us to pay interest based on certain thresholds or for certain events, commencing on August 1, 2019. After such date, if the 10 -day average trading price of $1,000 principal amount of the bond immediately preceding any six -month interest period is less than or equal to $650 or greater than or equal to $1,500 , we are required to pay contingent 0.25% or 0.50% annual interest, respectively. The fair value of the related contingent interest embedded derivative was $8 million as of December 27, 2014 ( $10 million as of December 28, 2013 ). The 2009 debentures are convertible, subject to certain conditions. Holders can surrender the 2009 debentures for conversion if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter. We will settle any conversion of the 2009 debentures in cash up to the face value, and any amount in excess of face value will be settled in cash or stock at our option. On or after August 5, 2019, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2009 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period. In addition, if certain events occur in the future, the indentures governing the 2009 debentures provide that each holder of the debentures can, for a pre-defined period of time, require us to repurchase the holders debentures for the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The 2009 debentures are subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior debt and to the other liabilities of our subsidiaries. We have concluded that the 2009 debentures are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded stock conversion options qualify as derivatives. In addition, we have concluded that the embedded conversion options would be classified in stockholders equity if they were freestanding derivative instruments. As such, the embedded conversion options are not accounted for separately as derivative liabilities. 2005 Debentures The 2005 debentures have a contingent interest component that requires us to pay interest based on certain thresholds or for certain events. If the 10 -day average trading price of $1,000 principal amount of the bond immediately preceding any six -month interest period is less than or equal to $800 or greater than or equal to $1,300 , we are required to pay contingent 0.25% or 0.40% annual interest, respectively. As of December 27, 2014 , we met the upside contingent interest threshold. For the six -month interest period beginning December 15, 2014 , we will accrue and pay contingent interest in the amount of 0.40% per annum of the average trading price for the 10 trading days immediately preceding the first day of the interest period. The fair value of the related contingent interest embedded derivative was $4 million as of December 27, 2014 ( $9 million as of December 28, 2013 ). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The 2005 debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock. Holders can surrender the 2005 debentures for conversion at any time. We can settle any conversion of the 2005 debentures in cash or stock at our option. The 2005 debentures will become redeemable if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period. Once this condition has been met, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2005 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if certain events occur in the future, the indentures governing the 2005 debentures provide that each holder of the debentures can, for a pre-defined period of time, require us to repurchase the holders debentures for the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The 2005 debentures are subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior debt and to the other liabilities of our subsidiaries. We have concluded that the 2005 debentures are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded stock conversion options qualify as derivatives. In addition, we have concluded that the embedded conversion options would be classified in stockholders equity if they were freestanding derivative instruments. As such, the embedded conversion options are not accounted for separately as derivative liabilities. ##TABLE_START    2009 Debentures  2005 Debentures (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013 Outstanding principal  $ 2,000  $ 2,000  $ 1,600  $ 1,600 Equity component (including temporary equity) carrying amount  $  $  $  $ Unamortized discount  $  $  $  $ Net debt carrying amount  $ 1,088  $ 1,075  $  $ Conversion rate (shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures)  46.06  45.57  34.95  34.60 Effective conversion price (per share of common stock)  $ 21.71  $ 21.94  $ 28.61  $ 28.90 ##TABLE_ENDIn the preceding table, the remaining amortization periods for the unamortized discounts for the 2009 and 2005 debentures are approximately 25 and 21 years, respectively, as of December 27, 2014 . The conversion rate adjusts for certain events outlined in the indentures governing the 2009 and 2005 debentures, such as quarterly dividend distributions in excess of $0.14 and $0.10 per share for the 2009 and 2005 debentures, respectively, but it does not adjust for accrued interest. In addition, the conversion rate will increase for a holder of either the 2009 or 2005 debentures who elects to convert the debentures in connection with certain share exchanges, mergers, or consolidations involving Intel. During the fourth quarter of 2014 , the closing stock price conversion right condition of the 2009 debentures was met and the debentures will be convertible at the option of the holders during the first quarter of 2015 . As a result of the conversion period during the first quarter of 2015 , the $1.1 billion carrying amount of the 2009 debentures was classified as short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 27, 2014 . The excess of the amount of cash payable if converted over the carrying amount of the 2009 debentures of $912 million has been classified as temporary equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 27, 2014 . In future periods, if the closing stock price conversion right condition is no longer met, all outstanding 2009 debentures would be reclassified to long-term debt and the temporary equity would be reclassified to stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet. The 2009 debentures were not convertible for the first quarter of 2014 ; therefore the liability and equity components of the 2009 debentures were classified as long-term debt and stockholders equity, respectively, as of December 28, 2013 . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Debt Maturities Our aggregate debt maturities based on outstanding principal as of December 27, 2014 , by year payable, were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)    $   1,500  3,000     2020 and thereafter  10,275 Total  $ 14,775 ##TABLE_ENDIn the preceding table, the 2009 debentures are classified based on their stated maturity date, regardless of their classification on the consolidated balance sheet . Substantially all of the difference between the total aggregate debt maturities in the preceding table and the total carrying amount of our debt is due to the unamortized discount of our convertible debentures and the short-term classification of the 2009 debentures. Note 16: Retirement Benefit Plans  Retirement Contribution Plans We provide tax-qualified retirement contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. and certain other countries. The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees hired prior to January 1, 2011 are eligible for and receive discretionary employer contributions in the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2011 receive discretionary employer contributions in the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan, which are participant-directed. Our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) determines the annual discretionary employer contribution amounts for the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan and the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan under delegation of authority from our Board of Directors, pursuant to the terms of the plans. As of December 27, 2014 , 84% of our U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan assets were invested in equities and 16% were invested in fixed-income instruments. These assets are managed by external investment managers. Effective January 1, 2015, the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution plan assets and future discretionary employer contributions will be participant-directed. For the benefit of eligible U.S. employees, we also provide a non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees. This plan is designed to permit certain discretionary employer contributions and to permit employee deferral of a portion of compensation in addition to their Intel 401(k) Savings Plan deferrals. This plan is unfunded. We expensed $286 million for the qualified and non-qualified U.S. retirement contribution plans in 2014 ( $298 million in 2013 and $357 million in 2012 ). In the first quarter of 2015 , we funded $277 million for the 2014 contributions to the qualified U.S. retirement contribution plans. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans U.S. Pension Benefits. For employees hired prior to January 1, 2011, we provide a tax-qualified defined-benefit pension plan, the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan, for eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. During the second quarter of 2014, we communicated to employees our intent, beginning on January 1, 2015, to freeze future benefit accruals in the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan to all employees at or above a specific grade level, and generally covering all highly compensated employees in the plan. Starting in 2016, the impacted employees will receive discretionary employer contributions in the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan, instead of the Retirement Contribution plan. This change was contingent on receiving a favorable private letter ruling (PLR) from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which we filed for in January 2014. A favorable PLR was received in October 2014 and resulted in a $1.1 billion reduction in our projected benefit obligation, most of which was also included as a change in actuarial valuation on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan benefit is determined by a participants years of service and final average compensation as defined by the plan document. The plan generates a minimum pension benefit if the participants U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan benefit exceeds the annuitized value of their U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan benefit. If participant balances in the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan do not grow sufficiently, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan could increase significantly. Consistent with applicable law, assets of the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan are held in trust, solely for the benefit of plan participants, and are not available for general corporate purposes. Non-U.S. Pension Benefits. We also provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain other countries, most significantly Germany, Ireland, and Israel. Consistent with the requirements of local law, we deposit funds for certain plans with insurance companies, with third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts, and/or accrue for the unfunded portion of the obligation. The Ireland pension plan and one of our Germany pension plans were closed to employees hired on or after June 20, 2012 and January 1, 2014, respectively. U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits. Upon retirement, eligible U.S. employees who were hired prior to January 1, 2014 are credited with a defined dollar amount, based on years of service, into a U.S. Sheltered Employee Retirement Medical Account (SERMA). These credits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase coverage in the retirees choice of medical plan. If the available credits are not sufficient to pay the entire cost of the coverage, the remaining cost is the retirees responsibility. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2014 are not eligible to earn a SERMA benefit. Funding Policy. Our practice is to fund the various pension plans and the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of applicable local laws and regulations. Additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate. Depending on the design of the plan, local customs, and market circumstances, the liabilities of a plan may exceed qualified plan assets. Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets The changes in the projected benefit obligations and plan assets for the plans described above were as follows: ##TABLE_START    U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits (In Millions)       Beginning projected benefit obligation  $ 1,137  $ 1,742  $ 1,695  $ 1,412  $  $ Service cost       Interest cost       Actuarial (gain) loss   (746 )     (56 ) Currency exchange rate changes      (254 )      Plan curtailments  (1,083 )           Other  (59 )  (45 )   (22 )  (22 )  Ending projected benefit obligation  $  $ 1,137  $ 2,423  $ 1,695  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START    U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits (In Millions)       Beginning fair value of plan assets  $  $  $ 1,005  $  $  $ Actual return on plan assets       Employer contributions          Currency exchange rate changes      (114 )      Other  (56 )  (45 )  (27 )  (5 )  (1 )  (7 ) Ending fair value of plan assets  $  $  $ 1,017  $ 1,005  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDINTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START    U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits (In Millions)  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013 Other long-term assets  $   $   $  $  $   $  Other long-term liabilities  (269 )  (488 )  (1,420 )  (706 )  (119 )  (114 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (income), before tax    1,217    Net amount recognized  $ (268 )  $ (233 )  $ (189 )  $ (170 )  $ (86 )  $ (71 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) before taxes at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START    U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits (In Millions)  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013 Net prior service credit (cost)  $   $   $ (13 )  $  $ (48 )  $ (54 ) Net actuarial gain (loss)  (1 )  (255 )  (1,204 )  (545 )   Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), before tax  $ (1 )  $ (255 )  $ (1,217 )  $ (520 )  $ (33 )  $ (43 ) ##TABLE_ENDWe use a corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of ten percent of the larger of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized on a straight-line basis. The period of amortization is the average remaining service of active participants who are expected to receive benefits under the plans. As of December 27, 2014 , the accumulated benefit obligation was $808 million for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan ( $497 million as of December 28, 2013 ) and $1.7 billion for the non-U.S. defined-benefit pension plans ( $1.3 billion as of December 28, 2013 ). Included in the aggregate data in the following tables are the amounts applicable to our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, as well as plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. Amounts related to such plans at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START    U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits (In Millions)  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013 Plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:         Accumulated benefit obligations  $  $   $ 1,344  $ Plan assets  $  $   $  $ Plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:         Projected benefit obligations  $  $ 1,137  $ 2,361  $ 1,295 Plan assets  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDOn a worldwide basis, our pension and postretirement benefit plans were 54% funded as of December 27, 2014 . The U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan, which accounts for 23% of the worldwide pension and postretirement benefit obligations, was 70% funded. Funded status is not indicative of our ability to pay ongoing pension benefits or of our obligation to fund retirement trusts. Required pension funding for U.S. retirement plans is determined in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which sets required minimum contributions. Cumulative company funding to the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan currently exceeds the minimum ERISA funding requirements. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Assumptions Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START    U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits    Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013 Discount rate  3.8 %  4.8 %  2.7 %  4.0 %  4.1 %  4.6 % Rate of compensation increase  3.8 %  3.8 %  4.0 %  3.9 %  n/a  n/a ##TABLE_ENDWeighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine costs for the plans for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START    U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits            Discount rate  4.6 %  3.9 %  4.7 %  4.0 %  4.2 %  5.0 %  4.6 %  4.2 %  4.6 % Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  5.4 %  4.5 %  5.0 %  5.7 %  5.2 %  5.9 %  7.4 %  7.7 %  3.0 % Rate of compensation increase  3.8 %  4.1 %  4.5 %  4.1 %  4.3 %  4.1 %  n/a  n/a  n/a ##TABLE_ENDFor the U.S. plans, we developed the discount rate by calculating the benefit payment streams by year to determine when benefit payments will be due. We then matched the benefit payment streams by year to the AA corporate bond rates to match the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments and discounted back to the measurement date to determine the appropriate discount rate. For the non-U.S. plans, we used two approaches to develop the discount rate. In certain countries, we used a model consisting of a theoretical bond portfolio for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximated the estimated benefit payments of our pension plans. In other countries, we analyzed current market long-term bond rates and matched the bond maturity with the average duration of the pension liabilities. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions takes into consideration both duration and risk of the investment portfolios, and is developed through consensus and building-block methodologies. The consensus methodology includes unadjusted estimates by the fund manager on future market expectations by broad asset classes and geography. The building-block approach determines the rates of return implied by historical risk premiums across asset classes. In addition, we analyze rates of return relevant to the country where each plan is in effect and the investments applicable to the plan, expectations of future returns, local actuarial projections, and the projected long-term rates of return from external investment managers. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets shown for the non-U.S. plan assets is weighted to reflect each countrys relative portion of the non-U.S. plan assets. Net Periodic Benefit Cost In 2014 , the net periodic benefit cost for U.S. pension benefits, non-U.S. pension benefits, and U.S. postretirement medical benefits was $36 million ( $230 million in 2013 and $210 million in 2012 ), $165 million ( $116 million in 2013 and $88 million in 2012 ) and $17 million ( $77 million in 2013 and $50 million in 2012 ), respectively. The decrease in the U.S. net periodic pension benefit cost compared to 2013 is primarily attributed to the one-time curtailment gain related to the freeze of future benefit accruals and lower recognized net actuarial losses. U.S. Pension Plan Assets In general, the investment strategy for U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets is to maximize risk-adjusted returns, taking into consideration the investment horizon and expected volatility, to ensure that there are sufficient assets available to pay pension benefits as they come due. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 55% for equity investments and 45% for fixed-income investments in 2014 . The expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets is 6.1% . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following investment categories at the end of each period: ##TABLE_START    December 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013    Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using     (In Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total  Total Equity securities  $  $  $   $  $ Fixed income      Other investments        Total assets measured at fair value  $  $  $  $  $ Cash         Total U.S. pension plan assets at fair value        $  $ ##TABLE_ENDA substantial majority of the fixed income investments in the preceding table are asset-backed securities, corporate debt, and government debt. Government debt includes instruments such as non-U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities and U.S. treasury securities. Non-U.S. Plan Assets The investments of the non-U.S. plans are managed by insurance companies, pension funds, or third-party trustees, consistent with regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. The investment manager evaluates performance by comparing the actual rate of return to the return on similar assets. Investments managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under standard contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we have discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equity investments and fixed-income investments, either through index funds or direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market risk and to ensure that the pension assets are available to pay benefits as they come due. The target allocation of the non-U.S. plan assets that we have control over is 80% equity investments and 20% fixed-income investments. The average expected long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plan assets is 5.7% . Non-U.S. plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following investment categories at the end of each period: ##TABLE_START    December 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013    Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using     (In Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total  Total Equity securities  $  $  $  $  $ Fixed income       Total assets measured at fair value  $  $  $  $  $ Cash         Total non-U.S. plan assets at fair value        $ 1,017  $ 1,005 ##TABLE_ENDSubstantially all of the equity investments in the preceding table are invested in a diversified mix of equities of developed countries, including the U.S., and emerging markets throughout the world. The substantial majority of the fixed income investments in the preceding table are investments held by insurance companies and insurance contracts that are managed by qualified insurance companies. We do not have control over the target allocation or visibility of the investment strategies of those investments. Insurance contracts and investments held by insurance companies made up 35% of total non-U.S. plan assets as of December 27, 2014 ( 38% as of December 28, 2013 ). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) U.S. Postretirement Medical Plan Assets In general, the investment strategy for U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets due to the level of expected future benefit payments. The assets are invested solely in a tax-aware global equity portfolio, which is actively managed by an external investment manager. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is comprised of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries, including the U.S., and emerging markets throughout the world. The expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets is 7.4% . As of December 27, 2014 , substantially all of the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets were invested in exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. Concentrations of Risk We manage a variety of risks, including credit, liquidity, and market risks, across our plan assets through our investment managers. We define a concentration of risk as an undiversified exposure to one of the aforementioned risks that unnecessarily increases the exposure to a loss of plan assets. We monitor exposure to such risks in both the U.S. and non-U.S. plans by monitoring the magnitude of the risk in each plan and diversifying our exposure to such risks across a variety of counterparties, instruments, and markets. As of December 27, 2014 , we did not have concentrations of risk in any single entity, manager, counterparty, sector, industry, or country. Funding Expectations Under applicable law for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan and the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan, we are not required to make any contributions during 2015 . Our expected required funding for the non-U.S. plans during 2015 is approximately $69 million . Estimated Future Benefit Payments Estimated benefit payments over the next 10 fiscal years are as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits  $  $  $ 2016  $  $  $ 2017  $  $  $ 2018  $  $  $ 2019  $  $  $ 2020-2024  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDNote 17: Commitments  A portion of our capital equipment and certain facilities are under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2028 .

Minimum rental commitments under all non-cancelable leases with an initial term in excess of one year were as follows as of December 27, 2014 : ##TABLE_START (In Millions)     $ 2016  2017  2018  2019  2020 and thereafter  Total  $ 1,070 ##TABLE_ENDINTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Commitments for construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment totaled $3.5 billion as of December 27, 2014 ( $5.5 billion as of December 28, 2013 ), substantially all of which will be due within the next 12 months. Other purchase obligations and commitments totaled approximately $2.5 billion as of December 27, 2014 (approximately $1.9 billion as of December 28, 2013 ). Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include agreements to fund various projects with other companies. In addition, we have various contractual commitments with Micron and IMFT. For further information on these contractual commitments, see \" Note 5: Cash and Investments .\" During 2012, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML intended to accelerate the development of extreme ultraviolet lithography projects and deep ultraviolet immersion lithography projects, including generic developments applicable to both 300mm and 450mm. Certain of these agreements were amended in 2014. Under the amended agreements, Intel agreed to provide RD funding totaling  829 million  over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from ASML. Our remaining obligation, contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, is approximately 562 million , or $689 million , as of December 27, 2014 . As our obligation is contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, we have excluded this obligation from other purchase obligations and commitments. Note 18: Employee Equity Incentive Plans  Our equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. Under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan), 719 million shares of common stock are available for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors through June 2016. A maximum of 517 million of these shares of common stock can be granted as restricted stock or restricted stock units. As of December 27, 2014 , 258 million shares of common stock remained available for future grant under the 2006 Plan. Going forward, we may assume the equity incentive plans and the outstanding equity awards of certain acquired companies. Once they are assumed, we do not grant additional shares of common stock under those plans. The stock options and restricted stock units issued generally retain similar terms and conditions of the respective plan under which they were originally granted. We issue restricted stock units with both a market condition and a service condition (market-based restricted stock units), referred to in our 2014 Proxy Statement as outperformance stock units, to a small group of senior officers and non-employee directors. For market-based restricted stock units issued in 2014 , the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting will range from 0% to 200% of the target amount, based on total stockholder return (TSR) on our common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of a peer group over a three -year period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. As of December 27, 2014 , 4 million market-based restricted stock units were outstanding. These market-based restricted stock units accrue dividend equivalents and generally vest three years and one month from the grant date. Equity awards granted to employees in 2014 under our equity incentive plans generally vest over four years from the date of grant, and options expire seven years from the date of grant, with the exception of market-based restricted stock units, an insignificant portion of restricted stock units granted to senior officers, and replacement awards related to acquisitions. The 2006 Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific dates. Under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan, 373 million shares of common stock are available for issuance through August 2016. As of December 27, 2014 , 197 million shares of common stock were available for issuance under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation recognized in 2014 was $1.1 billion ( $1.1 billion in 2013 and $1.1 billion in 2012 ). On a quarterly basis, we assess changes to our estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on our review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. We recognize the effect of adjustments made to the forfeiture rates, if any, in the period that we change the forfeiture estimate. The effect of forfeiture rate adjustments in all periods presented was not significant. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The total share-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory as of December 27, 2014 was $39 million ( $38 million as of December 28, 2013 and $41 million as of December 29, 2012 ). During 2014 , the tax benefit that we realized for the tax deduction from share-based awards totaled $555 million ( $385 million in 2013 and $510 million in 2012 ). We estimate the fair value of restricted stock unit awards with time-based vesting using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our shares of common stock prior to vesting. We estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock units using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant. We based the weighted average estimated value of restricted stock unit grants, as well as the weighted average assumptions that we used in calculating the fair value, on estimates at the date of grant, for each period as follows: ##TABLE_START      Estimated values  $ 25.40  $ 21.45  $ 25.32 Risk-free interest rate  0.5 %  0.2 %  0.3 % Dividend yield  3.3 %  3.8 %  3.3 % Volatility  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted under our equity incentive plans and rights to acquire shares of common stock granted under our stock purchase plan. We based the weighted average estimated value of employee stock option grants and rights granted under the stock purchase plan, as well as the weighted average assumptions used in calculating the fair value, on estimates at the date of grant, for each period as follows: ##TABLE_START    Stock Options  Stock Purchase Plan         Estimated values  $ 3.61  $ 3.11  $ 4.22  $ 5.87  $ 4.52  $ 5.47 Expected life (in years)  5.1  5.2  5.3  0.5  0.5  0.5 Risk-free interest rate  1.7 %  0.8 %  1.0 %  0.1 %  0.1 %  0.1 % Dividend yield  3.6 %  3.9 %  3.3 %  3.2 %  4.0 %  3.3 % Volatility  %  %  %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDWe base the expected volatility on implied volatility because we have determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. We use historical option exercise data as the basis for determining expected life, as we believe that historical data provides a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected life input for valuing options using the Black-Scholes model.

The grant-date fair value of awards that vested in 2014 was $949 million ( $899 million in 2013 and $816 million in 2012 ). The number of restricted stock units vested includes shares of common stock that we withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. Restricted stock units that are expected to vest are net of estimated future forfeitures. As of December 27, 2014 , there was $1.8 billion in unrecognized compensation costs related to restricted stock units granted under our equity incentive plans. We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of 1.3 years .

Stock Purchase Plan Approximately 76% of our employees were participating in our 2006 Stock Purchase Plan as of December 27, 2014 ( 76% in 2013 and 72% in 2012 ). Employees purchased 19.4 million shares of common stock in 2014 for $393 million under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan ( 20.5 million shares of common stock for $369 million in 2013 and 17.4 million shares of common stock for $355 million in 2012 ). As of December 27, 2014 there was $13 million  in unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire shares of common stock under our stock purchase plan. We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately one and a half months. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 19: Common Stock Repurchases  Common Stock Repurchase Program We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to  $65 billion in shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. This amount includes an increase of $20 billion in the authorization limit approved by our Board of Directors in July 2014. As of December 27, 2014 , $12.4 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit.  During 2014 , we repurchased 332.4 million shares of common stock at a cost of $10.8 billion ( 94.1 million shares of common stock at a cost of $2.1 billion in 2013 and 191.0 million  shares of common stock at a cost of $4.8 billion in 2012 ). We have repurchased 4.7 billion shares of common stock at a cost of $102 billion since the program began in 1990. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into a stock repurchase agreement, a portion of which was executed as a forward contract. We received collateral from the counterparty for the value attributable to the forward portion of this contract and invested the collateral into permitted investments considered restricted from other uses. As of December 27, 2014, $325 million of collateral, which approximates fair value, remains recorded as both a current asset and current liability on the consolidated balance sheet. The $325 million represents the unsettled portion of the contract and will be returned to the counterparty by December 29, 2014, the settlement date. Restricted Stock Unit Withholdings We issue restricted stock units as part of our equity incentive plans. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees.  In our consolidated financial statements, we also treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase plan . During 2014 , we withheld 12.0 million shares of common stock to satisfy $332 million ( 13.1 million shares of common stock to satisfy $293 million in 2013 and 12.6 million  shares of common stock to satisfy $345 million  in 2012 ) of employees tax obligations.

We received proceeds of $142 million  on the sale of our shares in Clearwire Corporation and $328 million on the sale of our interest in Clearwire LLC. The proceeds received on the sale of our shares in Clearwire Corporation and our interest in Clearwire LLC are included in \"sales of available-for-sale investments\" and \"other investing,\" respectively, within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. During 2013 , we recognized gains of $111 million on the sale of our shares in Clearwire Corporation and $328 million on the sale of our interest in Clearwire LLC. The total gain of $439 million on these transactions is included in \"gains (losses) on equity investments, net\" on the consolidated statements of income.

Interest expense in the preceding table is net of $276 million of interest capitalized in 2014 ( $246 million in 2013 and $240 million in 2012 ). During 2014, we completed the divestiture of our Intel Media assets. As a result of the transaction, we recognized a gain within \"other, net\" in the preceding table. For further information, see \" Note 9: Divestitures \" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

We computed diluted earnings per share of common stock using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Net income available to participating securities was insignificant for all periods presented. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock for our 2005 debentures are determined by applying the if-converted method. However, as our 2009 debentures require settlement of the principal amount of the debt in cash upon conversion, with the conversion premium paid in cash or stock at our option, potentially dilutive shares of common stock are determined by applying the treasury stock method. For further discussion on the specific conversion features of our 2005 and 2009 debentures, see \" Note 15: Borrowings .\" In 2014 , we excluded on average 10 million outstanding stock options and restricted stock units from the computation of diluted earnings per share of common stock because these shares of common stock would have been anti-dilutive ( 55 million in 2013 and 29 million in 2012 ). These options could potentially be included in the diluted earnings per share of common stock calculation in the future if the average market value of the shares of common stock increases and is greater than the exercise price of these options. In all years presented, we included our 2009 debentures in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of common stock because the average market price was above the conversion price. We could potentially exclude the 2009 debentures in the future if the average market price is below the conversion price.

It was also reenacted in the first quarter of 2013, retroactive to the beginning of 2012. A substantial majority of the increase in our effective tax rate between 2014 and 2013 was driven by the reenacted U.S. RD tax credit in 2013 containing two years' worth of RD tax credits. The full year 2012 impact of the U.S. RD tax credit was recognized in the first quarter of 2013. Income in certain non-U.S. countries is fully exempt from income taxes for a limited period of time due to eligible activities and certain capital investment actions. These full tax exemptions expire at various dates through 2023 ; however, the exemptions in certain countries are eligible for renewal. In 2014 , the tax benefit attributable to tax holidays was $166 million ( $213 million for 2013 and $252 million for 2012 ) with a $0.03 impact on diluted earnings per share ( $0.04 for 2013 and $0.05 for 2012 ). During 2014 , net income tax benefits attributable to equity-based compensation transactions that were allocated to stockholders equity totaled $103 million (net benefits of $3 million in 2013 and net benefits of $137 million in 2012 ). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Deferred and Current Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes.

The valuation allowance is based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. The valuation allowance as of December 27, 2014 included allowances related to unrealized state credit carryforwards of $507 million and matters related to our non-U.S. subsidiaries of $88 million . As of December 27, 2014 , our federal, state, and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $219 million , $375 million , and $393 million , respectively. Approximately one third of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The remaining non-U.S. as well as the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2034 . A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. relates to acquisitions and, as a result, is limited in the amount that can be recognized in any one year. The non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards include $291 million that is not likely to be recovered and has been reduced by a valuation allowance. As of December 27, 2014 , we had not recognized U.S. deferred income taxes on a cumulative total of $23.3 billion of undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and $1.6 billion of other basis differences of our investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries primarily related to McAfee. Determining the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to investments in these non-U.S. subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested is not practicable.

If the remaining balance of $577 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 27, 2014 ( $207 million as of December 28, 2013 ) was recognized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $485 million ( $81 million as of December 28, 2013 ) and a reduction in the effective tax rate. During all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of income. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were $21 million in 2014 ( insignificant in 2013 and 2012 ). As of December 27, 2014 , we had $44 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits ( $73 million as of December 28, 2013 ). Intel's tax policy is to comply with the laws, regulations, filing requirements of all jurisdictions in which Intel conducts business. We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain U.S. federal and non-U.S. tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could significantly increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. Positions that may be resolved include issues involving asset tax basis, transfer pricing, and various other matters. We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 27, 2014 could decrease by approximately $25 million to $465 million in the next 12 months. We file federal, state, and non-U.S. tax returns. For state and non-U.S. tax returns, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2002 . For federal tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2009 .

The change in actuarial valuation in 2014 in the preceding table includes $1.4 billion in actuarial losses arising during the year offset by a $1.0 billion reduction in losses due to a freeze of future benefit accruals in the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan.

We estimate that we will reclassify approximately $336 million (before taxes) of net derivative losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings within the next 12 months. Note 25: Contingencies  Legal Proceedings We are a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted in this section. Although management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Government Competition Matters and Related Consumer Class Actions A number of proceedings generally have challenged and continue to challenge certain of our competitive practices. The allegations in these proceedings vary and are described in more detail in the following paragraphs. In general, they contend that we improperly conditioned price rebates and other discounts on our microprocessors on exclusive or near-exclusive dealing by some of our customers; and they allege that our software compiler business unfairly preferred Intel  microprocessors over competing microprocessors and that, through the use of our compilers and other means, we have caused the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading benchmark results concerning our microprocessors. Based on the procedural posture of the various remaining competition matters, which we describe in the following paragraphs, our investment of resources to explain and defend our position has declined as compared to the period 2005-2011. Nonetheless, certain of the matters remain active, and these challenges could continue for a number of years, potentially requiring us to invest additional resources. We believe that we compete lawfully and that our marketing, business, intellectual property, and other challenged practices benefit our customers and our stockholders, and we will continue to conduct a vigorous defense in the remaining proceedings. In 2001, the European Commission (EC) commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy our microprocessors. We received numerous requests for information and documents from the EC and we responded to each of those requests. The EC issued a Statement of Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. In May 2009, the EC issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged \" conditional rebates and payments\" that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged \" payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.\" The EC imposed a fine in the amount of 1.06 billion ( $1.447 billion as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to \"immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in\" the EC decision. The EC decision contained no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision stated that we should \"cease and desist\" from further conduct that, in the EC's opinion, would violate applicable law. We took steps, which are subject to the EC's ongoing review, to comply with that decision pending appeal. We had discussions with the EC to better understand the decision and to explain changes to our business practices. We appealed the EC decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The hearing of our appeal took place in July 2012. In June 2014, the General Court rejected our appeal in its entirety. In August 2014, we filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. On November 11, 2014, Intervener Association for Competitive Technologies filed comments in support of Intels grounds of appeal. The EC and interveners filed briefs in November, after which the Court of Justice is likely to allow the parties to file a final round of briefs by February 2015. The Court of Justice is likely to hold oral argument in late 2015 and issue its decision in 2016. At least 82 separate class-action lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. District Courts for the Northern District of California, Southern District of California, District of Idaho, District of Nebraska, District of New Mexico, District of Maine, and District of Delaware, as well as in various California, Kansas, and Tennessee state courts. These actions generally repeat the allegations made in a now-settled lawsuit filed against us by AMD in June 2005 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (AMD litigation). Like the AMD litigation, these class-action lawsuits allege that we engaged in various actions in violation of the Sherman Act and other laws by, among other things: providing discounts and rebates to our manufacturer and distributor customers conditioned on exclusive or near-exclusive dealing that allegedly unfairly interfered with AMD ' s ability to sell its microprocessors; interfering with certain AMD product launches; and interfering with AMD ' s participation in certain industry standards-setting groups. The class actions allege various consumer injuries, including that consumers in various states have been injured by paying higher prices for computers containing our microprocessors. We dispute these class-action claims and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) All of the federal and state class actions other than the California class actions were transferred by the Multidistrict Litigation Panel to the U.S. District Court in Delaware for all pre-trial proceedings and discovery (MDL proceedings). The Delaware district court appointed a Special Master to address issues in the MDL proceedings, as assigned by the court. In January 2010, the plaintiffs in the Delaware action filed a motion for sanctions for our alleged failure to preserve evidence. This motion largely copies a motion previously filed by AMD in the AMD litigation, which has settled. The plaintiffs in the MDL proceedings also moved for certification of a class of members who purchased certain personal computers containing products sold by us. In July 2010, the Special Master issued a Report and Recommendation (Report) denying the motion to certify a class. The MDL plaintiffs filed objections to the Special Master's Report, and a hearing on those objections was held before the district court in July 2013. In July 2014, the district court affirmed the Special Master's ruling and issued an order denying the MDL plaintiffs' motion for class certification. In August 2014, plaintiffs filed a petition for interlocutory appeal of the district court's decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which the Third Circuit denied on October 29, 2014. On December 29, 2014, Intel filed a motion for summary judgment on the claims of the remaining individual plaintiffs. The court is likely to rule on this motion in late 2015. All California class actions have been consolidated in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County. The plaintiffs in the California actions moved for class certification, which we are in the process of opposing. At our request, the court in the California actions agreed to delay ruling on this motion until after the Delaware district court ruled on the similar motion in the MDL proceedings. The plaintiffs asked the court for leave to retain a new expert and to amend their previous motion for class certification. The court granted plaintiffs request on February 6, 2015 and set the hearing on plaintiffs new motion for class certification for May 29, 2015. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from these matters. In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation  Between May and July 2011, former employees of Intel, Adobe Systems Incorporated, Apple Inc., Google Inc., Intuit Inc., Lucasfilm Ltd., and Pixar filed antitrust class-action lawsuits in the California Superior Courts alleging that these companies had entered into a conspiracy to suppress the compensation of their employees. The lawsuits were removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and in September 2011 the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, captioned In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation . The plaintiffs allegations reference the 2009 and 2010 investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ) into employment practices in the technology industry, as well as the DOJs complaints and subsequent stipulated final judgments with the seven companies named as defendants in the lawsuits. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants entered into certain unlawful agreements not to cold call employees of particular other defendants and that there was an overarching conspiracy among the defendants. Plaintiffs assert one such agreement specific to Intel, namely that Intel and Google entered into an agreement starting in 2005, not to cold call each other's employees. Plaintiffs assert claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act and Section 4 of the Clayton Antitrust Act and seek a declaration that the defendants alleged actions violated the antitrust laws, damages trebled as provided for by law under the Sherman Act or Clayton Act, restitution and disgorgement, and attorneys fees and costs. In October 2013, the district court certified a class consisting of approximately 65,000 current or former employees of the seven defendants and set the matter for trial in late May 2014. The so-called \"technical class\" consists of a group of current and former technical, creative, and RD employees at each of the defendants. In January 2014, Intel filed a motion for summary judgment, which the court denied in March 2014. In April 2014, Intel, Adobe, Apple, and Google reached an agreement with plaintiffs to settle this lawsuit, but in August 2014, the district court denied preliminary approval of the settlement. In September 2014, defendants filed a petition for writ of mandamus asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to reverse the district courts decision. The Ninth Circuit ordered briefing and scheduled a March 2015 hearing date on the writ petition. Defendants have withdrawn the petition for writ of mandamus in light of the settlement agreement discussed below. In January 2015, Intel, Adobe, Apple, and Google reached a second agreement with plaintiffs to settle this lawsuit, which is subject to court approval. The court has scheduled a hearing on plaintiffs' motion for preliminary approval for March 2015. We continue to dispute the plaintiffs claims, but have agreed to settle this lawsuit to avoid the uncertainties, expenses, and diversion of resources from continued litigation. Our operating expenses for 2014 reflect accruals for this proceeding and we believe reasonably possible losses in excess of the accrued amount are not material to our financial statements. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In re Intel Corporation Shareholder Derivative Litigation In March 2014, the Police Retirement System of St. Louis filed a shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County against the members of our Board of Directors, certain former Board members, and a current officer. The complaint alleges that the defendants breached their duties to the company by participating in, or allowing, alleged antitrust violations, as described in In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation . In March 2014, a second plaintiff, Barbara Templeton, filed a substantially similar derivative suit in the same court. In May 2014, a third shareholder, Robert Achermann, filed a substantially similar derivative action in the same court. The court consolidated the three actions into one, which is captioned In re Intel Corporation Shareholder Derivative Litigation . Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint in July 2014. In September 2014, the court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, but granted plaintiffs leave to amend. Plaintiffs are expected to file an amended consolidated complaint in February 2015. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. v. Intel In May 2013, Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. (LOTC) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LBHI) filed an adversary complaint in the United States Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York asserting claims against us arising from a 2008 contract between Intel and LOTC. Under the terms of the 2008 contract, we prepaid $1.0 billion to LOTC, in exchange for which LOTC was required to deliver to us on or before September 29, 2008, quantities of Intel common stock and cash determined by a formula set forth in the contract. LOTC's performance under the contract was secured by $1.0 billion of cash collateral. Under the terms of the contract, LOTC was obligated to deliver approximately 50 million shares of our common stock to us on September 29, 2008. LOTC failed to deliver any Intel common stock or cash, and we exercised our right of setoff against the $1.0 billion collateral. LOTC and LBHI acknowledge in their complaint that we were entitled to set off our losses against the collateral, but they assert that we withheld collateral in excess of our losses that should have been returned to LOTC. The complaint asserts a claim for breach of contract, a claim for \"turnover\" under section 542(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, and a claim for violation of the automatic stay under section 362(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code. The complaint does not expressly quantify the amount of damages claimed, but does assert multiple theories of damages that impliedly seek up to $312 million of alleged excess collateral, plus interest at LIBOR plus 13.5% , compounded daily. In June 2013, we filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs' bankruptcy claims and for a determination that the breach of contract claim is \"non-core\" under the Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy court granted our motion in its entirety in December 2013. In May 2014, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York denied our request that it withdraw its reference of plaintiffs' adversary complaint to the bankruptcy court. In January 2015, Intel and the plaintiffs filed competing motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs' motion requests judgment against Intel \"in the amount of no less than\" $129 million , plus interest. We believe that $129 million , plus interest, represents the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for this case, although we believe that we acted in a manner consistent with our contractual rights and intend to defend against any claim to the contrary. McAfee, Inc. Shareholder Litigation On August 19, 2010, we announced that we had agreed to acquire all of the common stock of McAfee, Inc. (McAfee) for $48.00 per share. Four McAfee shareholders filed putative class-action lawsuits in Santa Clara County, California Superior Court challenging the proposed transaction. The cases were ordered consolidated in September 2010. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that named former McAfee board members, McAfee, and Intel as defendants, and alleged that the McAfee board members breached their fiduciary duties and that McAfee and Intel aided and abetted those breaches of duty. The complaint requested rescission of the merger agreement, such other equitable relief as the court may deem proper, and an award of damages in an unspecified amount. In June 2012, the plaintiffs damages expert asserted that the value of a McAfee share for the purposes of assessing damages should be $62.08 . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In January 2012, the court certified the action as a class action, appointed the Central Pension Laborers Fund to act as the class representative, and scheduled trial to begin in January 2013. In March 2012, defendants filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse the class certification order; the petition was denied in June 2012. In March 2012, at defendants request, the court held that plaintiffs were not entitled to a jury trial, and ordered a bench trial. In April 2012, plaintiffs filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse that order, which the court of appeal denied in July 2012. In August 2012, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted that motion in November 2012, and entered final judgment in the case in February 2013. In April 2013, plaintiffs appealed the final judgment. Intel, McAfee, and McAfees board of directors filed an opposition to plaintiffs appeal in December 2014. Because the resolution of the appeal may materially impact the scope and nature of the proceeding, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from this matter. We dispute the class-action claims and intend to continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously. X2Y Attenuators, LLC v. Intel et al In May 2011, X2Y Attenuators, LLC (X2Y) filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania and a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) pursuant to Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 against us and two of our customers, Apple and Hewlett-Packard Company, alleging infringement of five patents. X2Y subsequently added a sixth patent to both actions. The district court action was stayed pending resolution of the ITC proceeding. X2Y alleged that at least Intel  Core  and Intel  Xeon  processor families infringe the asserted patents. X2Y also requested that the ITC issue permanent exclusion and cease-and-desist orders to, among other things, prohibit us from importing these microprocessors and Apple and Hewlett-Packard Company products that incorporate these microprocessors into the U.S. In the stayed district court action, X2Y seeks unspecified damages, including enhanced damages for alleged willful infringement, and injunctive relief. In June 2012, the Administrative Law Judge issued an initial determination granting X2Ys motion to partially terminate the ITC investigation with respect to three of the asserted patents. The Administrative Law Judge held a hearing on the remaining three patents in August 2012 and issued an initial determination in December 2012. In the initial determination, the Administrative Law Judge found that Intel, Apple, and Hewlett-Packard Company have not violated Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 because they have not infringed any of the asserted claims of the three patents, and ruled that the asserted claims of two of the patents were invalid. In December 2012, the parties filed petitions for review of the initial determination by the ITC. In February 2013, the ITC determined to review in part the initial determination. On review, the ITC determined to terminate the investigation with a finding of no violation. In April 2013, X2Y filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In July 2014, the Federal Circuit affirmed the ITC's finding that Intel's microprocessors did not infringe the X2Y patents. In September 2014, X2Y filed a petition for en banc review, which was denied by the Federal Circuit. In light of this denial by the Federal Circuit, we have concluded that the risk of loss in connection with this matter, if any, is not material to Intel. We continue to dispute the remaining claims and intend to vigorously defend against them. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 26: Operating Segments and Geographic Information  Our operating segments in effect as of December 27, 2014 include: ##TABLE_START  PC Client Group   All other  Data Center Group   Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group  Internet of Things Group   Netbook Group  Mobile and Communications Group   New Devices Group  Software and services operating segments    McAfee    Software and Services Group   ##TABLE_ENDIn the first three months of 2014, we formed the Internet of Things Group, which includes platforms and software optimized for the Internet of Things market segment. Additionally, we changed our organizational structure to align with our critical objectives, which changed information that our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. After the reorganization, we have nine operating segments: PC Client Group (PCCG), Data Center Group (DCG), Internet of Things Group (IOTG), Mobile and Communication Group (MCG), McAfee, Software and Services Group, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group, Netbook Group, and New Devices Group. All prior-period amounts have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect these operating segment changes, as well as other minor reorganizations. The CODM is our CEO. The CODM allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about its revenue and operating income (loss). We manage our business activities primarily based on a product segmentation basis. PCCG, DCG, and MCG are our reportable operating segments. IOTG and the aggregated \"software and services operating segments,\" as shown in the preceding operating segment list, do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. Our Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group, Netbook Group, and New Devices Group operating segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments and their combined results are included within the \"all other\" category. In November 2014, we announced the implementation of a new operating structure. Our new structure reflects our strategy to address all aspects of the client computing market segment and utilize our intellectual property to offer compelling solutions. The new operating structure ensures that we are able to respond to market demand, while reducing costs through efficiencies and products targeted for the client computing market segment. As a result of the implementation of our new operating structure, all prior-period amounts will be adjusted retrospectively to reflect the new organizational structure expected to become effective in the first quarter of 2015. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Revenue for our reportable and aggregated non-reportable operating segments is primarily related to the following product lines: ##TABLE_START  PC Client Group . Includes platforms designed for the notebook (including Ultrabook  devices), 2 in 1 systems, the desktop (including all-in-ones and high-end enthusiast PCs), and tablets; wireless and wired connectivity products; as well as home gateway and set-top box components. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Data Center Group. Includes server, network, and storage platforms designed for the enterprise, cloud, communications infrastructure, and technical computing segments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Internet of Things Group. Includes platforms designed for embedded market segments, including retail, transportation, industrial, and buildings and home, along with a broad range of other market segments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Mobile and Communications Group. Includes platforms designed for the tablet and smartphone market segments; and mobile communications components such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth  technology, global navigation satellite systems, and power management chips. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Software and services operating segments. Includes software products for endpoint security, network and content security, risk and compliance, and consumer and mobile security from our McAfee business, and software products and services that promote Intel architecture as the platform of choice for software development. ##TABLE_END We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments, and the expenses are included in the following operating results. The \"all other\" category includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as: ##TABLE_START  results of operations from our Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group, Netbook Group, and New Devices Group; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  amounts included within restructuring and asset impairment charges; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a portion of profit-dependent compensation and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  divested businesses for which discrete operating results are not regularly reviewed by our CODM; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives, including our foundry business; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. ##TABLE_END The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. As our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segments operating income (loss) results. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Except for these differences, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on managements evaluation (with the participation of our CEO and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 27, 2014 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 27, 2014 , the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( 2013 framework ). Managements assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst  Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting, as stated in the firms attestation report, which is included at the end of Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END Company Overview We are a leader in the design and manufacturing of advanced integrated digital technology platforms. A platform consists of a microprocessor and chipset, and may be enhanced by additional hardware, software, and services. We sell these platforms primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs), and industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries . Our platforms are used across the compute continuum, in notebooks (including Ultrabook  devices), 2 in 1 systems, desktops, servers, tablets, phones, and the Internet of Things (including wearables, retail devices, and manufacturing devices). We also develop and sell software and services primarily focused on security and technology integration. We were incorporated in California in 1968 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1989. Company Strategy Our vision is if it is smart and connected, it is best with Intel  . As a result, our strategy is to offer complete and connected platform computing solutions, consisting of both hardware and software, and to continue to drive \"Moores Law.\" Through enhanced energy-efficient performance, connectivity, and security, we enable platform solutions that span the compute continuum, from high-performance computing systems running trillions of operations per second to embedded applications consuming milliwatts of power. The boundaries of computing itself are expanding, with billions of devices connected to the Internet and to one another. Computing is becoming increasingly personal and enhancing nearly all aspects of life, an evolution that we refer to as the \"personalization of compute.\" As the personalization of compute continues, we believe the following three key assumptions are critical to our strategy: ##TABLE_START  sensification of compute - as computing becomes increasingly personal, users will demand that it capture the human senses such as sight, sound, and touch; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  smart and connected - more and more devices will be able to process data and connect to the cloud, other devices, or people; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extension of you - increasingly personal digital devices and their many form factors will become even more ubiquitous in our lives. ##TABLE_END 1 These assumptions drive us to develop complete and connected platform solutions and compelling user experiences. These assumptions also drive synergistic growth in our Data Center Group, Internet of Things Group, and Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group operating segments. ##TABLE_START As more devices become smart and connected, specifically in the Internet of Things (IOT), there is greater demand for data centers to not only connect these devices, but also to capture and analyze the data they create. In addition, improvements in memory technology are enabling faster and more efficient microprocessors. We call the cycle of growth that occurs as these three market segments feed each other the Virtuous Cycle of Growth. As we execute to our strategy, these market segments will continue to have greater impact on our results and our future as a company. We expect that our acquisition of Altera Corporation (Altera), completed subsequent to fiscal year-end 2015, will benefit this cycle of growth. The Altera acquisition is an example of our efforts to expand our reach within the compute continuum, as we believe that combining our leading-edge products and manufacturing process with Altera's leading field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology will enable new classes of platforms that meet customer needs in the data center and Internet of Things market segments. Virtuous Cycle of Growth ##TABLE_ENDTo succeed in this changing computing environment, we have the following key objectives: ##TABLE_START  relentlessly pursue Moore's Law to maximize and extend our manufacturing technology leadership; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  strive to ensure that Intel  technology is the best choice across the compute continuum and across any operating system; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  enable smart and connected devices through continued development of industry-leading communications and connectivity technology; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expand platforms into adjacent market segments to bring compelling new platform solutions and user experiences to form factors across the compute continuum; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increase the utilization of our investments in intellectual property and research and development (RD) across all market segments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expand the data center, the Internet of Things, and next-generation memory; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  scale our manufacturing capabilities into foundry; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  strive to increase the diversity and inclusion of our workforce, reduce the environmental footprint of our products and operations, and be an asset to the communities where we conduct business. ##TABLE_END We use our core assets to meet these objectives. We believe that applying our core assets to our key objectives provides us with the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers needs quickly. Our core assets and key objectives include the following: ##TABLE_START  Silicon and Manufacturing Technology Leadership. We have long been a leader in silicon process technology and manufacturing, and we aim to continue our lead through investment and innovation in this critical area. Intel co-founder Gordon Moore predicted, in what has become known as Moore's Law, that transistor density on integrated circuits would double about every two years. We continue executing to Moores Law by enabling new devices with higher functionality and complexity while controlling power, cost, and size. In keeping with Moore's Law, we drive a regular and predictable upgrade cycleintroducing the next generation of silicon process technology approximately every two to three years. Through this cycle, we continue to push progress by designing and putting transistor innovations into high-volume production. We aim to have the best process technology, and unlike many semiconductor companies, we primarily manufacture our products in our own facilities. This in-house manufacturing capability enables us to optimize performance, shorten our time-to-market, and scale new products more rapidly. We believe this competitive advantage will be extended in the future as the costs to build leading-edge fabrication facilities increase, and as fewer semiconductor companies will be able to leverage platform design and manufacturing. ##TABLE_END 2 ##TABLE_START  Architecture and Platforms. We believe that users want consistent computing experiences and interoperable devices, and that users and developers value consistency of a standardized architecture. This standardized architecture provides a common framework that results in shortened time-to-market, increased innovation, and the ability to leverage technologies across multiple form factors. We have an advantage over most competitors because we are able to share intellectual property across our platforms and operating segments, which reduces our costs and provides a higher return on capital in our growth market segments (e.g., the data center, Internet of Things, and memory) . The combination of our shared intellectual property portfolio and our interchangeable manufacturing and assembly and test assets allows us to seamlessly shift our production capabilities to respond to market demand. We believe that we can meet the needs of users and developers by offering complete solutions across the compute continuum through our partnership with the industry on open, standards-based platform innovation around Intel  architecture. We continue to invest in improving Intel architecture to deliver increased value to our customers and expand the capabilities of the architecture in adjacent market segments. For example, we focus on delivering improved energy-efficient performance, which involves balancing higher performance with the lowest power. In addition, the personalization of compute continues to drive our strategy as we focus on technologies such as perceptual computing, which brings exciting experiences through devices that sense, perceive, and interact with the users actions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Software and Services. We offer software and services that provide solutions through a combination of hardware and software for consumer and corporate environments. Additionally, we seek to enable and advance the computing ecosystem by providing development tools and support to assist software developers in creating software applications that take advantage of our platforms. We seek to expedite growth in various market segments through our software offerings. We continue to collaborate with companies to develop software platforms that are optimized for Intel  processors, and that support multiple hardware architectures and operating systems. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Security . Through our expertise in hardware and software, we are able to embed security into many facets of computing and bring unique hardware, software, and end-to-end security solutions to the market. We offer proactive solutions and services to help secure the worlds most critical systems and networks. Additionally, through our McAfee  security products, we protect consumers and businesses of all sizes by helping detect and eliminate ever-evolving security threats. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Customer Orientation. We focus on providing compelling user experiences by developing our next generation of products based on customer needs and expectations. In turn, our products help enable the design and development of new user experiences, form factors, and usage models for businesses and consumers. For example, we enhance the computing experience by providing Intel  RealSense  technology, password elimination, and our next-generation Thunderbolt  3 technology. Our latest Thunderbolt technology significantly increases the speed at which data and video can be transferred on a single cable, while simultaneously supplying power. We offer platforms that incorporate various components and capabilities designed and configured to work together to provide an optimized solution that customers can easily integrate into their products. Additionally, we have entered into strategic partnerships across multiple industries with a variety of manufacturers, including: Microsoft Corporation; Fossil Group, Inc.; LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE; SMS Audio, LLC; Opening Ceremony, LLC; and others. Furthermore, we promote industry standards that we believe will yield innovation and improved technologies for users. ##TABLE_END 3 ##TABLE_START  Acquisitions and Strategic Investments. In Q1 2016, we completed the acquisition of Altera. Altera is a global semiconductor company that designs and sells programmable semiconductors and related products, including programmable logic deviceswhich incorporate FPGAs and complex programmable logic devicesand highly integrated System-on-Chip (SoC) devices. As a result of the acquisition, we expect to integrate approximately 3,000 Altera employees. The acquisition of Altera reflects our strategy to drive Moore's Law and fuel growth in the data center and Internet of Things market segments. As we develop future platforms, the integration of PLDs into our platform solutions will improve the overall performance and lower the cost of ownership for our customers. Additionally, we make investments in companies around the world that we believe will further our vision, mission, and strategic objectives; support our key business initiatives; and generate financial returns. Our investmentsincluding those made through Intel Capitalgenerally focus on companies and initiatives that we believe will stimulate growth in the digital economy, create new business opportunities for Intel, and expand global markets for our products. During 2015, we invested $966 million in Beijing UniSpreadtrum Technology Ltd. (UniSpreadtrum), a holding company under Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. (an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co. Ltd.), to, among other things, jointly develop Intel architecture-based and communications-based solutions for phones. Additionally, we plan to continue to purchase and license intellectual property to support our current and expanding business. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Corporate Responsibility. Diversity and inclusion are integral parts of Intel's competitive strategy and vision. In January 2015, Intel announced the Diversity in Technology initiative, setting a goal to achieve higher representation of women and underrepresented minorities in Intel's U.S. workforce by 2020. We are also investing $300 million to help build the STEM pipeline, to support hiring and retaining more women and underrepresented minorities, and to fund programs to support more positive representation within the technology and gaming industries. We are committed to empowering people and expanding economic opportunity through education and technology, driven by our corporate and Intel Foundation programs, policy leadership, and collaborative engagements. In addition, we strive to cultivate an inclusive work environment in which engaged, energized employees can thrive in their jobs and in their communities. We work to develop energy-efficient technology solutions that can be used to address major global problems while reducing our environmental impact. We have also led the industry on the \"conflict minerals\" issue and have worked extensively since 2008 to put in place processes and systems to develop ethical sourcing of tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold for Intel and to prevent profits from the sale of those minerals from funding conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. ##TABLE_END We strive to strengthen our competitive position as we enter and expand into adjacent market segments. These market segments change rapidly, and we need to adapt to new environments. A key characteristic of these adjacent market segments is low power consumption based on SoC products. We are making significant investments in this area with the accelerated development of our SoC solutions based on the 64-bit Intel  Atom  microarchitecture and Intel  Quark  technology. We are also optimizing our server products for energy-efficient performance, as we believe that increased Internet traffic and the use of mobile devices, the Internet of Things, and data center applications have created the need for improved data center infrastructure and energy efficiency. Business Organization In Q1 2015, we made changes in our organizational structure to reflect our strategy to address all aspects of the client computing market segment and utilize our intellectual property to offer compelling customer solutions. As of December 26, 2015 , we manage our business through the following operating segments: For a description of our operating segments, see \" Note 26: Operating Segments and Geographic Information \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Products Platforms We offer platforms that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package. A platform may be enhanced by additional hardware, software, and services. A microprocessorthe central processing unit (CPU) of a computer systemprocesses system data and controls other devices in the system. We offer microprocessors with one or multiple processor cores. Multi-core microprocessors can enable improved multitasking and energy-efficient performance by distributing computing tasks across two or more cores. In addition, many of our processor families integrate graphics functionality onto the processor die. A chipset sends data between the microprocessor and input, display, and storage devices, such as the keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard drive or solid-state drive, and optical disc drives. Chipsets extend the audio, video, and other capabilities of many systems and perform essential logic functions, such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks. We offer and continue to develop SoC products that integrate our CPUs with other system components, such as graphics, audio, imaging, communication and connectivity, and video, onto a single chip. SoC products are designed to reduce total cost of ownership, provide improved performance due to higher integration and the lowest power, and enable form factors such as tablets, phones, Ultrabook devices, and 2 in 1 systems, as well as notebooks, desktops, data center products, and the Internet of Things. We offer a multichip package that integrates the chipset on one die, with the CPU and graphics on another die, connected via a lower-power, on-package interface. Similar to an SoC, the multichip package can provide improved performance due to higher integration coupled with the lowest power consumption, which enables smaller form factors. In 2015, we released our 6th generation Intel  Core  processor, formerly code-named Skylake. We also offer features designed to improve our platform capabilities, such as: ##TABLE_START  Intel vPro technology, a solution for manageability, security, and business user experiences in the notebook, desktop, and 2 in 1 systems and select Internet of Things market segments. Intel vPro technology is designed to provide businesses with increased manageability, upgradeability, energy-efficient performance, and security while lowering the total cost of ownership; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Intel RealSense technology, whichin conjunction with the latest Intel processorsenables a device to perceive depth similar to how a person does. This technology brings new opportunities for the personalization of compute to evolve; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  True Key  technology, which allows users to access devices through facial recognition and other biometric technologies, thereby eliminating the need for log-in passwords. ##TABLE_END 6 We offer a range of platforms based upon the following microprocessors: Intel Security Products Through our McAfee products, we deliver innovative solutions that secure computers, mobile devices, and networks.

In 2015, we released the 6th generation Intel Core processor family for use in notebooks and desktops. These processors use 14-nanometer (nm) transistors and our Tri-Gate transistor technology. Our Tri-Gate transistor technology extends Moores Law by providing improved performance and energy efficiency. In combination, these enhancements can provide significant power savings and performance gains when compared to previous-generation processors. In mobile communications, we expanded our product portfolio with the release of our Intel  Atom  x5 and x7 processors, formerly code named Cherry Trail and designed for mainstream and premium tablet platforms. These processors may be paired with our second-generation 4G LTE solution, featuring CAT6 and carrier aggregation. We also released our Intel  Atom  x3 processor, formerly coded named SoFIA 3G, our first integrated baseband and SoC application processor designed for entry and value phone and tablet platforms. Notebook Our strategy for the notebook computing market segment is to offer notebook technologies designed to bring exciting new user experiences to life and improve performance, battery life, wireless connectivity, manageability, and security. In addition, we design for innovative smaller, lighter, and thinner form factors. Our 6th generation Intel Core processor continues to deliver or enable increasing levels of performance, graphics, and energy efficiency, and will provide our customers and end users with multiple choices in processor cores, graphic performance, and battery life. We have worked to help our customers develop a new class of personal computing devices that includes Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems. These computers combine the energy-efficient performance and capabilities of todays notebooks and tablets with enhanced graphics and improved user interfaces such as touch and voice in thin, light form factors that are highly responsive and secure, and that can seamlessly connect to the Internet. We believe the renewed innovation in the PC industry that we fostered with Ultrabook devices and expanded to 2 in 1 systems will continue. Desktop Our strategy for the desktop computing market segment is to offer exciting new user experiences and products that provide increased manageability, security, and energy-efficient performance. For example, in 2015 we introduced a new user experience in the Intel  Compute Stick, a device that allows users to transform HDMI-capable monitors or TVs into complete computers to get the most out of their display devices. We also focus on lowering the total cost of ownership for businesses. The desktop computing market segment includes all-in-one products, which combine traditionally separate desktop components into one form factor. Additionally, all-in-one computers have transformed into portable and flexible form factors that offer users increased portability and new multi-user applications and uses. For desktop consumers, we also focus on the design of products for high-end enthusiast PCs and mainstream PCs with rapidly increasing audio and media capabilities. Our Data Center Group (DCG) operating segment offers products designed to provide leading energy-efficient performance for all server, network, and storage platforms. In addition, DCG focuses on lowering the total cost of ownership and on other specific optimizations for the enterprise, cloud, communications infrastructure, and technical computing segments. In 2015, we launched the Intel  Xeon  processor D family, our first Intel Xeon processor-based SoC product family, which extends our portfolio for network, storage, and high-density servers. In addition, we launched the Intel Xeon processor E7 v3 family, targeted at platforms requiring four or more CPUs; this processor family delivers performance advancements over previous generations, along with industry-leading reliability, availability, and serviceability. We also released the Intel Xeon processor E3 v5 family on our 14nm process technology, targeted for entry-level servers and workstations. In 2016, we expect to release our next-generation Intel Xeon E5 and E7 families on our 14nm process technology. Additionally, we expect to release in 2016 our next-generation Intel  Xeon Phi  product family, code-named \"Knights Landing,\" with up to 72 high-performance Intel processor cores, integrated memory and fabric, and a common software programming model with Intel Xeon processors. Knights Landing is designed for highly parallel compute- and memory bandwidth-intensive workloads. Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors are positioned to increase the performance of supercomputers, enabling trillions of calculations per second, and to address emerging data analytics solutions. Our Internet of Things  Group (IOTG) operating segment offers platforms designed for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings and home use, along with a broad range of other market segments. In addition, IOTG focuses on establishing an end-to-end manageable architecture that captures actionable information for consumers. In 2015, we announced three new Intel Quark processors, including the Intel  Quark  SE SoC and the Intel Quark microcontrollers D1000 and D2000. Our software and services operating segments seek to create differentiated user experiences on Intel  -based platforms. We differentiate by combining Intel platform features with enhanced software and services, and partnering closely with the external software developer ecosystem. Our three primary initiatives are: ##TABLE_START  enabling platforms that can be used across multiple operating systems, applications, and services across all Intel products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  optimizing features and performance by enabling the software ecosystem to quickly take advantage of new platform features and capabilities; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  protecting consumers, small businesses, and enterprises from malware and emerging online threats. ##TABLE_END 9 Revenue by Major Operating Segment Net revenue for the Client Computing Group (CCG) operating segment, the Data Center Group (DCG) operating segment, the Internet of Things Group (IOTG) operating segment, and the aggregated software and services (SSG) operating segments is presented as a percentage of our consolidated net revenue. SSG includes Intel Security Group and the Software and Services Group operating segments. The \"all other\" category consists primarily of revenue from the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG) and the New Devices Group operating segments. Percentage of Revenue by Major Operating Segment (Dollars in Millions) Percentage of Revenue by Principal Product from Reportable Segments (Dollars in Millions) Competition The computing industry continuously evolves with new and enhanced technologies and products from existing and new providers. The marketplace can change quickly in response to the introduction of such technologies and products and other factors such as changes in customer and end-user requirements, expectations, and preferences. As technologies evolve and new market segments emerge, the boundaries between the market segments that we compete in are also subject to change. Intel faces significant competition in the development and market acceptance of our products in this environment. Our platforms, based on Intel architecture, are positioned to compete across the compute continuum, from the lowest power and mobile devices to the most powerful data center servers. Our platforms, which have integrated hardware and software, offer customers benefits such as ease of use, savings in total cost of ownership, and the ability to scale systems to accommodate increased usage. Competitors We compete against other companies that make and sell platforms, other silicon components, and software to businesses that build and sell computing and communications devices to end users. Our competitors also include companies that sell goods and services to businesses that use them for their internal and/or customer-facing processes (e.g., businesses running large data centers). In addition, we face competition from OEMs, ODMs, and other industrial and communications equipment manufacturers that, to some degree, choose to vertically integrate their own proprietary semiconductor and software assets. By doing so, these competitors may be attempting to offer greater differentiation in their products and to increase their share of the profits for each finished product they sell. Continuing changes in industry participants through, for example, acquisitions or business collaborations could also have a significant impact on our competitive position. In the PC market segment, we are a leading provider of platforms for traditional desktops and notebooks. We face existing and emerging competition in these product areas. Tablets, phones, and other mobile devices offered by numerous vendors are significant competitors to traditional PCs for many usages. We are relatively recent providers of platforms for tablets and phones, and face strong competition from vendors that use applications processors based on the ARM* architecture; feature low-power, long battery-life operation; and are built in SoC formats that integrate numerous functions on one chip. In the data center market segment, we are a leading provider of data center platforms and face competition from companies using ARM architecture or other technologies. Internet cloud computing, storage, and networking are areas of significant targeted growth for us in the data center segment, and we face strong competition in these market segments. In the Internet of Things market segment, we have a long-standing position as a supplier of components and software for embedded products. This marketplace continues to significantly expand with increasing types and numbers of smart and connected devices for industrial, commercial, and consumer uses such as wearables. As this market segment evolves, we face numerous large and small incumbent competitors as well as new entrants that use ARM architecture and other operating systems and software. Our security business operates in highly competitive, fragmented, and rapidly changing market segments. We are a major provider of cybersecurity products and services to both businesses and consumers. For businesses, we compete with companies selling individual point security products and companies selling multiple security products. We offer to businesses a portfolio of products that are integrated into a comprehensive security solution. For consumers, we primarily compete against other major security companies and providers of free security products. Our consumer offerings are designed to protect user data, identity, and devices across the compute continuum. In the memory market segment, we compete against other providers of NAND flash memory products. We focus our efforts primarily on incorporating NAND flash memory into solution products, such as solid-state drives supporting consumer and enterprise applications. We believe that our memory offerings, including innovative developments such as 3D XPoint technology, will complement our other product offerings in our other segments. Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, innovative design, features, price, quality, reliability, brand recognition, technical support, and availability. The importance of these factors varies by the type of end system for the products. For example, performance might be among the most important factors for our products for data center servers, while price and integration might be among the most important factors for our products for tablets, phones, and other mobile devices. Competitive Advantages Our key competitive advantages include: ##TABLE_START  Transitions to next-generation technologies . We have a market lead in transitioning to the next-generation process technology and bringing products to market using such technology. Our products utilizing our 14nm process technology are in the market and we are continuing to work on the development of our next-generation 10nm process technology. We believe that these advancements will offer significant improvements in one or more of the following areas: performance, new features, energy efficiency, and cost. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Combination of our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities with our global architecture design teams . We have made significant capital and RD investments into our integrated manufacturing network, which enables us to have more direct control over our design, development, and manufacturing processes; quality control; product cost; production timing; performance; power consumption; and manufacturing yield. The increased cost of constructing new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers has led to a reduced number of companies that can build and equip leading-edge manufacturing facilities. Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries and subcontractors for manufacturing and assembly and test needs. We provide foundry services as an alternative to such foundries. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Products optimized to operate on multiple operating systems . Through our collaboration with our customers and other third parties, many of our products can operate on multiple operating systems in end-user products and platforms. ##TABLE_END Manufacturing and Assembly and Test As of December 26, 2015 , 55% of our wafer fabrication, including microprocessors and chipsets, was conducted within the U.S. at our facilities in Arizona, Oregon, and New Mexico. Our Massachusetts fabrication facility was our last manufacturing facility on 200 millimeter (mm) wafers and ceased production in Q1 2015. The remaining 45% of our wafer fabrication was conducted outside the U.S. at our facilities in Ireland, Israel, and China. Our fabrication facility in Ireland has transitioned to our 14nm process technology, with manufacturing continuing to ramp in 2016. Wafer fabrication conducted within and outside the U.S. may be impacted by the timing of a facilitys transition to a newer process technology, as well as a facilitys capacity utilization. As of December 26, 2015 , we manufactured our products in wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations: ##TABLE_START Products  Wafer Size  Process Technology  Locations Microprocessors and other products  300mm  14nm  Arizona, Oregon, Ireland Microprocessors and other products  300mm  22nm  Israel, Arizona, Oregon Microprocessors and chipsets  300mm  32nm  New Mexico Microprocessors  300mm  45nm  New Mexico Microprocessors and chipsets  300mm  65nm  China ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 26, 2015 , our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers, with a substantial majority manufactured using our 14nm, 22nm, and 32nm process technologies. As we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology, we incur significant start-up costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing. However, continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs. The benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor, reducing heat output from each transistor, and increasing the number of integrated features on each chip. These advancements can enable us to introduce new devices with higher functionality and complexity while controlling power, cost, and size. In addition, with each shift to a new process technology, we are able to produce more microprocessors per square foot of our wafer fabrication facilities. The costs to develop newer process technologies are significantly less than adding capacity by building additional wafer fabrication facilities using older process technologies. We use third-party foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components, including communications, connectivity, and networking products. For example, the Intel Atom x3 processor is fabricated by a third-party foundry. In addition, we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture board-level products and systems. We purchase certain communications and connectivity products from external vendors primarily in the Asia-Pacific region. Following the manufacturing process, the majority of our components are subject to assembly and test. We perform our components assembly and test at facilities in Malaysia, China, and Vietnam . To augment capacity, we use subcontractors to perform assembly and test of certain products, primarily chipsets and communications and connectivity products. Our NAND flash memory products are manufactured by IMFT and Micron using 20nm or 25nm process technology, and assembly and test of these products is performed by Micron and other external subcontractors. For further information, see \" Note 5: Cash and Investments \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Additionally, in the second half of 2016, we will start using our facility in Dalian, China to help expand our manufacturing capacity in next-generation memory. The expansion is part of our multi-source supply strategy and will allow us to best serve our customers. Our employment and operating practices are consistent with, and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by, local country law. Intel expects all suppliers to comply with our Code of Conduct and the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct, both of which set standards that address the rights of workers to safe and healthy working conditions, environmental responsibility, compliance with privacy and data security obligations, and compliance with applicable laws. We have thousands of suppliers, including subcontractors, providing our various materials, equipment, and service needs. We set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments and audits. We communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources, but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country. In those cases, we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply. We have entered into long-term contracts with certain suppliers to help ensure a stable supply of silicon and semiconductor manufacturing tools. Our products are typically manufactured at multiple Intel facilities around the world or by subcontractors. However, some products are manufactured in only one Intel or subcontractor facility, and we seek to implement action plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility. See \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Research and Development We are committed to investing in world-class technology development, particularly in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits. RD expenditures were $12.1 billion in 2015 ( $11.5 billion in 2014 and $10.6 billion in 2013 ). Our RD activities are directed toward the delivery of solutions consisting of hardware and software platforms and supporting services across a wide range of computing devices. We are focused on developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products, which will in turn enable new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers. We focus our RD efforts on advanced computing technologies, developing new microarchitectures, advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology, delivering the next generation of platforms, improving our platform initiatives, developing new solutions in emerging technologies (including memory and the Internet of Things), and developing software solutions and tools. Our RD efforts are intended to enable new levels of performance and address areas such as energy efficiency, system-level integration, security, scalability for multi-core architectures, system manageability, and ease of use. As part of our RD efforts, we plan to introduce a new Intel Core microarchitecture for desktops, notebooks (including Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems), and Intel Xeon processors on a regular cadence. We expect to lengthen the amount of time we will utilize our 14nm and our next-generation 10nm process technologies, further optimizing our products and process technologies while meeting the yearly market cadence for product introductions. Advances in our silicon technology have enabled us to continue making Moores Law a reality. In 2014, we began manufacturing our 5th generation Intel Core processor family using our 14nm process technology. In 2015, we released a new microarchitecture (our 6th generation Intel Core processor family), using our 14nm process technology. We also plan to introduce a third 14nm product, code-named \"Kaby Lake.\" This product will have key performance enhancements as compared to our 6th generation Intel Core processor family. We are also developing 10nm manufacturing process technology, our next-generation process technology. We have continued expanding on the advances anticipated by Moores Law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products optimized for a wider variety of applications. We expect these advances will result in a significant reduction in transistor leakage, lower active power, and an increase in transistor density to enable more smaller form factors, such as powerful, feature-rich phones and tablets with a longer battery life. For instance, we have accelerated the Intel Atom processor-based SoC roadmap for our mobile form factors (including tablets and phones), notebooks (including Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems), the Internet of Things, and data center applications, on our 32nm, 22nm, and 14nm process technologies. In addition, we offer the Intel  Quark SoC, an ultra-low-power and low-cost architecture designed for the Internet of Things such as industrial machines and wearable devices. With our continued focus on silicon and manufacturing technology leadership, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) in 2012, certain of which were amended in 2014 to further define the commercial terms between the parties. These amended agreements, in which Intel agreed to provide RD funding over five years, are intended to accelerate the development of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography projects and deep ultraviolet immersion lithography projects, including generic developments applicable to both 300mm and 450mm. Our RD activities range from designing and developing new products and manufacturing processes to researching future technologies and products. We continue to make significant RD investments in the development of SoC devices to enable growth in mobile form factors. In addition, we continue to make significant investments in communications and connectivity for tablets, phones, and other connected devices, including multimode LTE modems. Our investment in Cloudera, Inc. (Cloudera), completed in 2014, is evidence of our drive to bring big data analytics to the mainstream market through the joining of Cloudera's software platform and our data center architecture based on Intel Xeon processors. We also continue to invest in leading-edge foundry platforms and ecosystem partner development, graphics, high-performance computing, and communication and connectivity. Our RD model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies, leading standards initiatives, and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies, including joint pathfinding conducted between researchers at Intel Labs and our business groups. We centrally manage key cross-business group product initiatives to align and prioritize our RD activities across these groups. In addition, we may augment our RD activities by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar RD focus areas, as well as directly purchasing or licensing technology applicable to our RD initiatives. To drive innovation and gain efficiencies, we intend to utilize our investments in intellectual property and RD across our market segments. Employees As of December 26, 2015 , we had 107,300 employees worldwide, with approximately 51% of those employees located in the U.S. Sales and Marketing Customers We sell our products primarily to OEMs and ODMs. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, we sell our products to other manufacturers, including makers of a wide range of industrial and communications equipment. Our customers also include those who buy PC components and our other products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customerssystems builders that purchase Intel  microprocessors and other products from our distributors. We have a program that allows distributors to sell our microprocessors and other products in small quantities to customers of systems builders. Our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets. Hewlett-Packard Company, our largest customer in 2014, separated into HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company on November 1, 2015. In 2015, these entities collectively accounted for 18% of our net revenue ( 18% in 2014 and 17% in 2013 ), Dell Inc. accounted for 15% of our net revenue ( 16% in 2014 and 15% in 2013 ), and Lenovo Group Limited accounted for 13% of our net revenue ( 12% in 2014 and 12% in 2013 ). No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue during such periods. For information about net revenue and operating income by operating segment, and net revenue from unaffiliated customers by country, see \" Note 26: Operating Segments and Geographic Information \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Sales Arrangements Our products are sold through sales offices throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, private-label branding, and other matters. Our sales are routinely made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology. Our products are generally shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer, even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related cost of sales is deferred. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, usually 30 days after shipment or delivery. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. For information about our allowance for doubtful receivables, see \"Schedule IIValuation and Qualifying Accounts\" in Part IV of this Form 10-K. Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. We have the option to grant credit for, repair, or replace defective products, and there is no contractual limit on the amount of credit that may be granted to a distributor for defective products. Distribution Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers. Backlog Over time, our larger customers have generally moved to lean-inventory or just-in-time operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products. As our customers continue to lower their inventories, our processes to fulfill their orders have evolved to meet their needs. As a result, our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance non-binding commitments from customers as to future purchases. Our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Only a small portion of our orders are non-cancelable, and the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant. Seasonal Trends Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. Marketing Our global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known Intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel Quark, Intel Atom, Intel  Celeron  , Intel  Pentium  , Intel Xeon, Intel Xeon Phi, and Intel  Itanium  trademarks make up our processor brands. We promote brand awareness and preference, and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and press relations. We market to consumer and business audiences, and focus on building awareness and generating demand for new form factors such as tablets, all-in-one devices, and 2 in 1 systems powered by Intel. Our key messaging focuses on increased performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as connectivity, communications, and security. Purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the Intel Inside  program. This program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Through the Intel Inside program, certain customers are licensed to place Intel  logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel  brands, subject to customers meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers. Intellectual Property Rights and Licensing Intel owns significant intellectual property (IP) and related IP rights around the world that relate to our products, services, RD, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress rights, and maskwork rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. Such efforts can be difficult, however, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right. See \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A, and \" Note 25: Contingencies \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We have obtained patents in the U.S. and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, and the comparative pace of governments patenting processes, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire; in some cases, our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are granted. As we expand our products into new industries, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products. In addition to developing patents based on our own RD efforts, we purchase patents from third parties to supplement our patent portfolio. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other IP, may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our component-level and platform products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. Compliance with Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations Our compliance efforts focus on monitoring regulatory and resource trends and setting company-wide performance targets for key resources and emissions. These targets address several parameters, including product design; chemical, energy, and water use; waste recycling; the source of certain minerals used in our products; climate change; and emissions. As a company, we focus on reducing natural resource use, the solid and chemical waste by-products of our manufacturing processes, and the environmental impact of our products. We currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety (EHS) laws and regulations. Over the past several years, we have significantly reduced the use of lead and halogenated flame retardants in our products and manufacturing processes. We work with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), OEMs, and retailers to help manage e-waste (including electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives) and to promote recycling. The European Union requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that let consumers return products for recycling. Many U.S. states and countries in Latin America and Asia also have or are developing similar e-waste take-back laws. Although these laws are typically targeted at the end electronic product and not components such as microprocessors, the inconsistency of many e-waste take-back laws, changes in our product offerings, and the lack of local e-waste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts. We are an industry leader in our efforts to build ethical sourcing of minerals for our products, including \"conflict minerals\" from the DRC and adjoining countries. In 2013, we accomplished our goal to manufacture microprocessors that are DRC conflict-free for tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold. We continue our work to establish DRC conflict-free supply chains for our company and our industry, and are moving beyond microprocessors to validate our broader product base as DRC conflict-free in 2016 for these four minerals. We seek to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers to improve energy efficiency. We take a holistic approach to power management, addressing the challenge at the silicon, package, circuit, microarchitecture, macroarchitecture, platform, and software levels. We recognize that climate change may cause general economic risk. For further information on the risks of climate change, see \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We see a potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations. This could include items applied to utility companies that are passed along to customers, such as carbon taxes or costs associated with obtaining permits for our manufacturing operations, emission cap and trade programs, or renewable portfolio standards. We are committed to sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives and working proactively with governments, environmental groups, and industry to promote global environmental sustainability. We believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the worlds environmental challenges, and we are joining forces with industry, business, and governments to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to combat climate change. We have been purchasing renewable energy at some of our major sites for several years. We purchase renewable energy certificates under a multi-year contract. This purchase has placed Intel at the top of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Green Power Partnership rankings for the past eight years and is intended to help stimulate the market for green power, leading to additional generating capacity and, ultimately, lower costs.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END The following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and our financial statements and the related notes. Changes in product demand can harm our results of operation and financial condition. Demand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Changes  in the demand for our products may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us to write down the value of our assets. Important factors that could lead to variation in the demand for our products include changes in: ##TABLE_START  business conditions, including downturns in the computing industry, or in the global or regional economies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  consumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the level of our customers inventories; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  customer product needs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing products; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the technology supply chain, including supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. ##TABLE_END We face significant competition. The  industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we do not anticipate and respond to these developments, our competitive position may weaken, and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete. In recent years, our business focus has expanded and now includes the design and production of platforms for tablets, phones, and other devices across the compute continuum, including products for the Internet of Things, and related services. As a result, we face new sources of competition, including, in certain of these market segments, from incumbent competitors with established customer bases and greater brand recognition. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, integration, and energy efficiency of our products, as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain consumer and market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments. To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful RD effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors. For example, we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, including the construction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers. Our RD efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems, and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, and the products we invest in and develop may not be well-received by customers. Our RD investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years, and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. Additionally, the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for, or pricing of, our products. If we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including increased costs and reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets. Changes in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results. Prices differ widely among the platforms we offer in our various market segments due to differences in features offered or manufacturing costs. For example, product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those based on Intel Quark or Intel Atom processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon and Intel Itanium processors. If demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platforms in any of our market segments, our gross margin and revenue would decrease. In addition, when products are introduced, they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross margin. We operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions. Global or regional conditions may harm our financial results. We have manufacturing, assembly and test, RD, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 80% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2015 . As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including: ##TABLE_START  global and local economic conditions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, and terrorist activity; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  natural disasters, public health issues, and other catastrophic events; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  government restrictions on, or nationalization of our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  differing employment practices and labor issues; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  formal or informal imposition of new or revised export and/or import and doing-business regulations, which could be changed without notice; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices. ##TABLE_END We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, which may differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, advertising, employment, environment, health, and safety. Compliance with such requirements may be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, and/or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. We may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as overseas capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations or systems could be disrupted by natural disasters; geopolitical conditions; terrorist activity; public health issues; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation or telecommunications providers; or other catastrophic events. Such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to enable us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions. We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. In addition, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. We operate our own fabrication facilities and, as a result, are vulnerable to manufacturing-related risks. Due to the variability in demand for our products, we may be unable to timely respond to reduce costs when demand declines or to increase production when demand increases. Our operations have high costs that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to manufacturing, such as facility construction and equipment, RD, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. Our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. Factory-planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation. Conversely, if product demand increases, we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand. Our revenue and gross margin can also be affected by the timing of our product introductions and related expenses, including marketing expenses. We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology. We may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. We are continually engaged in the transition from our existing process to the next-generation process technology. This consistent innovation involves significant expense and carries inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process technologies, development and production timing delays, lower than anticipated manufacturing yields, and product defects and errata. Disruptions in the production process can also result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses, interruption in our supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditionsall of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues can lead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand, which could adversely impact our business and the results from operations. We face supply chain risks. Thousands of suppliers provide materials that we use in production and other aspects of our business. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials. However, for certain materials, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. In addition, consolidation among suppliers could impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us. The inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. Production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations. We also rely on third-party providers to manufacture and assemble and test certain components or products, particularly those related to networking, mobile and communications, and NAND flash memory. If any of these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely basis, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions that could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, there are regulatory and other requirements, restrictions, and requests from various constituencies regarding sourcing practices and supplier conduct, with a trend toward expanding the scope of materials and locations where materials originate, regulating supplier behaviors, and increasing the required disclosures regarding such matters by public companies. Increased regulation and public pressure in this area would cause our compliance costs to increase and could negatively affect our reputation given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials, but do not directly control their procurement or employment practices. We are subject to the risks of product defects and errata. Product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) may result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers may also contain defects. Costs from defects and errata could include: ##TABLE_START  writing off some or all of the value of inventory; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  recalling products that have been shipped; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  providing product replacements or modifications; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  defending against resulting litigation. ##TABLE_END These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and result in delay or loss of revenue. Any product defects, errata, or other issues that we do not detect or fix could also damage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay product releases, or result in legal liability. The announcement of product defects and errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of our components or for other reasons. Any of these occurrences could harm our business and financial results. We are subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations. The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of EHS laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in: ##TABLE_START  regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  suspension of production; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  alteration of our fabrication and assembly and test processes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reputational challenges; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  restrictions on our operations or sales. ##TABLE_END Our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements. Environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. For example, climate change regulation could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution control requirements, and increased or new monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. We also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations if, for example, utility companies pass on their costs to their customers. Furthermore, many of our operations are located in semi-arid regions that may become increasingly vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. Our fabrication facilities require significant water use and, while we recycle and reuse a portion of the water used, we may have difficulties obtaining sufficient water to fulfill our operational needs due the lack of available infrastructure. We are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. We may be unable to enforce or protect our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others to protect our IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that the IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to the opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in the other party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. Governments may adopt regulationsand governments or courts may render decisionsrequiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in RD, product development, and marketing could be reduced. Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights. Companies in our industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Our competitors may have licenses to our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses may exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired. Third parties may assert claims based on IP rights against us or our products, which could harm our business. We may face claims based on IP rights from individuals and companies, including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies. We are normally engaged in a number of litigation matters involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, whether or not meritorious, could cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve, and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. In addition, we may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. As a result of IP rights claims, we could: ##TABLE_START  pay monetary damages, including payments to satisfy indemnification obligations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  enter into settlement and license agreements, which agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. ##TABLE_END These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed. We rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of our products include third-party IP and/or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party IP, or to use such IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. We are subject to the risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. We may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. As described in \" Note 25: Contingencies \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and distracting to management. We must attract, retain, and motivate key employees. To be competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based and other performance-based incentive awards such as restricted stock units (RSUs) and cash bonuses. If our share-based or other compensation programs cease to be viewed as competitive and valuable benefits, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. We are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks. Third parties attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network, products, services, and infrastructure. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our information technology (IT) systems. Additionally, malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide. Due to the widespread use of our products and the high profile of our commercial security products, we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others. We believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication. From time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure. To date, none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations. In some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and/or changes or patches to our products and services, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. Such incidents, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, reduced inventory value, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. Publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers or users, and reduce demand for our products and services. We may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. We are subject to risks associated with transactions. We invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments. We make investments in public and private companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. Companies in which we invest range from early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on the availability to the company of additional funding on favorable terms, or a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. If any of the companies in which we invest fail, we could lose all or part of our investment. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment, we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize a loss. Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions could fail to achieve strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and harm our results of operations. In pursuing  our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions, such as joint ventures. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to complete an acquisition has opportunity costs and we may need to forgo the prospect of acquiring other companies or technologies that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. In addition to opportunity costs, these transactions involve large challenges and risks, including risks that: ##TABLE_START  the transaction may not advance our business strategy; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may be unable to identify opportunities on terms acceptable to us; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may not realize a satisfactory return; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may experience disruption of our ongoing operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may be unable to retain key personnel; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may experience difficulty in integrating new employees, business systems, and technology; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  acquired businesses may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our due diligence process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may have difficulty entering new market segments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may be unable to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses; and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  there may be unknown, underestimated, and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities. ##TABLE_END When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed-upon terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expense, or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, resulting in a loss on the transaction. If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to factors such as: ##TABLE_START  failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  IP disputes or other litigation; or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulties obtaining financing for the transaction. ##TABLE_END We are subject to sales-related risks. We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion  of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added resellers, OEMs, ODMs, Internet service providers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors). Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk, and compliance risks. Distributors may sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position. We face risks related to business transactions with U.S. government entities. We receive proceeds from services and products we provide to the U.S. government. U.S. government demand and payment may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations. U.S. government contracts are subject to oversight, including special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, and security. Failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspensions, or debarment from future U.S. government business. Our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies. The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies have a large impact on our results of operations. For more information, see \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. These methods, estimates, and judgments are subject to large risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and changes could affect our results of operations. Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income. A number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including: ##TABLE_START  the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the resolution of issues arising from tax audits; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in available tax credits; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-U.S. income and expenses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. ##TABLE_END We may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases. The amount, timing, and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposessuch as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend paymentsand because of changes in cash flows and changes in tax laws. Workforce restructuring actions may be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our financial results. In response to the business environment and to accomplish our strategic objectives, from time to time we may restructure our operations or make other adjustments to our workforce. Such workforce changes can result in restructuring charges in addition to those described in \" Note 13: Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Such workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity, which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans, or do so within the expected time frame. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls. We do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If our controls become inadequate, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, our reputation may be adversely affected, our business and operating results could be harmed, and the market price of our stock could decline. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

We also completed construction of a large-scale fabrication building in Arizona in 2013. A portion of the new Oregon and Arizona facilities are currently not in use and we are reserving the new buildings for additional capacity and future technologies. Incremental construction and equipment installation are required to ready the facilities for their intended use. Our Massachusetts fabrication facility was our last manufacturing facility on 200mm wafers and ceased production in Q1 2015. Outside the U.S., we have wafer fabrication facilities in Ireland, Israel, and China. Our fabrication facility in Ireland has transitioned to our 14nm process technology, with manufacturing continuing to ramp in 2016.  Additionally, in the second half of 2016, we will start using our facility in Dalian, China to help expand our manufacturing capacity in next-generation memory. Our assembly and test facilities are located in Malaysia, China, and Vietnam . In addition, we have sales and marketing offices worldwide that are generally located near major concentrations of customers. We believe that the facilities described above are suitable and adequate for our present purposes and that the productive capacity in our facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize it.

We continue to see our business evolve as we execute on our strategy to leverage the \"Virtuous Cycle of Growth\" with higher DCG platform, NSG, and IOTG platform revenue. These operating segments made up nearly 40% of our revenue and more than 60% of our operating profit for full year 2015 . DCG and IOTG both posted record net revenue for the quarter and was partially offset by lower CCG platform revenue. We continue to believe that the worldwide PC supply chain is healthy, with appropriate levels of inventory. Gross margin of 64%  decrease d by approximately one percentage point from Q4 2014 , primarily due to higher platform unit costs that resulted in part from a higher mix of 14nm platforms, and lower platform unit sales. These decreases were partially offset by higher platform average selling prices and, to a lesser extent, lower factory start-up costs. Gross margin increased approximately two percentage points compared to the midpoint of the Business Outlook in October 2015, primarily driven by lower platform unit costs, lower factory start-up costs, and higher platform average selling prices. For full year 2015 , our net revenue of $55.4 billion was down  1% from 2014 , operating income of $14.0 billion , was down  9% from 2014 , and diluted earnings per share of $2.33 were up  1% from 2014 . CCG net revenue was down  8% as we continued to see weakness in the macroeconomic environment and, in particular, the PC market as we were coming off of a strong growth rate in the second half of 2014 with the Microsoft Windows* XP refresh. We continue to see growth in DCG, with net revenue up  11% and platform unit sales and average selling prices up 8% and 3% , respectively. Gross margin of 63% was down approximately one point from 2014 , driven by higher platform unit costs on 14nm and lower platform unit sales. These decreases were partially offset by higher platform average selling prices, primarily driven by a higher mix of DCG platforms and higher average selling prices on a richer mix of platforms within the desktop and DCG platforms. To a lesser extent, the decrease in gross margin was also partially offset by lower factory start-up costs on 14nm as well as lower production costs on 14nm, which were treated as a period charge in 2014. Operating profit was $14.0 billion in 2015 , a decrease of $1.3 billion from 2014 , driven by lower gross margin and increased investments in our growth market segments of the data center, Internet of Things, and memory. Our operating profit decrease was partially offset by lower investment in the PC market segment. Our effective tax rate for 2015 of 19.6% decreased 6.3 points from 2014 , driven by one-time items and our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain prior years non-U.S. earnings. The cash generation from our business remained strong, with cash from operations of $19.0 billion in 2015 . During 2015 , we purchased $7.3 billion of capital assets, down $2.8 billion from 2014 . This change was primarily driven by our new strategy on next-generation process technology and manufacturing efficiencies, namely that we extended the length of time we plan to use the 14nm process technology by introducing a third 14nm product, code-named \"Kaby Lake.\" This product will have key performance enhancements as compared to our 6th generation Intel Core processor family. We also returned cash to stockholders by both paying $4.6 billion in dividends and repurchasing $3.0 billion of common stock through our stock repurchase program. We ended the year with an investment portfolio of $25.3 billion , up approximately $11.3 billion from a year ago. That investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets. We issued approximately $9.5 billion of long-term debt to finance our Altera acquisition. For further information, see \" Note 15: Borrowings \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Effective in Q1 2016, our annual dividend increased $0.08 to $1.04 per share and our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of common stock. Early in Q1 2016, we completed the acquisition of Altera. The acquisition will couple Intels leading-edge products and manufacturing process with Alteras leading FPGA technology. The combination is expected to enable new classes of products that meet customer needs in the data center and Internet of Things market segments. We believe our product offerings and architectures will continue to enable innovation and growth in the data center and the Internet of Things market segments. The impact of the Altera acquisition has been reflected in our Business Outlook published in our January 2016 earnings release. For further information, see \" Note 8: Acquisitions \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our Business Outlook for Q1 2016 and full year 2016 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (RD plus MGA), and capital expenditures. We publish our Business Outlook in our quarterly earnings release. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our Business Outlook and any updates thereto are publicly available on our Investor Relations website,  www.intc.com . This Business Outlook is not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.

From the close of business on March 18, 2016 until our quarterly earnings release is published, currently scheduled for April 19, 2016 , we will observe a \"quiet period.\" During the quiet period, the Business Outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our Form 8-K filed on January 14, 2016 , and other forward-looking statements disclosed in the company's news releases and filings with the SEC, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this Form 10-K, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. During the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our Business Outlook or our financial results or expectations. The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion. Critical Accounting Estimates The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: ##TABLE_START  the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity investments, net when we record impairments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the determination of useful lives for our property, plant and equipment and the related timing of when depreciation should begin; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the valuation and allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the valuation and recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment; identified intangibles and goodwill), which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment. ##TABLE_END In the following section, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. Non-Marketable Equity Investments We regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $4.5 billion as of December 26, 2015 ( $3.2 billion as of December 27, 2014 ). Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. Our non-marketable equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success depends on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business factors. The companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings. These events could cause our investments to become impaired. In addition, financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. For further information about our investment portfolio risks, see \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized. The measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment. Qualitative analysis of our investments involves understanding each investees revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects; the technological feasibility of our investees products and technologies; the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; and the management and governance structure of the investee. Quantitative assessments of the fair value of our investments are developed using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as revenue, earnings, comparable performance multiples, recent financing rounds, the terms of investees issued interests, and the level of marketability of the investments. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies sizes, growth rates, industries, and development stages. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates regarding the investees' revenue, costs, and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available market, historical, and forecast data. If the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment. Impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $166 million in 2015 ( $140 million in 2014 and $112 million in 2013 ). Property, Plant and Equipment Depreciation Management judgment is required in determining the estimated economic useful lives of our property, plant and equipment, which can materially impact our depreciation expense. Accordingly, at least annually, we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of these assets. During the assessment performed in Q4 2015, we considered factors such as the lengthening of the process technology cadence resulting in longer node transitions on both 14nm and 10nm products. With those longer transitions, we added a third product to our 14nm roadmap. We have also increased re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As a result, we determined that the useful lives of machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facilities should be increased from four to five years. We will account for this as a change in estimate that will be applied prospectively, effective in Q1 2016. This change in depreciable life drives approximately $1.5 billion in lower depreciation expense for 2016. Approximately half of this benefit will increase gross margin (impacting both unit cost and start-up costs), approximately one-fourth will decrease RD expenses, and the remaining one-fourth will result in lower inventory costs and ending inventory values. As part of our long-range capacity planning, construction on certain facilities is on hold, and the facilities are not in use. These facilities are being held in a safe state, and we have plans to place them into service at a future date. The time at which these assets are placed into service depends on our existing manufacturing capacity, market demand for specific products, and where we are in the transition of products on our roadmap. Management is required to make judgments as to the timing of when these facilities will be readied for their intended use and placed into service for the manufacturing of our products, which is when depreciation begins. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Business Combinations Accounting for acquisitions requires our management to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired, which involves a number of judgments, assumptions, and estimates that could materially affect the timing or amounts recognized in our financial statements. The items involving the most significant assumptions, estimates, and judgments include determining the fair value of the following: ##TABLE_START  Intangible assets, including valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, and discount rates, as well as the estimated useful life of the intangible assets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the acquired companys brand, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inventory; property, plant and equipment; pre-existing liabilities or legal claims; deferred revenue; and contingent consideration, each as may be applicable, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  goodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. ##TABLE_END We allocate goodwill and intangible assets to the reporting unit(s) based on the reporting unit(s) that are expected to benefit from the business combination. Upon any reorganization of our operating segments, we reevaluate our reporting units and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year following the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Long-Lived Asset Impairments Property, Plant and Equipment We assess property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset groupings carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. We measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset groupings carrying value and its fair value. Property, plant and equipment is considered a non-financial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. Impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets new, shorter useful lives. Based on our analysis, impairments and accelerated depreciation of our property, plant and equipment totaled $151 million in 2015 ( $115 million in 2014 and $172 million in 2013 ). MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Identified Intangibles We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinite-lived intangible assets, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If we determine that an individual asset is impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Based on our impairment assessment, we recognized impairment charges of $7 million in 2015 ( $36 million in 2014 and $17 million in 2013 ). Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component, and are consistent with the operating segments identified in \" Note 26: Operating Segments and Geographic Information \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist , to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value. For reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. Additionally, as part of this assessment, we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting units fair value. For reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform additional analysis. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. If we determine during the second step that the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income method and the market method to estimate a reporting units fair value. The income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following assumptions and inputs: revenue, based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share; estimated costs; and appropriate discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. Our estimates of market segment growth, our market segment share, and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and a variety of external sources. These estimates are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process. The same estimates are also used in planning for our long-term manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process, and for long-term and short-term business planning and forecasting. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data. The market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. A reporting units carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) For the annual impairment assessment in 2015 , we determined that for each of our reporting units with significant amounts of goodwill, it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value. As a result, we concluded that performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary for those reporting units. During the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years, we completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years. Income Taxes We must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not more likely than not, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should a change occur in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery is not more likely than not. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes. We use a two-step process to recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. We have not recognized U.S. deferred income taxes on certain undistributed non-U.S. earnings because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. Remittances of non-U.S. earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our non-U.S. and U.S. operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-U.S. earnings, which would be subject to U.S. income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes. Inventory Intel has a product development life cycle that corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities, and associated costs, change in nature from RD to cost of sales. In order for a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. This milestone is known as product release qualification (PRQ). We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. To determine which costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; therefore, it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges were insignificant in 2015 ( insignificant in 2014 and $319 million in 2013 ). MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, customer acceptance of our products, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. If the estimated market value of the inventory is less than the carrying value, we write down the inventory and record the difference as a charge to cost of sales. Inventory reserves increased by approximately $185 million in 2015 compared to 2014 . The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The demand forecast is utilized in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. The estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin. Loss Contingencies We are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings and asserted and potential claims, accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product defects, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred. The outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims, and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments, are subject to significant uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter, and we may revise our estimates. These revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

Platform unit sales were down  9% due to challenging macroeconomic conditions, particularly in the first half of the year, and higher PC demand in 2014 driven by the Microsoft Windows XP refresh. The decrease in PC demand was partially offset by higher DCG and IOTG platform unit sales. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by higher platform average selling prices, which were up  8% , as we benefited from a higher mix of DCG platform unit sales and higher average selling prices on desktop and DCG platforms. To a lesser extent, the decrease in revenue was partially offset by higher NSG revenue. Our overall gross margin percentage was 62.6% in 2015 , down from 63.7% in 2014 . The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin decrease in the CCG operating segment. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars for 2015 and 2014 from the sale of platforms in the CCG and DCG operating segments. Our overall gross margin dollars in 2015  decreased by $930 million , or 3% , compared to 2014 .

Platform unit sales were up  19% , primarily driven by the ramp of our tablet platform and strength in the traditional PC business. To a lesser extent, higher NSG revenue also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by lower platform average selling prices, which were down  10% primarily on mix shift on significantly higher tablet and phone platform unit sales and cash consideration associated with integrating our tablet and phone platforms. To a lesser extent, lower CCG phone component unit sales partially offset the increase in revenue. Our overall gross margin percentage was 63.7% in 2014 , up from 59.8% in 2013 . The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin increase in the CCG and DCG operating segments. We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars for 2014 and 2013 from the sale of platforms in the CCG and DCG operating segments. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2014 increased by $4.1 billion, or 13%, compared to 2013 .

Restructuring actions related to this program that were approved in 2015 impacted approximately  4,000  employees. We estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately $400 million , which will be realized within RD, cost of sales, and MGA . We began to realize these savings in Q2 2015 and expect to fully realize these savings after the actions are complete. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2013 Restructuring Program . Beginning in Q3 2013, management approved and commenced implementation of several restructuring actions, including targeted workforce reductions and the exit of certain businesses and facilities. These actions include the wind down of our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Massachusetts, which ceased production in Q1 2015, and the closure of our assembly and test facility in Costa Rica, which ceased production in Q4 2014. These targeted reductions will enable us to better align our resources in areas providing the greatest benefit in the current business environment. This program was substantially complete by the end of 2015. Restructuring and asset impairment charges for the 2013 restructuring program for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years Ended (In Millions)  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013 Employee severance and benefit arrangements  $  $  $ Asset impairments and other restructuring charges    Total restructuring and asset impairment charges  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDRestructuring and asset impairment activities for the 2013 restructuring program for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  Employee Severance and Benefits  Asset Impairments and Other  Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 28, 2013  $  $   $ Additional accruals    Adjustments   (1 )  Cash payments  (327 )  (6 )  (333 ) Non-cash settlements    (13 )  (13 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2014    Additional accruals    Adjustments  (19 )  (1 )  (20 ) Cash payments  (171 )  (10 )  (181 ) Non-cash settlements    (3 )  (3 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2015  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDWe recorded the additional accruals and adjustments as restructuring and asset impairment charges in the consolidated statements of income and within the \"all other\" operating segments category.

Restructuring actions related to this program that were approved in 2015 impacted approximately 940  employees. Since Q3 2013, we have incurred a total of  $625 million  in restructuring and asset impairment charges. These charges include $548 million  related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 8,500  employees, and  $77 million  in asset impairment charges and other restructuring charges. We estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately $600 million , which will be realized within RD, MGA, and cost of sales . We began to realize these savings in Q4 2013 and expect to fully realize these savings after the actions are complete. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation totaled $1.3 billion in 2015 ( $1.1 billion in 2014 and $1.1 billion in 2013 ). Share-based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses. As of December 26, 2015 , unrecognized share-based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Unrecognized Share-Based Compensation Costs  Weighted Average Period Restricted stock units  $ 1,789  1.2 years Stock options  $  8 months Stock Purchase Plan  $  2 months ##TABLE_ENDGains (Losses) on Equity Investments and Interest and Other, Net Gains (losses) on equity investments, net and interest and other, net for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years Ended (In Millions)  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013 Gains (losses) on equity investments, net  $  $  $ Interest and other, net  $ (105 )  $  $ (151 ) ##TABLE_ENDWe recognized lower net gains on equity investments in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower gains on sales of equity investments, partially offset by higher gains on third-party merger transactions. We recognized lower net gains on equity investments in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower gains on sales of equity investments, partially offset by higher gains on third-party merger transactions. The majority of gains on sales, net for 2014 resulted from gains on private equity sales. Net gains on equity investments for 2013 included gains of $439 million on the sales of our interest in Clearwire Communications, LLC and our shares in Clearwire Corporation in Q3 2013. For further information on these transactions, see \" Note 5: Cash and Investments \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We recognized an interest and other net loss in 2015 compared to a net gain in 2014 primarily due to higher interest expense, which includes the 2015 issuances of our $9.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. For further information on these transactions, see \" Note 15: Borrowings \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We recognized an interest and other net gain in 2014 compared to a net loss in 2013 due to a gain recognized on the divestiture of our Intel Media assets in 2014. Provision for Taxes Our provision for taxes and effective tax rate for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years Ended (In Millions)  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013 Income before taxes  $ 14,212  $ 15,801  $ 12,611 Provision for taxes  $ 2,792  $ 4,097  $ 2,991 Effective tax rate  19.6 %  25.9 %  23.7 % ##TABLE_ENDMost of the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was driven by one-time items, a higher proportion of our income from lower tax jurisdictions, and our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain prior years non-U.S. earnings positively impacted our effective income tax rate. A substantial majority of the increase in our effective tax rate between 2014 and 2013 was driven by the reenacted U.S. RD tax credit in 2013 containing two years' worth of RD tax credits. The U.S. RD tax credit was reenacted in Q4 2014 retroactive for the full year. It was also reenacted in Q1 2013 retroactive to the beginning of 2012.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) For 2015 compared to 2014 , the $1.4 billion  decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital, adjustments for non-cash items, and lower net income. The adjustments for non-cash items were lower due primarily to deferred taxes, partially offset by higher depreciation. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2015 compared to 2014 were $1.2 billion  lower due to lower income before taxes in 2015. Changes in assets and liabilities as of December 26, 2015 compared to December 27, 2014 included a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits. This decrease was due to higher profit-dependent compensation in 2014 that was paid out in 2015, and an increase in inventories due primarily to the ramp of our 6th generation Intel Core processor family of products, partially offset by the timing of certain tax benefits that reduced our income taxes payable position in 2015. Hewlett-Packard Company, our largest customer in 2014, separated into HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company on November 1, 2015. In 2015, these entities collectively accounted for 18% of our net revenue ( 18% in 2014 and 17% in 2013 ), Dell Inc. accounted for 15% of our net revenue ( 16% in 2014 and 15% in 2013 ), and Lenovo Group Limited accounted for 13% of our net revenue ( 12% in 2014 and 12% in 2013 ). Combined, these customers accounted for 46% of our net revenue ( 46% in 2014 and 44% in 2013 ) and 49% of our accounts receivable as of December 26, 2015 ( 43% as of December 27, 2014 ). For 2014 compared to 2013 , the $358 million  decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital, partially offset by higher net income and adjustment for non-cash items. Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions. Our capital expenditures were $7.3 billion in 2015 ( $10.1 billion in 2014 and $10.7 billion in 2013 ). The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to net trading assets activity (which was a source of cash in 2015 compared to a use of cash in 2014 ) and lower capital expenditures. This activity was partially offset by net available-for-sale activity (which was cash flow neutral in 2015 compared to a source of cash in 2014) and higher investments in non-marketable equity investments. The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to net available-for-sale activity (which was a source of cash in 2014 compared to a use of cash in 2013 ) and a decrease in cash used for net trading assets activity. This activity was partially offset by an increase in investments in non-marketable equity investments. Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans. Cash was provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to cash used by financing activities in 2014 , primarily due to the issuance of $9.5 billion of long-term debt and fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program, partially offset by lower proceeds from the sales of common stock through employee equity incentive plans and repayments of short-term debt compared to borrowings in 2014 . We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to  $65.0 billion in shares of our common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions. During 2015 , we repurchased $3.0 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, compared to $10.8 billion in 2014 . As of December 26, 2015 , $9.4 billion remained available for repurchasing common stock under the existing repurchase authorization limit. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of common stock through employee equity incentive plans totaled $866 million in 2015 compared to $1.7 billion in 2014 . Our total dividend payments were $4.6 billion in 2015 compared to $4.4 billion in 2014 . We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 93 quarters. In January 2016 , our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of common stock for Q1 2016 . The dividend is payable on March 1, 2016 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2016 . The increase in cash used for financing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program, partially offset by the issuance of short-term debt in 2014. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Liquidity Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. As of December 26, 2015 , cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets totaled $25.3 billion ( $14.1 billion as of December 27, 2014 ). The increased balance compared to December 27, 2014 was primarily related to the accumulation of cash consideration required for our acquisition of Altera, which closed on December 28, 2015, subsequent to our fiscal 2015 year-end. In addition to the $25.3 billion , we have $1.9 billion of other long-term investments, $1.2 billion of loans receivable and other, and $1.0 billion of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in A/A2 or better rated issuances, and a substantial majority of the issuances are rated AA-/Aa3 or better . Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $5.0 billion , which increased in 2015 from $3.0 billion . Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program were $900 million during 2015 , and no commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 26, 2015 . Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard  Poors and P-1 by Moodys as of December 26, 2015 . On December 21, 2015, we entered into a short-term credit facility to borrow up to $5.0 billion to facilitate the settlement of our acquisition of Altera. No borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility as of December 26, 2015 and it was closed in January 2016. In 2015, we issued $9.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. These notes were issued primarily to fund a portion of the cash consideration for our pending acquisition of Altera and for general corporate purposes, which may include the refinancing of existing indebtedness. For further information on the terms of the notes, see \" Note 15: Borrowings \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. As of December 26, 2015 , $11.1 billion of our $25.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Of the $11.1 billion held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, approximately $2.6 billion was available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of December 26, 2015 . The remaining amount of non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no U.S. current or deferred taxes have been accrued. This amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the U.S. and future acquisitions of non-U.S. entities. We believe our U.S. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the U.S., and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., such amounts would be subject to U.S. income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes. During 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Altera in an all-cash transaction. The transaction closed on December 28, 2015, subsequent to our fiscal 2015 year-end. As of the date we entered into the agreement, the transaction had an approximate value of $16.7 billion . We financed a portion of the acquisition by issuing $9.5 billion in long-term debt during 2015 and borrowing $4.0 billion against our short-term credit facility in the first quarter of 2016. We funded the remainder of the acquisition with issuances of commercial paper and existing cash and investments. For information on our indebtedness, see \" Note 15: Borrowings \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We believe that we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments. Fair Value of Financial Instruments When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligors credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. For further information, see \"Fair Value\" in \" Note 2: Accounting Policies \" and \" Note 4: Fair Value \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Marketable Debt Instruments As of December 26, 2015 , our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $23.4 billion of marketable debt instruments. Of these instruments, $13.2 billion was classified as Level 1, $10.0 billion as Level 2, and $118 million as Level 3. Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 were classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical instruments that are traded in active markets. We evaluate instrument-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt instrument is active. Of the $10.0 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2, approximately 50% was classified as Level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model performed by us, and approximately 50% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data. Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Loans Receivable and Reverse Repurchase Agreements As of December 26, 2015 , our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $479 million of loans receivable and $2.4 billion of reverse repurchase agreements. All of these investments were classified as Level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Marketable Equity Securities As of December 26, 2015 , our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $6.0 billion of marketable equity securities. Substantially all of these securities were classified as Level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations Significant contractual obligations as of December 26, 2015 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Payments Due by Period (In Millions)  Total  Less Than 1 Year  13 Years  35 Years  More Than 5 Years Operating lease obligations  $ 1,200  $  $  $  $ Capital purchase obligations 1  5,746  4,250  1,496     Other purchase obligations and commitments 2  3,966  1,784  1,986    Long-term debt obligations 3  38,120  2,299  4,499  3,383  27,939 Other long-term liabilities 4, 5  1,263     Total 6  $ 50,295  $ 9,355  $ 8,571  $ 3,948  $ 28,421 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 26, 2015 , as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2  Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include agreements to fund various projects with other companies.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Debt obligations are classified based on their stated maturity date, regardless of their classification on the consolidated balance sheet s. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $114 million of long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the preceding table. However, long-term income taxes payable, recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non-U.S. income taxes. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 5  Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Expected required contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $68 million to be made during 2016 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2016 are not practicable to estimate. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 6  Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities, except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. ##TABLE_END The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services included in \"Other purchase obligations and commitments\" in the preceding table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements have been excluded from the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table. These obligations include milestone-based co-marketing agreements, contingent funding or payment obligations, and milestone-based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the counterparty. As of December 26, 2015 , assuming that all future milestones are met, excluding the ASML milestones mentioned below, the additional required payments would be approximately $827 million . During 2012, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML intended to accelerate the development of EUV lithography, certain of which were amended in 2014. Under the amended agreements, Intel agreed to provide RD funding totaling  829 million  over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from ASML. Our remaining obligation, contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, is approximately 367 million , or $403 million , as of December 26, 2015 . As our obligation is contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, we have excluded this obligation from the preceding table. For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest. During 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. (Tsinghua Unigroup), an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co. Ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop Intel architecture- and communications-based solutions for phones. Subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, we have also agreed to invest up to 9.0 billion Chinese yuan (approximately $1.5 billion as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately 20% of UniSpreadtrum. During 2015, we invested $966 million to complete the first phase of the equity investment. The second phase of the investment will require additional funding of approximately $500 million ; however, as our obligation is contingent upon regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, it has been excluded from the preceding table. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements As of December 26, 2015 , we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END We are affected by changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 26, 2015 , and December 27, 2014 . Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange Rates In general, we economically hedge currency risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding gains and losses on the related hedging instruments. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, the Chinese yuan, the Japanese yen, and the Israeli shekel . We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in the fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs. These programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements . For further information, see \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $75 million as of December 26, 2015 (less than $50 million as of December 27, 2014 ). Interest Rates We generally hedge interest rate risks of fixed-rate debt investments with interest rate swaps, and we may elect to hedge interest rate risks of our indebtedness. Gains and losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments. We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and debt issuances. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR. A hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 1.0% , after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $15 million as of December 26, 2015 (an increase of approximately $10 million as of December 27, 2014 ). After taking into account interest rate and currency swaps, a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately $1.6 billion as of December 26, 2015 (an increase of approximately $1.0 billion as of December 27, 2014 ). The increase from December 27, 2014 was primarily driven by the inclusion of $9.5 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in Q3 and Q4 2015. The fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in the fair value of our net investment position. For further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, see \" Note 4: Fair Value \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Equity Prices Our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities at the inception of our investments. Before we enter into hedge arrangements, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors, as well as the expected timing of disposal, to determine whether hedging is appropriate. Our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives. We also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains and losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses and gains on the related liabilities . As of December 26, 2015 , the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $6.0 billion ( $7.1 billion as of December 27, 2014 ). Substantially all of our marketable equity investments portfolio as of December 26, 2015 was concentrated in our investment in ASML of $5.7 billion ( $6.9 billion as of December 27, 2014 ). Our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed necessary. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a decline of 30% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $1.8 billion , based on the value as of December 26, 2015 (a decrease in value of approximately $2.1 billion , based on the value as of December 27, 2014 using an assumed decline of 30% ). Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable cost method equity investments had a carrying amount of $2.9 billion as of December 26, 2015 ( $1.8 billion as of December 27, 2014 ) and included our investment in UniSpreadtrum (which was made in 2015) and Cloudera of $966 million and $454 million , respectively ( $454 million for Cloudera as of December 27, 2014 ). The carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $1.6 billion as of December 26, 2015 ( $1.4 billion as of December 27, 2014 ). A majority of our non-marketable equity method investments balance as of December 26, 2015 was concentrated in our IMFT and Cloudera investments of $872 million and $256 million , respectively ( $713 million and $280 million for IMFT and Cloudera, respectively, as of December 27, 2014 ). Commodity Price Risk Although we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in the fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place for our key commodities that mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration. For further information on commodity price risk, see \" Note 6: Derivative Financial Instruments \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Part IV, Item 15. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Intel Corporation at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2015 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Intel Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( 2013 framework ) and our report dated February 12, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP San Jose, California February 12, 2016  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intel Corporation We have audited Intel Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( 2013 framework ) (the COSO criteria). Intel Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Intel Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2015 consolidated financial statements of Intel Corporation and our report dated February 12, 2016 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP San Jose, California February 12, 2016 INTEL CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME ##TABLE_START Years Ended (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013 Net revenue  $ 55,355  $ 55,870  $ 52,708 Cost of sales  20,676  20,261  21,187 Gross margin  34,679  35,609  31,521 Research and development  12,128  11,537  10,611 Marketing, general and administrative  7,930  8,136  8,088 Restructuring and asset impairment charges    Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles    Operating expenses  20,677  20,262  19,230 Operating income  14,002  15,347  12,291 Gains (losses) on equity investments, net    Interest and other, net  (105 )   (151 ) Income before taxes  14,212  15,801  12,611 Provision for taxes  2,792  4,097  2,991 Net income  $ 11,420  $ 11,704  $ 9,620 Basic earnings per share of common stock  $ 2.41  $ 2.39  $ 1.94 Diluted earnings per share of common stock  $ 2.33  $ 2.31  $ 1.89 Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding:       Basic  4,742  4,901  4,970 Diluted  4,894  5,056  5,097 ##TABLE_ENDSee accompanying notes.

INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1: Basis of Presentation  We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 were 52-week years. Fiscal year 2016 is a 53-week fiscal year, and the first quarter of 2016 will be a 14-week quarter. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Intel Corporation (Intel) and our subsidiaries. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We use the equity method to account for equity investments in instances in which we own common stock or similar interests and have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation. As a result of our integration of McAfee Inc. (McAfee) in the third quarter of 2015, the functional currency for operations previously acquired from McAfee was changed to the U.S. dollar, making the U.S. dollar the functional currency for Intel and our subsidiaries. Note 2: Accounting Policies  Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The accounting estimates that require our most significant, difficult, and subjective judgments include: ##TABLE_START  the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the determination of useful lives for our property, plant and equipment and the related timing of when depreciation should begin; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the valuation and allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the valuation and recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment; goodwill; and identified intangibles); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the valuation of inventory; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies. ##TABLE_END The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. Fair Value Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value, except for cost method investments, cost method loans receivable, equity method investments, grants receivable, and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months. Substantially all of our liabilities are not measured and recorded at fair value. Fair Value Hierarchy The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data. For further discussion of fair value, see \" Note 4: Fair Value \" and \" Note 16: Retirement Benefit Plans .\" Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of approximately three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can include investments such as corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and reverse repurchase agreements classified as cash equivalents. See \" Note 4: Fair Value \" for the instruments held as cash equivalents. Trading Assets Marketable debt instruments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument, or when the marketable debt instrument itself is used to economically hedge foreign exchange rate risk from remeasurement. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. The gains or losses of these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net. We also designate certain floating-rate securitized financial instruments, primarily asset-backed securities, as trading assets. Available-for-Sale Investments We consider all liquid available-for-sale debt instruments with original maturities from the date of purchase of approximately three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Available-for-sale debt instruments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Available-for-sale debt instruments with remaining maturities beyond one year are classified as other long-term investments. Investments that we designate as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except as noted in the \"Other-Than-Temporary Impairment\" section that follows. We determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level. Our available-for-sale investments include: ##TABLE_START  Marketable debt instruments when the interest rate and foreign currency risks are not hedged at the inception of the investment or when our criteria for designation as trading assets are not met. We generally hold these debt instruments to generate a return commensurate with the U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR. We record the interest income and realized gains and losses on the sale of these instruments in interest and other, net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketable equity securities when there is no plan to sell or hedge the investment at the time of original classification. We acquire these equity investments to promote business and strategic objectives. To the extent that these investments continue to have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks through hedging activities. We record the realized gains or losses on the sale or exchange of marketable equity securities in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END Non-Marketable and Other Equity Investments Our non-marketable equity and other equity investments are included in other long-term assets. We account for non-marketable equity and other equity investments for which we do not have control over the investee as: ##TABLE_START  Equity method investments when we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Equity method investments include marketable and non-marketable investments. Our proportionate share of the income or loss is recognized on a one-quarter lag and is recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-marketable cost method investments when the equity method does not apply. ##TABLE_END We record the realized gains or losses on the sale of equity method and non-marketable cost method investments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Our available-for-sale investments and non-marketable and other equity investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. Investments are considered impaired when the fair value is below the investments adjusted cost basis. Impairments affect earnings as follows: ##TABLE_START  Marketable debt instruments when the fair value is below amortized cost and we intend to sell the instrument, or when it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument (that is, a credit loss exists). When we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument, we separate other-than-temporary impairments into amounts representing credit losses, which are recognized in interest and other, net, and amounts related to all other factors, which are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketable equity securities based on the specific facts and circumstances present at the time of assessment, which include the consideration of general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is below cost, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of value in the foreseeable future. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and the business outlook for, the investee, which may include industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and changes in the investees credit rating. We record other-than-temporary impairments on marketable equity securities and marketable equity method investments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-marketable equity investments based on our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment, and qualitative and quantitative analysis, including: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the investees revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the technological feasibility of the investees products and technologies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the management and governance structure of the investee; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  factors related to the investees ability to remain in business, such as the investees liquidity and debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. ##TABLE_END We record other-than-temporary impairments for non-marketable cost method investments and equity method investments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Derivative Financial Instruments Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk, commodity price risk, and credit risk.  When possible, we enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. Generally, our master netting agreements allow for net settlement in case of certain triggering events such as bankruptcy or default of one of the counterparties to the transaction. We may also elect to exchange cash collateral with certain of our counterparties on a regular basis. For presentation on our consolidated balance sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. Our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for hedge accounting designation. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A designated hedge with exposure to variability in the functional currency equivalent of the future foreign currency cash flows of a forecasted transaction or variability in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of a recognized asset or liability are examples of cash flow hedges. The criteria for designating a derivative as a cash flow hedge include the assessment of the instruments effectiveness in risk reduction, matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction, and the assessment of the probability that the underlying transaction will occur. For derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction. Derivatives that we designate as cash flow hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from operating activities. A designated hedge with exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability that are attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate is one example of a fair value hedge. For derivatives with fair value hedge accounting designation, the gains and losses of the hedge as well as the offsetting gains and losses attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate on the underlying hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current period. Derivatives that we designated as fair value hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from financing activities. We recognize gains and losses from changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes in the line item on the consolidated statements of income most closely associated with the related exposures, primarily in interest and other, net and gains (losses) on equity investments, net. As part of our strategic investment program, we also acquire equity derivative instruments, such as equity conversion rights associated with debt instruments, which we do not designate as hedging instruments. We recognize the gains or losses from changes in fair value of these equity derivative instruments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Realized gains and losses from derivatives not designated as hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within cash flows from operating activities or investing activities, depending on the activity the exposure is most closely associated with. Measurement of Effectiveness ##TABLE_START  Effectiveness for forwards is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the fair value of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item. For currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to capital purchases, forward points are excluded, and effectiveness is measured using spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item. For currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to operating expenditures, forward points are included, and effectiveness is measured using forward rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Effectiveness for options is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of an option instrument representing the hedged risks in the hedged item. Time value is excluded and effectiveness is measured using spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Effectiveness for interest rate swaps and commodity swaps is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the swap with the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item. ##TABLE_END If a cash flow hedge is discontinued because it is probable that the original hedged transaction will not occur as previously anticipated, the cumulative unrealized gain or loss on the related derivative is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. Subsequent gains or losses on the related derivative instrument are recognized in interest and other, net in each period until the instrument matures, is terminated, is re-designated as a qualified cash flow hedge, or is sold. Ineffective portions of cash flow hedges, as well as amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, are recognized in earnings in interest and other, net. For further discussion of our derivative instruments and risk management programs, see \" Note 6: Derivative Financial Instruments .\" INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Securities Lending We may enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions, generally to facilitate hedging and certain investment and financing transactions. Selected securities may be loaned, secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investment assets on our consolidated balance sheets. For lending agreements collateralized by cash and cash equivalents, collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. For lending agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the collateral as an asset or a liability, unless the collateral is repledged. Loans Receivable We make loans to third parties that are classified within other current assets or other long-term assets. We may elect the fair value option for loans when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. We record the gains or losses on these loans arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate, currency, and counterparty credit changes, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments, in interest and other, net. Loans that are denominated in U.S. dollars and have a floating-rate coupon are carried at amortized cost. We measure interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method, which is based on the effective yield of the loans rather than the stated coupon rate. For further discussion of our loans receivable, see \" Note 4: Fair Value .\" Inventories We compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory beginning in the quarter in which a product meets the technical criteria to qualify for sale to customers. Prior to qualification for sale, costs that do not meet the criteria for research and development (RD) are included in cost of sales in the period incurred. Inventories at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014 Raw materials  $  $ Work in process  2,893  2,375 Finished goods  1,742  1,436 Total inventories  $ 5,167  $ 4,273 ##TABLE_ENDProperty, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, net at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014 Land and buildings  $ 25,578  $ 22,989 Machinery and equipment  48,459  44,441 Construction in progress  9,359  12,279 Total property, plant and equipment, gross  83,396  79,709 Less: accumulated depreciation  (51,538 )  (46,471 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net  $ 31,858  $ 33,238 ##TABLE_ENDWe compute depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method. As of December 26, 2015 , substantially all of our depreciable property, plant and equipment assets were depreciated over the following estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment, 2 to 4 years; and buildings, 10 to 25 years. Beginning in 2016, our machinery and equipment will be depreciated over 2 to 5 years. We capitalize a portion of interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Included within construction in progress we have certain facilities on hold and not in use. These facilities are being held in a safe state, and we have plans to place them into service at a future date. Depreciation is not recognized on these assets and they are not eligible for capitalized interest when construction is on hold. The balance of such assets was approximately $ 3.4 billion as of December 26, 2015 (approximately $ 2.2 billion as of December 27, 2014 ). Goodwill We record goodwill when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. We assign the goodwill to our reporting units based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist , which includes evaluating qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment of a reporting units goodwill. We perform impairment tests using a fair value approach when necessary. The reporting units carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. For further discussion of goodwill, see \" Note 10: Goodwill .\" Identified Intangible Assets Licensed technology and patents are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods of benefit. We amortize all acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life based on economic benefit. Acquisition-related in-process RD assets represent the fair value of incomplete RD projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition; initially, these are classified as \"other intangible assets\" that are not subject to amortization. Assets related to projects that have been completed are transferred from \"other intangible assets\" to \"acquisition-related developed technology;\" these are subject to amortization, while assets related to projects that have been abandoned are impaired and expensed to RD. In the quarter following the period in which identified intangible assets become fully amortized, we remove the fully amortized balances from the gross asset and accumulated amortization amounts. The estimated useful life ranges for all identified intangible assets that are subject to amortization as of December 26, 2015 were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Years)  Estimated Useful Life Acquisition-related developed technology   Acquisition-related customer relationships   Acquisition-related brands   Licensed technology and patents   ##TABLE_ENDWe perform a quarterly review of significant finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess recoverability by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets, which is calculated based on projected discounted net cash flows. If an assets useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new, shorter useful life. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinite-lived intangible assets, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If necessary, a quantitative impairment test is performed to compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying value. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. For further discussion of identified intangible assets, see \" Note 11: Identified Intangible Assets .\" INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Product Warranty The vast majority of our products are sold with a limited warranty on product quality and a limited indemnification for customers against intellectual property rights infringement claims related to our products. The accrual and the related expense for known product warranty issues were not significant during the periods presented. Due to product testing, the short time typically between product shipment and the detection and correction of product failures, and the historical rate of payments on indemnification claims, the accrual and related expense for estimated incurred but unidentified issues were not significant during the periods presented. Revenue Recognition We recognize net product revenue when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, delivery has occurred, and acceptance, if applicable, as well as fixed pricing and probable collectability. We record pricing allowances, including discounts based on contractual arrangements with customers, when we recognize revenue as a reduction to both accounts receivable and net revenue. Because of frequent sales price reductions and rapid technology obsolescence in our industry, we defer product revenue and related costs of sales from component sales made to distributors under agreements allowing price protection or right of return until the distributors sell the merchandise. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. We include shipping charges billed to customers in net revenue, and include the related shipping costs in cost of sales. Revenue from license agreements on our McAfee products generally includes service and support agreements for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period. Revenue derived from online subscription products is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period. Professional services revenue is recognized as services are performed or, if required, upon customer acceptance. For arrangements with multiple elements, including software licenses, maintenance, and/or services, revenue is allocated across the separately identified deliverables and may be recognized or deferred. When vendor-specific objective evidence does not exist for undelivered elements such as maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Direct costs, such as costs related to revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements associated with license arrangements, as well as component costs associated with product revenue and sales commissions, are deferred and amortized over the same period that the related revenue is recognized. We record deferred revenue offset by the related cost of sales on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred income. Advertising Cooperative advertising programs reimburse customers for marketing activities for certain of our products, subject to defined criteria. We accrue cooperative advertising obligations and record the costs at the same time that the related revenue is recognized. We record cooperative advertising costs as marketing, general and administrative (MGA) expenses to the extent that an advertising benefit separate from the revenue transaction can be identified and the fair value of that advertising benefit received is determinable. We record any excess in cash paid to customers over the fair value of the advertising benefit we receive as a reduction in revenue. Advertising costs, including direct marketing costs, recorded within MGA expenses were $1.8 billion in 2015 ( $1.8 billion in 2014 and $1.9 billion in 2013 ). Employee Equity Incentive Plans We have employee equity incentive plans, which are described more fully in \" Note 18: Employee Equity Incentive Plans .\" We use the straight-line attribution method to recognize share-based compensation over the service period of the award. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock units (RSUs), we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and RSUs with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Income Taxes We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that it is believed more likely than not to be realized. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if that tax position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We then measure the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of income. For more information about income taxes, see \" Note 23: Income Taxes .\" Note 3: Recent Accounting Standards  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard to achieve a consistent application of revenue recognition within the U.S., resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by reporting companies under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Under the new model, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. On July 9, 2015, the FASB agreed to delay the effective date by one year; accordingly, the new standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018 and we expect to adopt it at that time. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet selected a transition method, nor have we determined the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. In 2015, the FASB issued an amended standard requiring that we classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and non-current. The amended standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2017; early adoption is permitted and we are evaluating whether we will early adopt. The amended standard may be adopted on either a prospective or retrospective basis. We do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. In 2015, the FASB issued an amended standard requiring that we recognize the effect on earnings of any adjustments identified during the measurement period after an acquisition in the same period the adjustment is identified, as opposed to the prior standard which required material adjustments be retrospectively adjusted. The amended standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2016. We do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2016, the FASB issued changes to the accounting for financial instruments that primarily affect equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. This standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018; certain provisions allow for early adoption and we are evaluating whether we will elect to early adopt these provisions. The new standard should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, with certain exceptions. We have not yet determined the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. In 2015, we adopted an amended standard simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt liability rather than showing the debt issuance costs as an asset. We have applied the amendment retrospectively to the comparable period presented and it did not have a significant impact on our financial statements. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 4: Fair Value Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 26, 2015  December 27, 2014   Fair Value Measured and Recorded at Reporting Date Using  Total  Fair Value Measured and Recorded at Reporting Date Using  Total (In Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Assets                 Cash equivalents:                 Corporate debt  $   $ 1,829  $   $ 1,829  $   $  $   $ Financial institution instruments  8,238  1,277    9,515   1,119    1,440 Government debt               Reverse repurchase agreements    2,368    2,368       Short-term investments:                 Corporate debt     1,120     Financial institution instruments      1,072   1,050    1,199 Government debt           Trading assets:                 Asset-backed securities           Corporate debt  1,744     2,308  2,625     2,964 Financial institution instruments      1,631  1,146     1,759 Government debt  1,107  1,908    3,015  1,295  2,221    3,516 Other current assets:                 Derivative assets          Loans receivable             Marketable equity securities  5,891     5,960  7,097      7,097 Other long-term investments:                 Asset-backed securities            Corporate debt      1,208     1,194 Financial institution instruments           Government debt           Other long-term assets:                 Derivative assets           Loans receivable             Total assets measured and recorded at fair value  19,145  13,388   32,662  13,965  9,613   23,708 Liabilities                 Other accrued liabilities:                 Derivative liabilities            Other long-term liabilities:                 Derivative liabilities             Total liabilities measured and recorded at fair value  $  $  $   $  $   $  $   $ ##TABLE_ENDGovernment debt includes instruments such as non-U.S. government bonds and U.S. agency securities.  Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed and floating rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the year ended December 26, 2015 , we transferred corporate debt and financial institution instruments of approximately $628 million from Level 1 to Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and approximately $403 million of financial institution instruments, corporate debt, and government debt from Level 2 to Level 1 ( $177 million of corporate debt, financial institution instruments, and government debt from Level 1 to Level 2 and $395 million from Level 2 to Level 1 during 2014 ). These transfers were based on changes in market activity for the underlying instruments. Our policy is to reflect transfers between the fair value hierarchy levels at the beginning of the quarter in which a change in circumstances resulted in the transfer. Investments in Debt Instruments Debt instruments reflected in the preceding table include investments such as asset-backed securities, corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and reverse repurchase agreements classified as cash equivalents . We classify our debt instruments as Level 2 when we use observable market prices for identical instruments that are traded in less active markets. When observable market prices for identical instruments are not available, we price the debt instruments using our own models, such as a discounted cash flow model, or non-binding market consensus prices based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers. These valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding and binding broker quotes; observable market prices for identical or similar instruments; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and unobservable market inputs that we consider to be not significant. When we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs, such as LIBOR-based yield curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings. All significant inputs are derived from or corroborated with observable market data. The fair values of debt instruments classified as Level 3 are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.  Fair Value Option for Loans Receivable We elected the fair value option for loans receivable when the interest rate or currency exchange rate risk was hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. As of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 , the fair value of our loans receivable for which we elected the fair value option did not significantly differ from the contractual principal balance based on the contractual currency. Loans receivable are classified within other current assets and other long-term assets. Fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Gains and losses from changes in fair value on the loans receivable and related derivative instruments, as well as interest income, are recorded in interest and other, net. During all periods presented, changes in the fair value of our loans receivable were largely offset by gains or losses on the related derivative instruments, resulting in an insignificant net impact on our consolidated statements of income. Gains and losses attributable to changes in credit risk are determined using observable credit default spreads for the issuer or comparable companies; these gains and losses were insignificant during all periods presented. We did not elect the fair value option for loans receivable when the interest rate or currency exchange rate risk was not hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument. Loans receivable not measured and recorded at fair value are included in the following \"Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\" section. Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis Our non-marketable equity investments, marketable equity method investments, and non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized. Some of our non-marketable equity investments have been measured and recorded at fair value due to events or circumstances that significantly impacted the fair value of those investments, resulting in other-than-temporary impairments. We classified these investments as Level 3 because the valuations used unobservable inputs that were significant to the fair value measurements and required management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices. Impairments recognized on non-marketable equity investments held as of December 26, 2015 were $160 million in 2015 ( $128 million in 2014 on non-marketable equity investments held as of December 27, 2014 and $106 million in 2013 on non-marketable equity investments held as of December 28, 2013 ). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis On a quarterly basis, we measure the fair value of our grants receivable, cost method loans receivable, non-marketable cost method investments, reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months, and indebtedness carried at amortized cost plus applicable hedge adjustments; however, the assets are recorded at fair value only when an impairment is recognized. The carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 26, 2015   Carrying Amount  Fair Value Measured Using  Fair Value (In Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Grants receivable  $  $   $  $   $ Loans receivable  $  $   $  $   $ Non-marketable cost method investments  $ 2,933  $   $   $ 3,904  $ 3,904 Reverse repurchase agreements  $ 1,000  $   $ 1,000  $   $ 1,000 Short-term debt  $ 2,593  $ 1,513  $ 1,563  $   $ 3,076 Long-term debt  $ 20,036  $ 14,058  $ 6,835  $   $ 20,893 NVIDIA Corporation cross-license agreement liability  $  $   $  $   $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 27, 2014   Carrying Amount  Fair Value Measured Using  Fair Value (In Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Grants receivable  $  $   $  $   $ Loans receivable  $  $   $  $   $ Non-marketable cost method investments  $ 1,769  $   $   $ 2,599  $ 2,599 Reverse repurchase agreements  $  $   $  $   $ Short-term debt  $ 1,580  $   $ 2,145  $   $ 2,145 Long-term debt  $ 12,059  $ 11,467  $ 1,309  $   $ 12,776 NVIDIA Corporation cross-license agreement liability  $  $   $  $   $ ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of our grants receivable is determined using a discounted cash flow model, which discounts future cash flows using an appropriate yield curve. As of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 , the carrying amount of our grants receivable was classified within other current assets and other long-term assets, as applicable. The carrying amount and fair value of loans receivable exclude loans measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of our loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreements, including those held at fair value, is determined using a discounted cash flow model. All significant inputs in the models are derived from or corroborated with observable market data, such as LIBOR-based yield curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings. The credit quality of these assets remains high, with credit ratings of A+/A1 for most of our loans receivable and a substantial majority of our reverse repurchase agreements as of December 26, 2015 . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) As of December 26, 2015 , and December 27, 2014 , the unrealized loss position of our non-marketable cost method investments was insignificant . Our non-marketable cost method investments are valued using a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment. Qualitative analysis of our investments involves understanding our investees revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects; the technological feasibility of our investees products and technologies; the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; and the management and governance structure of the investee. Quantitative assessments of the fair value of our investments are developed using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as revenue, earnings, comparable performance multiples, recent financing rounds, the terms of the investees issued interests, and the level of marketability of the investments. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies sizes, growth rates, industries, and development stages. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates regarding investees revenue, costs, and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available market, historical, and forecast data. We measure the fair value of our non-marketable cost method investments as close to the end of the period as feasible. The carrying amount and fair value of short-term debt exclude drafts payable. Our short-term debt recognized at amortized cost includes our 2009 junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2039 (2009 debentures) and our 2011 senior notes due 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2015 , the 2009 debentures were classified as short-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet and convertible at the option of the holder during the first quarter of 2016. For further information, see \" Note 15: Borrowings .\" Our long-term debt recognized at amortized cost is composed of our senior notes and our convertible debentures. The fair value of our senior notes is classified as Level 1 when we use quoted prices in active markets and Level 2 when the quoted prices are from less active markets or when other observable inputs are used to determine fair value. The fair value of our 2009 and 2005 convertible debentures is determined using discounted cash flow models with observable market inputs, and takes into consideration variables such as interest rate changes, comparable instruments, subordination discount, and credit-rating changes; it is, therefore, classified as Level 2. The NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA) cross-license agreement liability in the preceding table was incurred as a result of entering into a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA in January 2011, pursuant to which we agreed to make payments to NVIDIA over six years. The carrying amount of the liability arising from the agreement was classified within other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, based on the expected timing of the underlying payments ( $200 million due in each of January 2015 and 2016 treated as cash used for financing activities). The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model, which discounts future cash flows using our incremental borrowing rates.

Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed and floating rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits.  Substantially all time deposits were issued by institutions outside the U.S. as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 . For information on the unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into the consolidated statements of income, see \" Note 24: Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) .\" During 2015 , we sold available-for-sale investments for proceeds of $2.2 billion , of which $144 million related to sales of cash and cash equivalents ( $1.7 billion in 2014 , of which $509 million related to sales of cash and cash equivalents; and $1.3 billion in 2013 , of which $339 million related to sales of cash and cash equivalents). The gross realized gains on sales of available-for-sale investments were $133 million in 2015 ( $136 million in 2014 and $146 million in 2013 ). We determine the cost of an investment sold on an average cost basis at the individual security level. Impairments recognized on available-for-sale investments were insignificant for all periods presented. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale debt investments, by contractual maturity, as of December 26, 2015 were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  Cost  Fair Value Due in 1 year or less  $ 5,896  $ 5,893 Due in 12 years  1,271  1,268 Due in 25 years   Instruments not due at a single maturity date  8,267  8,266 Total  $ 16,057  $ 16,047 ##TABLE_ENDEquity Method Investments Equity method investments, classified within other long-term assets, at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 26, 2015  December 27, 2014 (Dollars In Millions)  Carrying Value  Ownership Percentage  Carrying Value  Ownership Percentage IM Flash Technologies, LLC  $  %  $  % Cloudera, Inc.   %   % Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC   %   % Other equity method investments       Total  $ 1,590    $ 1,446   ##TABLE_ENDIM Flash Technologies, LLC Since the inception of IM Flash Technologies, LLC (IMFT) in 2006, Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron) and Intel have jointly developed NAND flash memory and, most recently, 3D XPoint technology products. Intel also purchases jointly developed products directly from Micron under certain supply agreements. The IMFT operating agreement, most recently amended in January 2016, continues through 2024 unless earlier terminated under certain terms and conditions, and provides for certain buy-sell rights of the joint venture. Intel has the right to cause Micron to buy our interest in IMFT. If we exercise this right, Micron would set the closing date of the transaction within two years following such election and could elect to receive financing from us for one to two years. Subsequent to our put right, and commencing in January 2019, Micron has the right to call our interest in IMFT with the closing date to be effective within one year. IMFT is a variable interest entity, and all costs of IMFT are passed on to Micron and Intel through sale of products or services in proportional share of ownership. Intel's portion of IMFT costs, primarily related to product purchases and production-related services, was approximately $400 million in 2015 (approximately $400 million in 2014 and approximately $380 million in 2013 ). The amount due to IMFT for product purchases and services provided was approximately $20 million as of December 26, 2015 (approximately $60 million as of December 27, 2014 ). IMFT returned $6 million to Intel in 2014, which is reflected within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows ( $45 million in 2013). IMFT depends on Micron and Intel for any additional cash needs. Our known maximum exposure to loss approximated the carrying value of our investment balance in IMFT, which was $872 million as of December 26, 2015 . Except for the amount due to IMFT for product purchases and production-related services, we did not have any additional liabilities recognized on our consolidated balance sheets in connection with our interests in this joint venture as of December 26, 2015 . Our potential future losses could be higher than the carrying amount of our investment, as Intel and Micron are liable for other future operating costs or obligations of IMFT. Future cash calls could also increase our investment balance and the related exposure to loss. In addition, because we are currently committed to purchasing 49% of IMFTs production output and production-related services, we may be required to purchase products at a cost in excess of realizable value. We have determined that we do not have the characteristics of a consolidating investor in the variable interest entity and, therefore, we account for our interest in IMFT using the equity method of accounting. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Cloudera, Inc. During 2014, we invested in Cloudera, Inc. (Cloudera). Our fully diluted ownership interest in Cloudera is 17% as of December 26, 2015 . Our investment is accounted for under the equity and cost methods of accounting based on the rights associated with different instruments we own, and is classified within other long-term assets. The carrying value of our equity method investment was $256 million and of our cost method investment was $454 million as of December 26, 2015 ( $280 million for our equity method investment and $454 million for our cost method investment as of December 27, 2014 ). Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC During 2011, Intel and General Electric Company (GE) formed Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC (Care Innovations), an equally owned joint venture in the healthcare industry that focuses on independent living and delivery of health-related services by means of telecommunications. The company was formed by combining assets of GE Healthcares Home Health division and Intels Digital Health Group. Care Innovations is a variable interest entity and depends on Intel and GE for any additional cash needs. Our known maximum exposure to loss approximated the carrying value of our investment balance in Care Innovations, which was $64 million as of December 26, 2015 . Intel and GE equally share the power to direct all of Care Innovations' activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. We have determined that we do not have the characteristics of a consolidating investor in the variable interest entity and, therefore, we account for our interest in Care Innovations using the equity method of accounting. Clearwire Communications, LLC During 2013, we sold our interest in Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC), which we originally acquired in 2008, for proceeds of $328 million . These proceeds are included in other investing within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. We recognized a gain on the sale of our interest in Clearwire LLC of $328 million . For proceeds received and gains recognized for each investment, see \" Note 20: Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments, Net .\" Non-marketable cost method investments The carrying value of our non-marketable cost method investments was $2.9 billion as of December 26, 2015 ( $1.8 billion as of December 27, 2014 ), of which $454 million and $966 million related to our cost method investments in Cloudera and Beijing UniSpreadtrum Technology Ltd. (UniSpreadtrum), respectively. In 2015 , we recognized impairments of $164 million on non-marketable cost method investments, which is included within gains (losses) on equity investments, net on the consolidated statements of income ( $130 million in 2014 and $103 million in 2013 ). Investment in Beijing UniSpreadtrum Technology Ltd. During 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. (Tsinghua Unigroup), an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co. Ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop Intel architecture- and communications-based solutions for phones . We agreed to invest up to 9.0 billion Chinese yuan (approximately $1.5 billion as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately 20% of UniSpreadtrum, a holding company under Tsinghua Unigroup. During 2015, we invested  $966 million to complete the first phase of the equity investment. We have determined we will not have significant influence over the company and, therefore, we account for our interest using the cost method of accounting. Subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, the second phase of the investment will require additional funding of approximately $500 million . Trading Assets As of December 26, 2015 , and December 27, 2014 , substantially all of our trading assets were marketable debt instruments. Net losses related to trading assets still held at the reporting date were $152 million in 2015 (net losses of $530 million in 2014 and net losses of $70 million in 2013 ). Net gains on the related derivatives were $137 million in 2015 (net gains of $525 million in 2014 and $86 million in 2013 ). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 6: Derivative Financial Instruments  Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk, commodity price risk, and credit risk.  Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to currency exchange rate risk, and generally hedge our exposures with currency forward contracts, currency interest rate swaps, or currency options. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases is incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, the Chinese yuan, the Japanese yen, and the Israeli shekel . We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in the fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. Our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable are generally hedged with offsetting currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. We may also hedge currency risk arising from funding foreign currency-denominated forecasted investments. These programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements . Our currency risk management programs include: ##TABLE_START  Currency derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize currency forward contracts and currency options to hedge exposures to the variability in the U.S.-dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S.-dollar-denominated cash flows. These instruments generally mature within  12 months . For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and we reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction. We utilize currency interest rate swaps to hedge exposures to the variability in the U.S.-dollar equivalent of coupon and principal payments associated with our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated indebtedness. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Currency derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities, non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets, and hedges of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated loans receivable recognized at fair value. A substantial majority of these instruments mature within  12 months . Changes in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of the underlying assets and liabilities are approximately offset by the changes in the fair value of the related derivatives. We record net gains or losses in the line item on the consolidated statements of income most closely associated with the related exposures, primarily in interest and other, net, except for equity-related gains or losses, which we primarily record in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END Interest Rate Risk Our primary objective for holding investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields. We generally swap the returns on our investments in fixed-rate debt instruments with remaining maturities longer than six months into U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns, unless management specifically approves otherwise. We may elect to swap fixed coupon payments on our debt issuances for floating rate coupon payments. These swaps are settled at various interest payment times involving cash payments at each interest and principal payment date, with the majority of the contracts having quarterly payments. Our interest rate risk management programs include: ##TABLE_START  Interest rate derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest characteristics of debt instruments. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and we reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interest rate derivatives with fair value hedge accounting designation that utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge against changes in fair value on certain fixed rate debt due to fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate. For these derivatives, we recognize gains and losses in interest and other, net, along with the offsetting gains and losses attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate on the underlying hedged items. ##TABLE_END 81 INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) ##TABLE_START  Interest rate derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize interest rate swaps and currency interest rate swaps in economic hedging transactions, including hedges of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets and hedges of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated loans receivable recognized at fair value. Floating interest rates on the swaps generally reset on a quarterly basis. Changes in the fair value of the debt instruments classified as trading assets and loans receivable recognized at fair value are generally offset by changes in the fair value of the related derivatives, both of which are recorded in interest and other, net. ##TABLE_END Equity Market Risk Our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities at the inception of our investments. Before we enter into hedge arrangements, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors, as well as the expected timing of disposal, to determine whether hedging is appropriate. Our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives. We recognize changes in the fair value of such derivatives in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. We also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains and losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses and gains on the related liabilities , both of which are recorded in cost of sales and operating expenses. Deferred compensation liabilities were $1.3 billion as of December 26, 2015 ( $1.2 billion as of December 27, 2014 ), and are included in other accrued liabilities. Commodity Price Risk We operate facilities that consume commodities and have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in the fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices, such as those for natural gas. These programs reduce, but do not always eliminate, the impact of commodity price movements. Our commodity price risk management program may include commodity derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize commodity swap contracts to hedge future cash flow exposures to the variability in commodity prices. These instruments generally mature within 12 months. For these derivatives, we report the after-tax gain (loss) from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction.

The hedges were designated as cash flow hedges and the related gains and losses attributable to changes in the spot rates were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Hedge gains and losses attributable to changes in the forward rates were recognized in interest and other, net. During 2015, we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting treatment for $478 million of forward contracts since we could no longer assert that funding is probable to occur within the initially specified timeline. Hedge losses accumulated in other comprehensive income and subsequently released to interest and other, net, related to these de-designated forward contracts were insignificant. During 2015, we entered into $4.4 billion of interest rate swap agreements to hedge against changes in the fair value attributable to the benchmark interest rates related to $4.4 billion of our outstanding senior notes. These hedges were designated as fair value hedges. During 2015, we entered into $577 million of currency interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the variability in the U.S.-dollar equivalent of coupon and principal payments associated with our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated indebtedness.

When possible, we enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. For presentation on our consolidated balance sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterpartys relative credit standing. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in A/A2 or better rated issuances, and a substantial majority of the issuances are rated AA-/Aa3 or better . Our investment policy requires substantially all investments with original maturities at the time of investment of up to six months to be rated at least A-2/P-2 by Standard  Poors/Moodys, and specifies a higher minimum rating for investments with longer maturities. For instance, investments with maturities of greater than three years generally require a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3 at the time of investment. Government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, or the absence of A-rated counterparties in certain countries, result in some minor exceptions. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterpartys obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of December 26, 2015 , our total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding money market funds invested in U.S. treasury and U.S. agency securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities, did not exceed $500 million . To further reduce credit risk, we obtain and secure available collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions, when we deem it appropriate. A substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers . We also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries . Hewlett-Packard Company, our largest customer in 2014, separated into HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company on November 1, 2015. These entities, together with Dell Inc. and Lenovo Group Limited, represent our largest customers. Collectively, these customers accounted for 46% of net revenue for 2015 ( 46% for 2014 and 44% for 2013 ) and 49% of net accounts receivable as of December 26, 2015 ( 43% as of December 27, 2014 ). We believe that the net accounts receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk, based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe that credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.  INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 8: Acquisitions  During 2015, we completed eight acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate consideration (net of cash acquired) of $1.0 billion , a substantial majority of which was cash consideration. Substantially all of the consideration was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets, such as acquisition-related developed technology and acquisition-related customer relationships. Included in these acquisitions is our acquisition of Lantiq Semiconductor (Lantiq), intended to extend Intel's success in cable home gateways into DSL and fiber markets. We acquired Lantiq in the second quarter of 2015 for net cash consideration of $345 million , substantially all of which was allocated to goodwill and intangible assets, such as acquisition-related developed technology and acquisition-related customer relationships. The operating results of Lantiq are included in our Client Computing Group operating segment. During 2014, we completed eight acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate consideration of $963 million , substantially all cash consideration. A substantial majority of the consideration was allocated to goodwill and acquisition-related developed technology intangible assets. Included in these acquisitions is our acquisition of the Axxia Networking Business (Axxia business) of Avago Technologies Limited, intended to accelerate growth in the mobile wireless base station business. We acquired the Axxia business in the fourth quarter of 2014 for net cash consideration of $650 million , substantially all of which was allocated to goodwill and acquisition-related developed technology intangible assets. The operating results of the Axxia business are included in our Data Center Group (DCG) operating segment. During 2013, we completed 12 acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate net cash consideration of $925 million . Most of the consideration was allocated to goodwill and acquisition-related developed technology intangible assets. Included in these acquisitions is our acquisition of Stonesoft Oyj (Stonesoft), intended to expand our network security solutions, specifically addressing next-generation firewall products. We acquired Stonesoft in the third quarter of 2013 for net cash consideration of $381 million , substantially all of which was allocated to goodwill and acquisition-related developed technology intangible assets. Stonesoft's operating results are included in our software and services operating segments. Acquisitions completed in 2015, 2014, and 2013, both individually and in the aggregate, were not significant to our results of operations. For information on the assignment of goodwill to our operating segments, see \" Note 10: Goodwill \" and for information on the classification of intangible assets, see \" Note 11: Identified Intangible Assets .\" Acquisition of Altera Corporation During the second quarter of 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Altera Corporation (Altera) in an all-cash transaction. The transaction closed on December 28, 2015, subsequent to our fiscal 2015 year-end. Altera is a global semiconductor company that designs and sells programmable semiconductors and related products, including programmable logic devices, which incorporate field-programmable gate array (FPGAs) and complex programmable logic devices, and highly integrated System-on-Chip (SoC) devices. This acquisition is expected to expand our reach within the compute continuum, as the combination of our leading-edge products and manufacturing process with Altera's leading FPGA technology is expected to enable new classes of platforms that meet customer needs in the data center and Internet of Things market segments. Upon completion of the acquisition, each outstanding share of Altera common stock and, subject to certain exceptions, each share of Altera common stock underlying vested stock option awards, restricted stock unit awards and performance-based restricted stock unit awards were converted into the right to receive $ 54.00 per share in cash, without interest. During the third and fourth quarters of 2015, we issued $ 9.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured debt, and in the first quarter of 2016 we borrowed $4.0 billion against our short-term credit facility, in order to fund a portion of the total purchase price (net of cash acquired) of $ 14.5 billion . For more information on our indebtedness, see \" Note 15: Borrowings .\" Since the closing of this acquisition occurred subsequent to our fiscal year-end, the allocation of the purchase price to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to a formal valuation process, which has not yet been completed. We will reflect the preliminary valuation of the net assets acquired and the operational results of Altera beginning December 28, 2015, the close date of the transaction, in our first quarter of 2016. The purchase price allocation will be finalized as soon as practicable within the measurement period, but not later than one year following the acquisition close date. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Although the purchase price allocation for this acquisition and pro forma financial information is not yet available, we expect a substantial majority of the purchase price will be allocated to goodwill and acquisition-related developed technology and other identified intangible assets. Additionally, we assumed $ 1.5 billion of aggregate principal amount of Altera's outstanding indentures. Altera became a new Intel operating segment called the Programmable Solutions Group upon acquisition. Note 9: Divestitures  In 2015, we completed three separate divestiture transactions. As a result of these transactions, we received aggregate net cash consideration of $153 million , included within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows, and recognized a gain within interest and other, net on the consolidated statements of income. During the first quarter of 2014, we completed the divestiture of the assets of Intel Media, a business division dedicated to the development of cloud TV products and services, to Verizon Communications Inc. As a result of the transaction, we received aggregate net cash consideration of $ 150 million , included within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows, and recognized a gain within interest and other, net on the consolidated statements of income.

For further discussion on our currency interest rate swaps, see \" Note 6: Derivative Financial Instruments .\" ##TABLE_END Senior Notes During 2015, we issued a total of $9.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes to fund a portion of the cash consideration for our acquisition of Altera. The acquisition of Altera closed on December 28, 2015, subsequent to our fiscal 2015 year-end. For more information on the closing of our Altera acquisition, see \" Note 8: Acquisitions .\" All of our senior notes pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually.

For more information on our interest rate swaps, see \" Note 6: Derivative Financial Instruments .\" We may redeem the notes prior to their maturity at our option at specified redemption prices and subject to certain restrictions. The notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and will effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Convertible Debentures In 2009 and 2005, we issued junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2039 (2009 debentures) and 2035 (2005 debentures), respectively. Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually. ##TABLE_START   Debentures  Debentures Annual stated coupon interest rate  3.25 %  2.95 % Annual effective interest rate  7.20 %  6.45 % ##TABLE_ENDThe effective interest rate is based on the rate, at inception, for a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature. 2009 Debentures. The 2009 debentures have a contingent interest component that requires us to pay interest based on certain thresholds or for certain events, commencing on August 1, 2019. After such date, if the 10 -day average trading price of $1,000 principal amount of the bond immediately preceding any six -month interest period is less than or equal to $650 or greater than or equal to $1,500 , we are required to pay contingent 0.25% or 0.50% annual interest, respectively. The fair value of the related contingent interest embedded derivative was $13 million as of December 26, 2015 ( $8 million as of December 27, 2014 ). The 2009 debentures are convertible, subject to certain conditions. Holders can surrender the 2009 debentures for conversion if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter. We will settle any conversion of the 2009 debentures in cash up to the face value, and any amount in excess of face value will be settled in cash or stock at our option. On or after August 5, 2019, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2009 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period. In addition, if certain events occur in the future, the indentures governing the 2009 debentures provide that each holder of the debentures can, for a pre-defined period of time, require us to repurchase the holders debentures for the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The 2009 debentures are subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior debt and to the other liabilities of our subsidiaries. We have concluded that the 2009 debentures are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded stock conversion options qualify as derivatives. In addition, we have concluded that the embedded conversion options would be classified in stockholders equity if they were freestanding derivative instruments. As such, the embedded conversion options are not accounted for separately as derivative liabilities. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2005 Debentures. The 2005 debentures have a contingent interest component that requires us to pay interest based on certain thresholds or for certain events. If the 10 -day average trading price of $1,000 principal amount of the bond immediately preceding any six -month interest period is less than or equal to $800 or greater than or equal to $1,300 , we are required to pay contingent 0.25% or 0.40% annual interest, respectively. As of December 26, 2015 , we did not meet either contingent interest threshold. The fair value of the related contingent interest embedded derivative was $4 million as of December 26, 2015 ( $4 million as of December 27, 2014 ). The 2005 debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock. Holders can surrender the 2005 debentures for conversion at any time. We can settle any conversion of the 2005 debentures in cash or stock at our option. The 2005 debentures will become redeemable if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period. Once this condition has been met, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2005 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if certain events occur in the future, the indentures governing the 2005 debentures provide that each holder of the debentures can, for a pre-defined period of time, require us to repurchase the holders debentures for the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The 2005 debentures are subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior debt and to the other liabilities of our subsidiaries. We have concluded that the 2005 debentures are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded stock conversion options qualify as derivatives. In addition, we have concluded that the embedded conversion options would be classified in stockholders equity if they were freestanding derivative instruments. As such, the embedded conversion options are not accounted for separately as derivative liabilities. ##TABLE_START   2009 Debentures  2005 Debentures (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014 Outstanding principal  $ 2,000  $ 2,000  $ 1,600  $ 1,600 Equity component (including temporary equity) carrying amount  $  $  $  $ Unamortized discount  $  $  $  $ Net debt carrying amount  $ 1,103  $ 1,088  $  $ Conversion rate (shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures)  46.58  46.06  35.82  34.95 Effective conversion price (per share of common stock)  $ 21.47  $ 21.71  $ 27.92  $ 28.61 ##TABLE_ENDIn the preceding table, the remaining amortization periods for the unamortized discounts for the 2009 and 2005 debentures are approximately 24 and 20 years, respectively, as of December 26, 2015 . The conversion rate adjusts for certain events outlined in the indentures governing the 2009 and 2005 debentures, such as quarterly dividend distributions in excess of $0.14 and $0.10 per share for the 2009 and 2005 debentures, respectively, but it does not adjust for accrued interest. In addition, the conversion rate will increase for a holder of either the 2009 or 2005 debentures who elects to convert the debentures in connection with certain share exchanges, mergers, or consolidations involving Intel. During the fourth quarter of 2015 , the closing stock price conversion right condition of the 2009 debentures continued to be met and the debentures will be convertible at the option of the holders during the first quarter of 2016 . As a result, the $1.1 billion carrying amount of the 2009 debentures was classified as short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 26, 2015 ( $1.1 billion as of December 27, 2014 ). The excess of the amount of cash payable if converted over the carrying amount of the 2009 debentures of $897 million has been classified as temporary equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 26, 2015 ( $912 million as of December 27, 2014 ). In future periods, if the closing stock price conversion right condition is no longer met, all outstanding 2009 debentures would be reclassified to long-term debt and the temporary equity would be reclassified to stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Debt Maturities Our aggregate debt maturities based on outstanding principal as of December 26, 2015 , by year payable, were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)    $ 1,500  3,000    2020  1,750 2021 and thereafter  17,845 Total  $ 24,276 ##TABLE_ENDIn the preceding table, the 2009 debentures are classified based on their stated maturity date, regardless of their classification on the consolidated balance sheet . Note 16: Retirement Benefit Plans  Retirement Contribution Plans We provide tax-qualified retirement contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. and certain other countries. The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees hired prior to January 1, 2011 are eligible for and receive discretionary employer contributions in the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2011 receive discretionary employer contributions in the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan, which are participant-directed. Our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) determines the annual discretionary employer contribution amounts for the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan and the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan under delegation of authority from our Board of Directors, pursuant to the terms of the plans. Effective January 1, 2015, the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution plan assets and future discretionary employer contributions are participant-directed. For the benefit of eligible U.S. employees, we also provide a non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees. This plan is designed to permit certain discretionary employer contributions and to permit employees to defer a portion of compensation in addition to their Intel 401(k) Savings Plan deferrals. This plan is unfunded. We expensed $337 million for the qualified and non-qualified U.S. retirement contribution plans in 2015 ( $286 million in 2014 and $298 million in 2013 ). In the first quarter of 2016 , we funded $318 million for the 2015 contributions to the qualified U.S. retirement contribution plans. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans U.S. Pension Benefits. For employees hired prior to January 1, 2011, we provide a tax-qualified defined-benefit pension plan, the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan, for eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. Beginning on January 1, 2015, future benefit accruals in the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan were frozen to all employees at or above a specific grade level, and generally covering all highly compensated employees in the plan. Starting in 2016, the impacted employees will receive discretionary employer contributions in the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan, instead of the Retirement Contribution plan. This change was contingent on receiving a favorable private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which we received in October 2014. As a result, our projected benefit obligation was reduced by $1.1 billion in 2014, most of which was also included as a change in actuarial valuation on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan benefit is determined by a participants years of service and final average compensation, as defined by the plan document. The plan generates a minimum pension benefit if the participants U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan benefit exceeds the annuitized value of their U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan benefit. If participant balances in the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan do not grow sufficiently, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan could increase significantly. Consistent with applicable law, assets of the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan are held in trust, solely for the benefit of plan participants, and are not available for general corporate purposes. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Non-U.S. Pension Benefits. We also provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain other countries, most significantly Ireland, Israel, and Germany. Consistent with the requirements of local law, we deposit funds for certain plans with insurance companies, with third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts, and/or accrue for the unfunded portion of the obligation. The Ireland pension plan and one of our Germany pension plans were closed to employees hired on or after June 20, 2012 and January 1, 2014, respectively. U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits. Upon retirement, eligible U.S. employees who were hired prior to January 1, 2014 are credited with a defined dollar amount, based on years of service, into a U.S. Sheltered Employee Retirement Medical Account (SERMA). These credits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase coverage in the retirees choice of medical plan. If the available credits are not sufficient to pay the entire cost of the coverage, the remaining cost is the retirees responsibility. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2014 are not eligible to earn a SERMA benefit. Funding Policy. Our practice is to fund the various pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of applicable local laws and regulations. Additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate. Funding for the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan is discretionary under applicable laws and regulations, and is reviewed annually; additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate. Depending on the design of the plan, local customs, and market circumstances, the liabilities of a plan may exceed qualified plan assets. Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets The vested benefit obligation for a defined benefit pension plan is the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee is currently entitled based on the employee's expected date of separation or retirement. The changes in the projected benefit obligations and plan assets at the end of each period for the plans described above were as follows: ##TABLE_START   U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits (In Millions)  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014 Beginning projected benefit obligation  $  $ 1,137  $ 2,423  $ 1,695  $  $ Service cost       Interest cost       Actuarial (gain) loss    (250 )   (21 )  Currency exchange rate changes      (190 )  (254 )     Plan curtailments    (1,083 )         Other  (79 )  (59 )  (34 )   (16 )  (22 ) Ending projected benefit obligation  $  $  $ 2,140  $ 2,423  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits (In Millions)  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014 Beginning fair value of plan assets  $  $  $ 1,017  $ 1,005  $  $ Actual return on plan assets  (4 )      Employer contributions         Currency exchange rate changes      (66 )  (114 )     Other  (82 )  (56 )  (54 )  (27 )  (24 )  (1 ) Ending fair value of plan assets  $  $  $ 1,011  $ 1,017  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDINTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START   U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits (In Millions)  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014 Other long-term assets  $   $   $  $  $   $  Other long-term liabilities  (363 )  (269 )  (1,144 )  (1,420 )  (150 )  (119 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (income), before tax     1,217   Net amount recognized  $ (205 )  $ (268 )  $ (221 )  $ (189 )  $ (111 )  $ (86 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) before taxes at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START   U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits Years Ended (In Millions)  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014 Net prior service credit (cost)  $   $   $ (12 )  $ (13 )  $ (43 )  $ (48 ) Net actuarial gain (loss)  (158 )  (1 )  (896 )  (1,204 )   Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), before tax  $ (158 )  $ (1 )  $ (908 )  $ (1,217 )  $ (39 )  $ (33 ) ##TABLE_ENDWe use a corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the larger of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized on a straight-line basis. The period of amortization is the average remaining service of active participants who are expected to receive benefits under the plans. As of December 26, 2015 , the accumulated benefit obligation was $899 million for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan ( $808 million as of December 27, 2014 ) and $1.6 billion for the non-U.S. defined-benefit pension plans ( $1.7 billion as of December 27, 2014 ). Included in the aggregate data in the following tables are the amounts applicable to our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, as well as plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. Amounts related to such plans at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START   U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits (In Millions)  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014 Plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:         Accumulated benefit obligations  $  $  $ 1,239  $ 1,344 Plan assets  $  $  $  $ Plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:         Projected benefit obligations  $  $  $ 2,079  $ 2,361 Plan assets  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDOn a worldwide basis, our pension and postretirement benefit plans were 55% funded as of December 26, 2015 . The U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan, which accounts for 27% of the worldwide pension and postretirement benefit obligations, was 63% funded. Funded status is not indicative of our ability to pay ongoing pension benefits or of our obligation to fund retirement trusts. Required pension funding for U.S. retirement plans is determined in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which sets required minimum contributions. Cumulative company funding to the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan currently exceeds the minimum ERISA funding requirements. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Assumptions Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START   U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits    Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014 Discount rate  4.0 %  3.8 %  3.1 %  2.7 %  4.1 %  4.1 % Rate of compensation increase  3.7 %  3.8 %  3.8 %  4.0 %  n/a  n/a ##TABLE_ENDWeighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine costs for the plans for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START   U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits           Discount rate  3.8 %  4.6 %  3.9 %  2.8 %  4.0 %  4.2 %  3.9 %  4.6 %  4.2 % Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  6.1 %  5.4 %  4.5 %  5.7 %  5.7 %  5.2 %  7.4 %  7.4 %  7.7 % Rate of compensation increase  3.8 %  3.8 %  4.1 %  4.0 %  4.1 %  4.3 %  n/a  n/a  n/a ##TABLE_ENDFor the U.S. plans, we developed the discount rate by calculating the benefit payment streams by year to determine when benefit payments will be due. We then matched the benefit payment streams by year to the AA corporate bond rates to match the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments and discounted back to the measurement date to determine the appropriate discount rate. For the non-U.S. plans, we used two approaches to develop the discount rate. In certain countries, we used a model consisting of a theoretical bond portfolio for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximated the estimated benefit payments of our pension plans. In other countries, we analyzed current market long-term bond rates and matched the bond maturity with the average duration of the pension liabilities. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions takes into consideration both duration and risk of the investment portfolios, and is developed through consensus and building-block methodologies. The consensus methodology includes unadjusted estimates by the fund manager on future market expectations by broad asset classes and geography. The building-block approach determines the rates of return implied by historical risk premiums across asset classes. In addition, we analyze rates of return relevant to the country where each plan is in effect and the investments applicable to the plan, expectations of future returns, local actuarial projections, and the projected long-term rates of return from external investment managers. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets shown for the non-U.S. plan assets is weighted to reflect each countrys relative portion of the non-U.S. plan assets. Net Periodic Benefit Cost In 2015 , the net periodic benefit cost for U.S. pension benefits, non-U.S. pension benefits, and U.S. postretirement medical benefits was $26 million ( $36 million in 2014 and $230 million in 2013 ), $198 million ( $165 million in 2014 and $116 million in 2013 ) and $26 million ( $17 million in 2014 and $77 million in 2013 ), respectively. The decrease in the U.S. net periodic pension benefit cost in 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily attributed to the one-time curtailment gain related to the freeze of future benefit accruals and lower recognized net actuarial losses. U.S. Pension Plan Assets In general, the investment strategy for U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets is to maximize risk-adjusted returns, taking into consideration the investment horizon and expected volatility to help ensure that there are sufficient assets available to pay pension benefits as they come due. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which were 55% for equity investments and 45% for fixed-income investments in 2015 . For 2016 , the expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets is 5.6% . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following investment categories at the end of each period: ##TABLE_START   December 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014   Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using     (In Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total  Total Equity securities  $  $  $   $  $ Fixed income      Other investments        Total assets measured at fair value  $  $  $  $  $ Cash          Total U.S. pension plan assets at fair value        $  $ ##TABLE_ENDA substantial majority of the fixed income investments in the preceding table are asset-backed securities, corporate debt, and government debt. Government debt includes instruments such as non-U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, and U.S. treasury securities. Non-U.S. Plan Assets The investments of the non-U.S. plans are managed by insurance companies, pension funds, or third-party trustees, consistent with regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. The investment manager evaluates performance by comparing the actual rate of return to the return on similar assets. Investments managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under standard contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we have discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equity investments and fixed-income investments, either through index funds or direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market risk and to help ensure that the pension assets are available to pay benefits as they come due. The target allocation of the non-U.S. plan assets that we have control over is 50% equity investments and 50% fixed-income investments. For 2016 , the average expected long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plan assets is 5.3% . Non-U.S. plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following investment categories at the end of each period: ##TABLE_START   December 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014   Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using     (In Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total  Total Equity securities  $  $  $  $  $ Fixed income       Total assets measured at fair value  $  $  $  $  $ Cash         Total non-U.S. plan assets at fair value        $ 1,011  $ 1,017 ##TABLE_ENDSubstantially all of the equity investments in the preceding table are invested in a diversified mix of equities of developed countries, including the U.S., and emerging markets throughout the world. The majority of the fixed income investments in the preceding table are investments held by insurance companies and insurance contracts that are managed by qualified insurance companies. We do not have control over the target allocation or visibility of the investment strategies of those investments. Insurance contracts and investments held by insurance companies made up 33% of total non-U.S. plan assets as of December 26, 2015 ( 35% as of December 27, 2014 ). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) U.S. Postretirement Medical Plan Assets In general, the investment strategy for U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets, due to the level of expected future benefit payments. The assets are invested solely in a tax-aware global equity portfolio, which is actively managed by an external investment manager. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is composed of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries, including the U.S., and emerging markets throughout the world. For 2016 , the expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets is 7% . As of December 26, 2015 , substantially all of the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets were invested in exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. Concentrations of Risk We manage a variety of risks, including credit, liquidity, and market risks, across our plan assets through our investment managers. We define a concentration of risk as an undiversified exposure to one of the aforementioned risks that unnecessarily increases the exposure to a loss of plan assets. We monitor exposure to such risks in both the U.S. and non-U.S. plans by monitoring the magnitude of the risk in each plan and diversifying our exposure to such risks across a variety of counterparties, instruments, and markets. As of December 26, 2015 , we did not have concentrations of risk in any single entity, manager, counterparty, sector, industry, or country. Funding Expectations Under applicable law for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan, we are required to contribute a minimum of approximately $10 million during 2016 . Our expected required funding for the non-U.S. plans during 2016 is approximately $58 million . Estimated Future Benefit Payments Estimated benefit payments over the next 10 fiscal years are as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits  $  $  $ 2017  $  $  $ 2018  $  $  $ 2019  $  $  $ 2020  $  $  $ 2021-2025  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDINTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 17: Commitments  A portion of our capital equipment and certain facilities are under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2030 .

Minimum rental commitments under all non-cancelable leases with an initial term in excess of one year were as follows as of December 26, 2015 : ##TABLE_START (In Millions)    $ 2017  2018  2019  2020  2021 and thereafter  Total  $ 1,200 ##TABLE_ENDCommitments for construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment totaled $5.7 billion as of December 26, 2015 ( $3.5 billion as of December 27, 2014 ), a majority of which will be due within the next 12 months. Other purchase obligations and commitments totaled approximately $4.0 billion as of December 26, 2015 (approximately $2.5 billion as of December 27, 2014 ). Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include agreements to fund various projects with other companies. In addition, we have various contractual commitments with Micron and IMFT. For further information on these contractual commitments, see \" Note 5: Cash and Investments .\" During 2012, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) intended to accelerate the development of extreme ultraviolet lithography projects and deep ultraviolet immersion lithography projects, including generic developments applicable to both 300mm and 450mm. Certain of these agreements were amended in 2014. Under the amended agreements, Intel agreed to provide RD funding totaling  829 million  over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from ASML. Our remaining obligation, contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, is approximately 367 million , or $403 million , as of December 26, 2015 . As our obligation is contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, we have excluded this obligation from other purchase obligations and commitments. Note 18: Employee Equity Incentive Plans  Our equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. In May 2015, stockholders approved an extension of the expiration date of the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan) to June 2018 and approved an additional 34 million shares for issuance. Under the 2006 Plan, 753 million shares of common stock are available for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors through June 2018. As of December 26, 2015 , 258.4 million shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the 2006 Plan. Going forward, we may assume the equity incentive plans and the outstanding equity awards of certain acquired companies. Once they are assumed, we do not grant additional shares of common stock under those plans. The stock options and RSUs assumed generally retain their terms and conditions as they were originally granted. We grant restricted stock units with both a market condition and a service condition (market-based restricted stock units), referred to in our 2015 Proxy Statement as outperformance stock units (OSUs), to a group of senior officers, employees, and non-employee directors. For OSUs granted in 2015 , the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting will range from 0% to 200% of the target amount, based on total stockholder return (TSR) on our common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of a peer group over a three -year period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. As of December 26, 2015 , 4.7 million OSUs were outstanding. These OSUs accrue dividend equivalents and generally vest three years and one month from the grant date. RSU and option awards generally vest over four years from the grant date. Stock options generally expire seven years from the date of grant. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In May 2015, stockholders approved an extension of the expiration date of the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan to August 2021. The 2006 Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific dates. Under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan, 373 million shares of common stock are available for issuance through August 2021. As of December 26, 2015 , 181.3 million shares of common stock were available for issuance under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation recognized in 2015 was $1.3 billion ( $1.1 billion in 2014 and $1.1 billion in 2013 ). On a quarterly basis, we assess changes to our estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on our review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. We recognize the effect of adjustments made to the forfeiture rates, if any, in the period that we change the forfeiture estimate. The effect of forfeiture rate adjustments in all periods presented was not significant. The total share-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory as of December 26, 2015 was $49 million ( $39 million as of December 27, 2014 and $38 million as of December 28, 2013 ). During 2015 , the tax benefit that we realized for the tax deduction from share-based awards totaled $533 million ( $555 million in 2014 and $385 million in 2013 ). We estimate the fair value of RSUs with time-based vesting using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our shares of common stock prior to vesting. We estimate the fair value of OSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant. We based the weighted average estimated value of RSU grants, as well as the weighted average assumptions that we used in calculating the fair value, on estimates at the date of grant, for each period as follows: ##TABLE_START   Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013 Estimated values  $ 31.63  $ 25.40  $ 21.45 Risk-free interest rate  0.6 %  0.5 %  0.2 % Dividend yield  2.9 %  3.3 %  3.8 % Volatility  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted under the 2006 Plan and rights to acquire shares of common stock granted under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan. No options were granted in 2015 . We based the weighted average estimated value of employee stock option grants and rights granted under the stock purchase plan, as well as the weighted average assumptions used in calculating the fair value, on estimates at the date of grant, for each period as follows: ##TABLE_START   Stock Options  Stock Purchase Plan   Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013 Estimated values  n/a  $ 3.61  $ 3.11  $ 6.56  $ 5.87  $ 4.52 Expected life (in years)  n/a  5.1  5.2  0.5  0.5  0.5 Risk-free interest rate  n/a  1.7 %  0.8 %  0.1 %  0.1 %  0.1 % Dividend yield  n/a  3.6 %  3.9 %  3.1 %  3.2 %  4.0 % Volatility  n/a  %  %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDWe base the expected volatility on implied volatility because we have determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. We use historical option exercise data as the basis for determining expected life, as we believe that historical data provides a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected life input for valuing options using the Black-Scholes model.

Stock Purchase Plan Approximately 77% of our employees were participating in our 2006 Stock Purchase Plan as of December 26, 2015 ( 76% in 2014 and 76% in 2013 ). Employees purchased 15.8 million shares of common stock in 2015 for $421 million under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan ( 19.4 million shares of common stock for $393 million in 2014 and 20.5 million shares of common stock for $369 million in 2013 ). As of December 26, 2015 , unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire shares of common stock under our stock purchase plan totaled  $14 million . We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately two months . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 19: Common Stock Repurchases  Common Stock Repurchase Program We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to  $65.0 billion in shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. As of December 26, 2015 , $9.4 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit.  During 2015 , we repurchased 95.7 million shares of common stock at a cost of $3.0 billion ( 332.4 million shares of common stock at a cost of $10.8 billion in 2014 and 94.1 million shares of common stock at a cost of $2.1 billion in 2013 ). We have repurchased 4.8 billion shares of common stock at a cost of $104.9 billion since the program began in 1990. Restricted Stock Unit Withholdings We grant RSUs pursuant to the 2006 Plan. For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees.  In our consolidated financial statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase plan . During 2015 , we withheld 13.5 million shares of common stock to satisfy $442 million ( 12.0 million shares of common stock to satisfy $332 million in 2014 and 13.1 million shares of common stock to satisfy $293 million in 2013 ) of employees tax obligations. Note 20: Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments, Net  The components of gains (losses) on equity investments, net for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years Ended (In Millions)  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013 Share of equity method investee losses, net  $ (95 )  $ (69 )  $ (69 ) Impairments  (185 )  (146 )  (123 ) Gains on sales, net    Dividends    Other, net    Total gains (losses) on equity investments, net  $ $ $ ##TABLE_ENDThe substantial majority of other, net for 2015 resulted from gains on third-party merger transactions, and the majority of gains on sales, net for 2014 resulted from gains on private equity sales. During 2013, we sold our shares in Clearwire Corporation, which had been accounted for as available-for-sale marketable equity securities, and our interest in Clearwire LLC, which had been accounted for as an equity method investment. We received proceeds of $142 million on the sale of our shares in Clearwire Corporation and $328 million on the sale of our interest in Clearwire LLC. The proceeds received on the sale of our shares in Clearwire Corporation and our interest in Clearwire LLC are included in \"sales of available-for-sale investments\" and \"other investing,\" respectively, within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. During 2013, we recognized gains of $111 million on the sale of our shares in Clearwire Corporation and $328 million on the sale of our interest in Clearwire LLC. The total gain of $439 million on these transactions is included in \"gains (losses) on equity investments, net\" on the consolidated statements of income.

During 2015, we recognized an interest and other, net loss primarily due to higher interest expense, which includes the 2015 issuances of our $9.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. For further information on these transactions, see \" Note 15: Borrowings .\" This was partially offset by divestiture gains recognized in 2015. For further information on these transactions, see \" Note 9: Divestitures .\" During 2014, we completed the divestiture of our Intel Media assets. As a result of the transaction, we recognized a gain within \"other, net\" in the preceding table. For further information, see \" Note 9: Divestitures .\" Note 22: Earnings Per Share  We computed our basic and diluted earnings per share of common stock for each period as follows: ##TABLE_START Years Ended (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013 Net income available to common stockholders  $ 11,420  $ 11,704  $ 9,620 Weighted average shares of common stock outstandingbasic  4,742  4,901  4,970 Dilutive effect of employee equity incentive plans    Dilutive effect of convertible debt    Weighted average shares of common stock outstandingdiluted  4,894  5,056  5,097 Basic earnings per share of common stock  $ 2.41  $ 2.39  $ 1.94 Diluted earnings per share of common stock  $ 2.33  $ 2.31  $ 1.89 ##TABLE_ENDWe computed basic earnings per share of common stock using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. We computed diluted earnings per share of common stock using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Net income available to participating securities was insignificant for all periods presented. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock for our 2005 debentures are determined by applying the if-converted method. However, as our 2009 debentures require settlement of the principal amount of the debt in cash upon conversion, with the conversion premium paid in cash or stock at our option, potentially dilutive shares of common stock are determined by applying the treasury stock method. For further discussion on the specific conversion features of our 2005 and 2009 debentures, see \" Note 15: Borrowings .\" In 2015 , we excluded on average 2 million outstanding stock options and RSUs from the computation of diluted earnings per share of common stock because these shares of common stock would have been anti-dilutive ( 10 million in 2014 and 55 million in 2013 ). These options could potentially be included in the diluted earnings per share of common stock calculation in the future if the average market value of the shares of common stock increases and is greater than the exercise price of these options. In all years presented, we included our 2009 debentures in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of common stock because the average market price was above the conversion price. We could potentially exclude the 2009 debentures in the future if the average market price is below the conversion price.

A substantial majority of the increase in our effective tax rate between 2014 and 2013 was driven by the reenacted U.S. RD tax credit in 2013 containing two years' worth of RD tax credits. The U.S. RD tax credit was reenacted in the fourth quarter of 2014 retroactive for the full year. It was also reenacted in the first quarter of 2013 retroactive to the beginning of 2012. Income in certain non-U.S. countries is fully exempt from income taxes for a limited period of time due to eligible activities and certain capital investment actions. These full tax exemptions expire at various dates through 2023 ; however, the exemptions in certain countries are eligible for renewal. In 2015 , the tax benefit attributable to tax holidays was $85 million ( $166 million for 2014 and $213 million for 2013 ) with a $0.02 impact on diluted earnings per share ( $0.03 for 2014 and $0.04 for 2013 ). During 2015 , net income tax benefits attributable to equity-based compensation transactions that were allocated to stockholders equity totaled $172 million (net benefits of $103 million in 2014 and net benefits of $3 million in 2013 ). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Deferred and Current Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014 Deferred tax assets:     Accrued compensation and other benefits  $  $ Share-based compensation   Deferred income   Inventory   State credits and net operating losses   Other, net   Gross deferred tax assets  4,020  3,684 Valuation allowance  (701 )  (595 ) Total deferred tax assets  3,319  3,089 Deferred tax liabilities:     Property, plant and equipment  (505 )  (1,171 ) Licenses and intangibles  (563 )  (576 ) Convertible debt  (1,042 )  (977 ) Unrealized gains on investments and derivatives  (717 )  (1,017 ) Investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries  (37 )  (252 ) Other, net  (358 )  (291 ) Total deferred tax liabilities  (3,222 )  (4,284 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)   (1,195 )      Reported as:     Current deferred tax assets  2,036  1,958 Non-current deferred tax assets   Non-current deferred tax liabilities  (2,539 )  (3,775 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)  $  $ (1,195 ) ##TABLE_ENDNon-current deferred tax assets are included within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The valuation allowance is based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. The valuation allowance as of December 26, 2015 included allowances related to unrealized state credit carryforwards of $607 million and matters related to our non-U.S. subsidiaries of $94 million . As of December 26, 2015 , our federal, state, and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $171 million , $101 million , and $384 million , respectively. A majority of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The remaining non-U.S., as well as the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, expire at various dates through 2035 . A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. relates to acquisitions and, as a result, is limited in the amount that can be recognized in any one year. The non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards include $218 million that is not likely to be recovered and has been reduced by a valuation allowance. As of December 26, 2015 , we had not recognized U.S. deferred income taxes on a cumulative total of $26.9 billion of undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and $1.8 billion of other basis differences of our investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, primarily related to McAfee. Determining the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to investments in these non-U.S. subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested is not practicable. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest those earnings and other basis differences in operations outside the U.S. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Current income taxes receivable of $468 million as of December 26, 2015 ( $79 million as of December 27, 2014 ) is included in other current assets. Current income taxes payable of $272 million as of December 26, 2015 ( $443 million as of December 27, 2014 ) is included in other accrued liabilities. Long-term income taxes payable of $114 million as of December 26, 2015 ( $262 million as of December 27, 2014 ) is included in other long-term liabilities, which includes uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and non-U.S. tax credits, and may also include other long-term tax liabilities that are not uncertain but have not yet been paid. Uncertain Tax Positions The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years Ended (In Millions)  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 28, 2013 Beginning gross unrecognized tax benefits  $  $  $ Settlements and effective settlements with tax authorities and related remeasurements  (452 )  (220 )  (2 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods    Decreases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods  (34 )  (1 )  (9 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during current period    Ending gross unrecognized tax benefits  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe related tax benefit for settlements, effective settlements, and remeasurements is $419 million for 2015 ( insignificant in 2014 and 2013 ). If the remaining balance of $101 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 26, 2015 ( $577 million as of December 27, 2014 ) were recognized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $32 million ( $485 million as of December 27, 2014 ) and a reduction in the effective tax rate. During all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of income. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in 2015 ( $21 million in 2014 and insignificant in 2013 ). As of December 26, 2015 , we had $34 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits ( $44 million as of December 27, 2014 ). Our tax policy is to comply with the laws, regulations, and filing requirements of all jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain U.S. federal and non-U.S. tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could significantly increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. However, the estimated impact of income tax expense and net income is not expected to be significant. We file federal, state, and non-U.S. tax returns. For state and non-U.S. tax returns, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2002 . For federal tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2009 .

We estimate that we will reclassify approximately $185 million (before taxes) of net derivative losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings within the next 12 months. Note 25: Contingencies  Legal Proceedings We are a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted in this section. Although management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Government Competition Matters and Related Consumer Class Actions A number of proceedings generally have challenged and continue to challenge certain of our competitive practices. The allegations in these proceedings vary and are described in more detail in the following paragraphs. In general, they contend that we improperly conditioned price rebates and other discounts on our microprocessors on exclusive or near-exclusive dealing by some of our customers; and they allege that our software compiler business unfairly preferred Intel microprocessors over competing microprocessors and that, through the use of our compilers and other means, we have caused the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading benchmark results concerning our microprocessors. Based on the procedural posture of the various remaining competition matters, which we describe in the following paragraphs, our investment of resources to explain and defend our position has declined as compared to the period 2005-2011. Nonetheless, certain of the matters remain active, and these challenges could continue for a number of years, potentially requiring us to invest additional resources. We believe that we compete lawfully and that our marketing, business, intellectual property, and other challenged practices benefit our customers and our stockholders, and we will continue to conduct a vigorous defense in the remaining proceedings. In 2001, the European Commission (EC) commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy our microprocessors. We received numerous requests for information and documents from the EC and we responded to each of those requests. The EC issued a Statement of Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. In May 2009, the EC issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged \"conditional rebates and payments\" that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged \"payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.\" The EC imposed a fine in the amount of 1.1 billion ( $1.4 billion as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to \"immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in\" the EC decision. The EC decision contained no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision stated that we should \"cease and desist\" from further conduct that, in the EC's opinion, would violate applicable law. We took steps, which are subject to the EC's ongoing review, to comply with that decision pending appeal. We had discussions with the EC to better understand the decision and to explain changes to our business practices. We appealed the EC decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The hearing of our appeal took place in July 2012. In June 2014, the General Court rejected our appeal in its entirety. In August 2014, we filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. On November 11, 2014, Intervener Association for Competitive Technologies filed comments in support of Intels grounds of appeal. The EC and interveners filed briefs in November 2014, we filed a reply in February 2015, and the EC filed a rejoinder in April 2015. The Court of Justice is likely to hold oral argument and issue its decision in 2016. At least 82 separate class-action lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. District Courts for the Northern District of California, Southern District of California, District of Idaho, District of Nebraska, District of New Mexico, District of Maine, and District of Delaware, as well as in various California, Kansas, and Tennessee state courts. These actions generally repeat the allegations made in a now-settled lawsuit filed against us by AMD in June 2005 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (AMD litigation). Like the AMD litigation, these class-action lawsuits allege that we engaged in various actions in violation of the Sherman Act and other laws by, among other things: providing discounts and rebates to our manufacturer and distributor customers conditioned on exclusive or near-exclusive dealing that allegedly unfairly interfered with AMD's ability to sell its microprocessors; interfering with certain AMD product launches; and interfering with AMD's participation in certain industry standards-setting groups. The class actions allege various consumer injuries, including that consumers in various states have been injured by paying higher prices for computers containing our microprocessors. We dispute these class-action claims and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) All of the federal and state class actions other than the California class actions were transferred by the Multidistrict Litigation Panel to the U.S. District Court in Delaware for all pre-trial proceedings and discovery (MDL proceedings). The Delaware district court appointed a Special Master to address issues in the MDL proceedings, as assigned by the court. In January 2010, the plaintiffs in the Delaware action filed a motion for sanctions for our alleged failure to preserve evidence. This motion largely copies a motion previously filed by AMD in the AMD litigation, which has settled. The plaintiffs in the MDL proceedings also moved for certification of a class of members who purchased certain personal computers containing products sold by us. In July 2010, the Special Master issued a Report and Recommendation (Report) denying the motion to certify a class. The MDL plaintiffs filed objections to the Special Master's Report, and a hearing on those objections was held before the district court in July 2013. In July 2014, the district court affirmed the Special Master's ruling and issued an order denying the MDL plaintiffs' motion for class certification. In August 2014, plaintiffs filed a petition for interlocutory appeal of the district court's decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which the Third Circuit denied in October 2014. In December 2014, Intel filed a motion for summary judgment on the claims of the remaining individual plaintiffs. We subsequently negotiated a settlement of the claims and the case was dismissed in September 2015. All California class actions have been consolidated in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County. The plaintiffs in the California actions moved for class certification, which we are in the process of opposing. At our request, the court in the California actions agreed to delay ruling on this motion until after the Delaware district court ruled on the similar motion in the MDL proceedings. The plaintiffs asked the court for leave to retain a new expert and to amend their previous motion for class certification. The court granted plaintiffs request in February 2015 and the hearing on plaintiffs amended class certification motion took place in January 2016; we are awaiting the court's decision. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from these matters. In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation  Between May and July 2011, former employees of Intel, Adobe Systems Incorporated, Apple Inc., Google Inc., Intuit Inc., Lucasfilm Ltd., and Pixar filed antitrust class-action lawsuits in the California Superior Courts alleging that these companies had entered into a conspiracy to suppress the compensation of their employees. The lawsuits were removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and in September 2011 the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, captioned In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation . The plaintiffs allegations reference the 2009 and 2010 investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ) into employment practices in the technology industry, as well as the DOJs complaints and subsequent stipulated final judgments with the seven companies named as defendants in the lawsuits. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants entered into certain unlawful agreements not to cold call employees of particular other defendants and that there was an overarching conspiracy among the defendants. Plaintiffs assert one such agreement specific to Intel, namely that Intel and Google entered into an agreement starting in 2005, not to cold call each other's employees. Plaintiffs assert claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act and Section 4 of the Clayton Antitrust Act and seek a declaration that the defendants alleged actions violated the antitrust laws, damages trebled as provided for by law under the Sherman Act or Clayton Act, restitution and disgorgement, and attorneys fees and costs. In October 2013, the district court certified a class consisting of approximately 65,000 current or former employees of the seven defendants and set the matter for trial in late May 2014. The so-called \"technical class\" consists of a group of current and former technical, creative, and RD employees at each of the defendants. In January 2014, Intel filed a motion for summary judgment, which the court denied in March 2014. In April 2014, Intel, Adobe, Apple, and Google reached an agreement with plaintiffs to settle this lawsuit, but in August 2014, the district court denied preliminary approval of the settlement. In September 2014, defendants filed a petition for writ of mandamus asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to reverse the district courts decision. The Ninth Circuit ordered briefing and scheduled a March 2015 hearing date on the writ petition. Defendants have withdrawn the petition for writ of mandamus in light of the settlement agreement discussed below. In January 2015, Intel, Adobe, Apple, and Google reached a second agreement with plaintiffs to settle this lawsuit, which the court preliminarily approved in March 2015. The court held a final fairness hearing in July 2015, and in September 2015, gave its final approval of the settlement and entered final judgment in the lawsuit. We made our settlement payment in October 2015, which we accrued for in our operating expenses for 2014. Although we disputed the plaintiffs claims, we agreed to settle the lawsuit to avoid the uncertainties, expenses, and diversion of resources from continued litigation. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In re Intel Corporation Shareholder Derivative Litigation regarding High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation In March 2014, the Police Retirement System of St. Louis (PRSSL) filed a shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County against Intel, certain current and former members of our Board of Directors and a current officer. The complaint alleges that the defendants breached their duties to the company by participating in, or allowing, alleged antitrust violations, which were alleged in In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation . In March 2014, a second plaintiff, Barbara Templeton, filed a substantially similar derivative suit in the same court. In May 2014, a third shareholder, Robert Achermann, filed a substantially similar derivative action in the same court. The court consolidated the three actions into one, which is captioned In re Intel Corporation Shareholder Derivative Litigation . Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint in July 2014. In August 2015, the court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint. The plaintiffs thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration and a motion for new trial, both of which the court denied in October 2015. In November 2015, plaintiffs PRSSL and Templeton appealed the court's decision. In June 2015, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) filed a shareholder derivative action in the Chancery Court in Delaware against Intel, certain current and former members of our Board of Directors, and a current officer. The lawsuit makes allegations that are substantially similar to those in the California shareholder derivative litigation described above, but contain additional allegations regarding breach of the duty of disclosure surrounding the In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation and that the Intel 2013 and 2014 proxy statements were false and misleading in that they misrepresented the effectiveness of the Boards oversight of compliance issues at Intel and the Boards compliance with Intels Code of Conduct and Board of Director Guidelines on Significant Corporate Governance Issues. In October 2015, the court stayed the IBEW lawsuit for six months pending further developments in the California case. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. v. Intel In May 2013, Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. (LOTC) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LBHI) filed an adversary complaint in the United States Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York asserting claims against us arising from a 2008 contract between Intel and LOTC. Under the terms of the 2008 contract, we prepaid $1.0 billion to LOTC, in exchange for which LOTC was required to deliver to us on or before September 29, 2008, quantities of Intel common stock and cash determined by a formula set forth in the contract. LOTC's performance under the contract was secured by $1.0 billion of cash collateral. Under the terms of the contract, LOTC was obligated to deliver approximately 50 million shares of our common stock to us on September 29, 2008. LOTC failed to deliver any Intel common stock or cash, and we exercised our right of setoff against the $1.0 billion collateral. LOTC and LBHI acknowledge in their complaint that we were entitled to set off our losses against the collateral, but they assert that we withheld collateral in excess of our losses that should have been returned to LOTC. The complaint asserts a claim for breach of contract, a claim for turnover under section 542(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, and a claim for violation of the automatic stay under section 362(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code. The complaint does not expressly quantify the amount of damages claimed, but does assert multiple theories of damages that impliedly seek up to $312 million of alleged excess collateral, plus interest at LIBOR plus 13.5% , compounded daily. In June 2013, we filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs' bankruptcy claims and for a determination that the breach of contract claim is \"non-core\" under the Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy court granted our motion in its entirety in December 2013. In May 2014, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York denied our request that it withdraw its reference of plaintiffs' adversary complaint to the bankruptcy court. In January 2015, Intel and the plaintiffs filed competing motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs' motion requested judgment against Intel \"in the amount of no less than\" $129 million , plus interest. In September 2015, the bankruptcy court ruled in favor of Intel and issued proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law recommending that the district court deny plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and grant Intels motion for summary judgment. In October 2015, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) McAfee, Inc. Shareholder Litigation On August 19, 2010, we announced that we had agreed to acquire all of the common stock of McAfee, Inc. (McAfee) for $48.00 per share. Four McAfee shareholders filed putative class-action lawsuits in Santa Clara County, California Superior Court challenging the proposed transaction. The cases were ordered consolidated in September 2010. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that named former McAfee board members, McAfee, and Intel as defendants, and alleged that the McAfee board members breached their fiduciary duties and that McAfee and Intel aided and abetted those breaches of duty. The complaint requested rescission of the merger agreement, such other equitable relief as the court may deem proper, and an award of damages in an unspecified amount. In June 2012, the plaintiffs damages expert asserted that the value of a McAfee share for the purposes of assessing damages should be $62.08 . In January 2012, the court certified the action as a class action, appointed the Central Pension Laborers Fund to act as the class representative, and scheduled trial to begin in January 2013. In March 2012, defendants filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse the class certification order; the petition was denied in June 2012. In March 2012, at defendants request, the court held that plaintiffs were not entitled to a jury trial, and ordered a bench trial. In April 2012, plaintiffs filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse that order, which the court of appeal denied in July 2012. In August 2012, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted that motion in November 2012, and entered final judgment in the case in February 2013. In April 2013, plaintiffs appealed the final judgment. Intel, McAfee, and McAfees board of directors filed an opposition to plaintiffs appeal in December 2014. Because the resolution of the appeal may materially impact the scope and nature of the proceeding, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from this matter. We dispute the class-action claims and intend to continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously. Note 26: Operating Segments and Geographic Information  Our operating segments in effect as of December 26, 2015 included: ##TABLE_START  Client Computing Group   All other  Data Center Group   Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group  Internet of Things Group   New Devices Group  Software and services operating segments    Intel Security Group    Software and Services Group   ##TABLE_ENDDuring the first quarter of 2015, we combined the PC Client Group and Mobile and Communications Group to create the Client Computing Group (CCG).  This change in our organizational structure reflects our strategy to address all aspects of the client computing market segment and utilize our intellectual property to offer compelling customer solutions for a wide range of end-user devices. All prior-period amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance starting in fiscal year 2015, and include other minor reorganizations. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we renamed the McAfee operating segment as the Intel Security Group. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our CEO. The CODM allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about its revenue and operating income (loss). We manage our business activities primarily based on a product segmentation basis. CCG and the Data Center Group (DCG) are our reportable operating segments. The Internet of Things Group and the aggregated \"software and services operating segments,\" as shown in the preceding operating segment list, do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. Our Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG) and New Devices Group operating segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments and their combined results are included within the \"all other\" category. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Revenue for our reportable and aggregated non-reportable operating segments is primarily related to the following product lines: ##TABLE_START  Client Computing Group . Includes platforms designed for notebooks (including Ultrabook devices), 2 in 1 systems, desktops (including all-in-ones and high-end enthusiast PCs), tablets, phones, wireless and wired connectivity products, and mobile communication components.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Data Center Group. Includes platforms designed for the enterprise, cloud, communications infrastructure, and technical computing segments.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Internet of Things Group. Includes platforms designed for Internet of Things market segments, including retail, transportation, industrial, and buildings and home use, along with a broad range of other market segments.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Software and services operating segments. Includes software products designed to deliver innovative solutions that secure computers, mobile devices, and networks, and software products and services that promote Intel architecture as the platform of choice for software development.  ##TABLE_END We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments, and the expenses are included in the following operating results. The \"all other\" category includes revenue and expenses such as: ##TABLE_START  results of operations from our NSG and New Devices Group;  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  amounts included within restructuring and asset impairment charges;  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a portion of employee benefits, compensation, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments;  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  divested businesses for which discrete operating results are not regularly reviewed by our CODM;  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives, including our foundry business; and  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.  ##TABLE_END The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. As our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segments operating income (loss) results. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Except for these differences, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on managements evaluation (with the participation of our CEO and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 26, 2015 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015 , the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( 2013 framework ). Managements assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst  Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting, as stated in the firms attestation report, which is included within Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

The increased cost of constructing new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers has led to a reduced number of companies that can build and equip leading-edge manufacturing facilities. Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries and subcontractors for manufacturing and assembly and test needs. We provide foundry services as an alternative to such foundries. ##TABLE_ENDManufacturing and Assembly and Test In 2016, the majority of our wafer manufacturing was conducted within the U.S. Manufacturing conducted within and outside the U.S. may be impacted by the timing of a facilitys transition to a newer process technology, as well as a facilitys capacity utilization. We manufacture our products in facilities at the following locations: As of December 31, 2016 , our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers, with a substantial majority manufactured using our 14nm and 22nm process technologies. We continue to develop new generations of manufacturing process technology and realize the benefits which enable silicon designs with less space per transistor, reduced heat output from each transistor, and increased number of integrated features on each chip. These advancements make possible innovations of new products with higher functionality while controlling power, cost, and size. We incur factory start-up costs as we ramp our facilities for a new process technology. In 2017, we announced plans to complete our Arizona facility which is targeted for 7nm process technology. We use third-party foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components, including communications, connectivity, networking, FPGA, and memory products. In addition, we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture board-level products and systems. We purchase certain communications and connectivity products from external vendors primarily in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition to the assembly and test facilities presented on the map, we use subcontractors to augment capacity to perform assembly and test of certain products, primarily chipsets and communications, FPGAs, connectivity, and memory products. We utilize a multi-source strategy for our memory business to enable a robust and flexible supply chain. In 2016, we began ramping our facility in Dalian, China to produce leading-edge non-volatile memory. This expansion enables us to maintain a cost-effective strategy to best serve our customers in 3D NAND. In addition to our strategic investments to manufacture memory internally, we have a supplemental supply agreement with Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron), as well as capacity from the joint venture, IM Flash Technologies, LLC (IMFT) factory in Lehi, Utah. For further information on IMFT, see \" Note 9: Investments \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our employment and operating practices are consistent with, and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by, local country law. Intel expects all suppliers to comply with the Intel Code of Conduct and the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct, both of which set standards that address the rights of workers to safe and healthy working conditions, environmental responsibility, compliance with privacy and data security obligations, and compliance with applicable laws.

We set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments and audits. We regularly communicate those expectations and work with our suppliers to implement improvements when necessary. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all materials and resources. However, we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country. In those cases, we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply. We have entered into long-term contracts with certain suppliers to help ensure a stable supply of silicon and semiconductor manufacturing tools. Our products are typically manufactured at multiple Intel facilities around the world or by subcontractors. However, some products are manufactured in only one Intel or subcontractor facility, and we seek to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility. Employees As of December 31, 2016 , we had 106,000 employees worldwide, with approximately 50% of those employees located in the U.S. Research and Development We are committed to investing in world-class technology development, particularly in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits. RD expenditures were $12.7 billion in 2016 ( $12.1 billion in 2015 and $11.5 billion in 2014 ). Our RD activities are directed toward the delivery of solutions consisting of hardware and software platforms and supporting services across a wide range of computing devices. We are focused on developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products, which will in turn enable new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers. We focus our RD efforts on advanced computing technologies, developing new microarchitectures, advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology, delivering the next generation of platforms, improving our platform initiatives, developing new solutions in emerging technologies (including memory and the Internet of Things), and developing software solutions and tools. Our RD efforts are intended to enable new levels of performance and address areas such as energy efficiency, system-level integration, security, scalability for multi-core architectures, system manageability, and ease of use. As part of our RD efforts, we plan to introduce new microarchitectures for our various products on a regular cadence. We expect to lengthen the amount of time we will utilize our 14nm and our next-generation 10nm process technologies with multiple waves of product offerings, further optimizing our technologies while meeting the yearly market cadence for product introductions. Advances in our silicon technology have enabled us to continue making Moores Law a reality. In 2014, we began manufacturing our 5th generation Intel Core processor family using our 14 nm process technology. In 2015, we released a new microarchitecture (our 6th generation Intel Core processor family), using our 14nm process technology. We enhanced the 14nm process on our 7th generation Intel Core processor family in 2016 and plan to further optimize our technologies with the upcoming 8th generation Intel Core processor family in 2017. We continue to make progress on developing our next-generation 10nm manufacturing process technology. We have continued expanding on the advances anticipated by Moores Law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products optimized for a wider variety of applications. We expect that these advances will result in a significant reduction in transistor leakage, lower active power, and an increase in transistor density. These advances in our process technologies will enable new classes of products, from smart and connected things and devices to high performance systems that power data centers. For instance, we offer the Intel  Atom processor-based Intel  Joule compute module, a high-performance system-on-module designed to enable developers and entrepreneurs to go from concept to prototype to production in less time and at lower cost than with traditional system development. With our continued focus on silicon and manufacturing technology leadership, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) in 2012, certain of which were amended in 2014 to further define the commercial terms between the parties. These amended agreements, in which Intel agreed to provide RD funding over five years, are intended to accelerate the development of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography projects and deep ultraviolet immersion lithography projects, including generic developments applicable to both 300mm and 450mm. Our RD activities include initiatives that further enhance our platform solutions, for example: ##TABLE_START  The development of multi-mode LTE* and 5G technology, which brings connectivity capability to smart and connected devices and will power the 5G network infrastructure; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Memory technology innovation with 3D XPoint and 3D NAND technologies, which enables higher density and high performance storage and system memory solutions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Integration of FPGA technology, which enables new classes of products for the data center and Internet of Things market segments; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other initiatives, such as leading-edge foundry platforms, ecosystem partner development, graphics, and high-performance computing. ##TABLE_END Our RD model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies, leading standards initiatives, and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies, including joint pathfinding conducted between researchers at Intel Labs and our business groups. We centrally manage key cross-business group product initiatives to align and prioritize our RD activities across these groups. In addition, we may augment our RD activities by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar RD focus areas, as well as directly purchasing or licensing technology applicable to our RD initiatives. To drive innovation and gain efficiencies, we intend to utilize our investments in intellectual property and RD across our market segments. Sales and Marketing Customers We sell our products primarily to OEMs and ODMs. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and cloud service providers, who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see \" Note 4: Operating Segments and Geographic Information \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customerssystems builders that purchase Intel  processors and other products from our distributors. We have a program that allows distributors to sell our microprocessors and other products in small quantities to customers of systems builders. Our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets. Sales Arrangements Our products are sold through sales offices throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, private-label branding, and other matters. Our sales are routinely made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology. Our products are generally shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer, even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related cost of sales is deferred. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, usually 30 days after shipment or delivery. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. Distribution Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers. Backlog Over time, our larger customers have generally moved to lean-inventory or just-in-time operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products. As our customers continue to lower their inventories, our processes to fulfill their orders have evolved to meet their needs. As a result, our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance non-binding commitments from customers as to future purchases. Our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Only a small portion of our orders are non-cancelable, and the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant. Seasonal Trends Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. Marketing Our global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known Intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel  Quark, Intel  Atom, Intel  Celeron  , Intel  Pentium  , Intel  Xeon  , Intel  Xeon Phi, and Intel  Itanium  trademarks make up our processor brands. We promote brand awareness and preference, and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and press relations. We market to consumer and business audiences, and focus on building awareness and generating demand for new form factors such as all-in-one devices and 2 in 1 systems powered by Intel. Our key messaging focuses on increased performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as connectivity and communications. Purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the Intel Inside  program. This program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Through the Intel Inside program, certain customers are licensed to place Intel  logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel  brands, subject to customers meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers. Intellectual Property Rights and Licensing Intel owns significant intellectual property (IP) and related IP rights around the world that relate to our products, services, RD, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress rights, and maskwork rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. Such efforts can be difficult, however, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right. We have obtained patents in the U.S. and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, and the comparative pace of governments patenting processes, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire; in some cases, our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are granted. As we expand our products into new industries, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products. In addition to developing patents based on our own RD efforts, we purchase patents from third parties to supplement our patent portfolio. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other IP, may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our component-level and platform products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability We have a long history of leadership in corporate responsibility and set ambitious goals and drive improvements in key focus areas of environmental sustainability, supply chain responsibility, diversity and inclusion, and social impact. We are committed to environmental sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives by working proactively with governments, environmental groups, and industry. To minimize the environmental impact of our global manufacturing operations, we invest in conservation projects and set company-wide environmental targets, seeking to drive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, water use, and waste generation. For the past nine years, we have been the largest voluntary corporate purchaser of green power in the U.S. according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, helping to stimulate the market for green power and reduce energy costs. We seek to reduce the environmental impact of our products through product ecology and e-waste initiatives and by designing products with improved energy-efficient performance, which helps us meet customer needs and identify market expansion opportunities. We believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the worlds environmental challenges, and we are joining forces with others to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to address climate change and water conservation. We are committed to advancing supply chain responsibility, as we believe this creates value by reducing risk, improving product quality, and raising the overall performance of our suppliers. Our efforts are designed to protect vulnerable workers throughout the global supply chain and include setting clear supplier expectations, investing in assessments, audits, and capability-building programs, and collectively addressing issues through our leadership in the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC). We have also led the industry on the conflict minerals issue and have worked extensively since 2008 to put in place processes and systems to develop ethical sourcing of tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold for Intel and to prevent profits from the sale of those minerals from funding conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. Since 2013, we have manufactured microprocessors that are DRC conflict-free for tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold. We continue our work to establish responsible mineral supply chains for our company as well as our industry. Diversity and inclusion are integral parts of our corporate strategy and vision. We believe that investing in training, diversity, benefits programs, and education helps us to attract and retain a talented workforce. In 2015, Intel set a goal to achieve full representation of women and underrepresented minorities in our U.S. workforce by 2020, reflecting talent available in the marketplace. We plan to spend $300 million to support this goal and accelerate diversity and inclusionnot just at Intel, but across the technology industry at large. We and the Intel Foundation, a charitable organization, advance social impact initiatives and collaborative engagements to empower the next generation of innovators and expand economic opportunity for young people around the world through programs that increase access to technology skills and provide hands-on innovation experiences. Our social impact initiatives build trust with key stakeholders, support our long-term talent and diversity objectives, and support expansion of future market opportunities.

RISK FACTORS The following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and our financial statements and the related notes. Changes in product demand can adversely affect our financial results. Demand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Changes  in the demand for our products may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us to write down the value of our assets. Our platform products are used across different market segments, and demand for our platforms may vary within or among our client computing, data center, Internet of Things, and other market segments. It is difficult to anticipate the impact of these changes, as demand may increase in one or more market segments while decreasing in others. Important factors that could lead to variation in the demand for our products include changes in: ##TABLE_START  business conditions, including downturns in the computing industry, or in the global or regional economies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  consumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the level of our customers inventories; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  customer product needs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing products; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the technology supply chain, including supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. ##TABLE_END We face significant competition. The  industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we do not anticipate and respond to these developments, our competitive position may weaken, and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete. Additionally, a number of business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships, in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. Consolidation in the industry could lead to fewer customers, partners or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results. In recent years, our business focus has expanded and now includes the design and production of platforms and other products for the data center, Internet of Things, and memory market segments, including FPGA products, connectivity products, and a number of other products and services for a wide range of connected devices. As a result, we face new sources of competition, including, in certain of these market segments, from incumbent competitors with established customer bases and greater brand recognition. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, integration, and energy efficiency of our products, as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain consumer and market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments. To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful RD effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors. For example, we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, including the construction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers. Our RD efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems, and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, and the products we invest in and develop may not be well-received by customers. Our RD investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years, and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. Additionally, the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for, or pricing of, our products. If we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including increased costs and reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets. Changes in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results. Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due to differences in product features or manufacturing costs. For example, our platform product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those based on Intel Quark or Intel Atom processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon processors. If demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platforms in any of our market segments, our gross margin and revenue would decrease. In addition, when products are introduced, they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross margin. We operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions. Global or regional conditions may harm our financial results. We have manufacturing, assembly and test, RD, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 78% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 . As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including: ##TABLE_START  global and local economic conditions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, human rights concerns, and terrorist activity; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  natural disasters, public health issues, and other catastrophic events; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  government restrictions on, or nationalization of our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  differing employment practices and labor issues; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  formal or informal imposition of new or revised export and/or import and doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions and tariffs, which could be changed without notice; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increased uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad, such as recent U.S. legislation and policies and the United Kingdom's referendum to withdraw from the European Union (\"Brexit\"). ##TABLE_END We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, which may differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; anti-competition; advertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements may be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, and/or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. We may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as overseas capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations or systems could be disrupted by natural disasters; industrial accidents; geopolitical conditions; terrorist activity; public health issues; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, or telecommunications providers; or other catastrophic events. Such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to enable us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions. We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. In addition, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. We are vulnerable to product and manufacturing-related risks. Due to the variability in demand for our products and the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we may be unable to timely respond to fluctuations in demand. Our operations have high costs that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to manufacturing, such as facility construction and equipment, RD, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. Our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. Factory-planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation. Conversely, if product demand increases, we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand. Our revenue and gross margin can also be affected by the timing of our product introductions and related expenses, including marketing expenses. We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology. We may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. We are continually engaged in the transition from our existing process to the next-generation process technology. This consistent innovation involves significant expense and carries inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process technologies, development and production timing delays, lower than anticipated manufacturing yields, and product defects and errata. Disruptions in the production process can also result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses, interruption in our supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditionsall of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues can lead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand, which could adversely impact our business and the results from operations. We face supply chain risks. Thousands of suppliers provide materials and equipment that we use in production and other aspects of our business. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials. However, for certain materials, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. In addition, consolidation among suppliers could impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us. The inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. Production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations. Our manufacturing operations and ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by IP or other litigation between our suppliers, where an injunction against Intel or a supplier could interrupt the availability of goods or services supplied to Intel by others. We also rely on third-party providers to manufacture and assemble and test certain components or products, particularly those related to networking, mobile and communications, programmable semiconductor solutions, and NAND flash memory. If any of these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely or cost-effective basis, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions that could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, there are regulatory and other requirements, restrictions, and requests from various constituencies regarding sourcing practices and supplier conduct, with a trend toward expanding the scope of materials and locations where materials originate, regulating supplier behaviors, and increasing the required disclosures regarding such matters by public companies. Increased regulation and public pressure in this area would cause our compliance costs to increase and could negatively affect our reputation given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials, but do not directly control their procurement or employment practices. We are subject to the risks of product defects, errata or other product issues. Product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) may result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or attain through acquisitions, may also contain defects. We could face risks if products that we design, manufacture or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies, or applications through the Internet of Things, including wearables, drones and transportation, and industrial and consumer uses. Costs from defects, errata, or other product issues could include: ##TABLE_START  writing off some or all of the value of inventory; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  recalling products that have been shipped; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  providing product replacements or modifications; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reimbursing customers for certain costs they incur; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies. ##TABLE_END These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and result in delay or loss of revenue. Any product defects, errata, or other issues could also damage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay product releases, or result in legal liability. The announcement of product defects or errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of our components or for other reasons. Any of these occurrences could harm our business and financial results. In addition, although we maintain liability insurance, our coverage has certain exclusions and/or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not covered by insurance could be large, which could harm our financial condition. We are subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations. The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in: ##TABLE_START  regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  suspension of production; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reputational challenges; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  restrictions on our operations or sales. ##TABLE_ENDOur failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements. Environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. For example, climate change regulation could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution control requirements, and increased or new monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. We also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations if, for example, utility companies pass on their costs to their customers. Furthermore, many of our operations are located in semi-arid regions that may become increasingly vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. Our fabrication facilities require significant water use and, while we recycle and reuse a portion of the water used, we may have difficulties obtaining sufficient water to fulfill our operational needs due the lack of available infrastructure. We are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. We may be unable to enforce or protect our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others to protect our IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that the IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to the opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in the other party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. Governments may adopt regulationsand governments or courts may render decisionsrequiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in RD, product development, and marketing could be reduced. Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights. Companies in our industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Our competitors may have licenses to our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses may exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired. Third parties may assert claims based on IP rights against us or our products, which could harm our business. We may face claims based on IP rights from individuals and companies, including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies. We are normally engaged in a number of litigation matters involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, whether or not meritorious, could cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve, and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. In addition, we may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. As a result of IP rights claims, we could: ##TABLE_START  pay monetary damages, including payments to satisfy indemnification obligations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  enter into settlement and license agreements, which agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. ##TABLE_END These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed. We rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of our products include third-party IP and/or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party IP, or to use such IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. We are subject to the risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. We may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. As described in \" Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and distracting to management. We must attract, retain, and motivate key employees. To be competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based and other performance-based incentive awards such as restricted stock units (RSUs) and cash bonuses. Also key to our employee hiring and retention is our ability to build and maintain an inclusive business culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. If our share-based or other compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. We are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks. Third parties attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network, products, services, and infrastructure. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our information technology (IT) systems. Additionally, malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide. Due to the widespread use of our products and the high profile of our commercial security products, we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others. We believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication. From time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure. To date, none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations. In some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and/or changes or patches to our products and services, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. Such incidents, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, reduced inventory value, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. Publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers or users, and reduce demand for our products and services. We may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. We are subject to risks associated with transactions. We invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments. We make investments in public and private companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. Companies in which we invest range from early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on the availability to the company of additional funding on favorable terms, or a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. If any of the companies in which we invest fail, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions could fail to achieve strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and harm our results of operations. In pursuing  our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions, such as joint ventures. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. In addition to opportunity costs, these transactions involve large challenges and risks, including risks that: ##TABLE_START  the transaction may not advance our business strategy; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may be unable to identify opportunities on terms acceptable to us; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may not realize a satisfactory return; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may experience disruption of our ongoing operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may be unable to retain key personnel; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may experience difficulty in integrating new employees, business systems, and technology; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  acquired businesses may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our due diligence process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may have difficulty entering new market segments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may be unable to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses; and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  there may be unknown, underestimated, and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities. ##TABLE_END When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed-upon terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expense, or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, resulting in a loss on the transaction. If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to factors such as: ##TABLE_START  failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  IP disputes or other litigation; or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulties obtaining financing for the transaction. ##TABLE_END We are subject to sales-related risks. We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion  of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added resellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors) as well as OEMs, ODMs and Internet service providers. We depend on many distributors to help us create end customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products may be limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our products may not be easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties may sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. They may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position. We face risks related to business transactions with U.S. government entities. We receive proceeds from services and products we provide to the U.S. government. U.S. government demand and payment may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations. U.S. government contracts are subject to oversight, including special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, and security. Failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspensions, or debarment from future U.S. government business. Our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies. The methods, estimates, and judgments used in applying accounting policies are subject to significant risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and changes that could affect our financial position and results of operations. For more information, see \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in Part II, Item 7 and \"Note 2: Accounting Policies\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income. A number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including: ##TABLE_START  changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the resolution of issues arising from tax audits; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in available tax credits; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-U.S. income and expenses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. ##TABLE_END We may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases. The amount, timing, and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposessuch as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend paymentsand because of changes in cash flows and changes in tax laws. Workforce restructuring actions may be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our financial results. In response to the business environment and to accomplish our strategic objectives, we have announced restructurings of our operations and have made other adjustments to our workforce. We may pursue similar actions in the future, and such workforce changes can result in restructuring charges in addition to those described in \" Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Any such workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity, which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if our restructurings are perceived negatively, our corporate reputation and ability to attract employees could suffer. Moreover, we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans, or do so within the expected time frame. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations with regard to our restructuring activity include: ##TABLE_START  timing and execution of plans and programs that may be subject to local labor law requirements, including consultation with appropriate works councils; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  assumptions related to severance, post-retirement, and relocation costs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  future acquisitions, dispositions, or investments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  new business initiatives and changes in product roadmap, development, and manufacturing; and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  assumptions related to cost savings, product demand, and operating efficiencies. ##TABLE_ENDThere are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls. We do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If our controls become inadequate, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, our reputation may be adversely affected, our business and operating results could be harmed, and the market price of our stock could decline. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

Incremental construction and equipment installation are required to ready the facility for its intended use. For more information on our wafer fabrication and our assembly and test facilities, see \"Manufacturing and Assembly and Test\" in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.

As of February 7, 2017 , there were approximately 125,000 registered holders of record of Intels common stock. A substantially greater number of holders of Intel common stock are \"street name\" or beneficial holders, whose shares of record are held by banks, brokers, and other financial institutions. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to  $65.0 billion in shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. As of December 31, 2016 , $6.8 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit.  Common stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase plan during each quarter of 2016 was as follows: ##TABLE_START Period  Total Number of Shares Purchased (In Millions)  Average Price Paid Per Share  Dollar Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased (In Millions) December 27, 2015  April 2, 2016  26.9  $ 29.80  $ 8,592 April 3, 2016  July 2, 2016  25.9  $ 30.76  $ 7,793 July 3, 2016  October 1, 2016  13.1  $ 35.29  $ 7,332 October 2, 2016  December 31, 2016  15.0  $ 35.50  $ 6,800 Total  80.9  $ 32.05   ##TABLE_ENDCommon stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase plan during Q4 2016 was as follows: ##TABLE_START Period  Total Number of Shares Purchased (In Millions)  Average Price Paid Per Share  Dollar Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans (In Millions) October 2, 2016 - October 29, 2016  4.2  $ 36.36  $ 7,180 October 30, 2016 - November 26, 2016  5.7  $ 34.73  $ 6,982 November 27, 2016  December 31, 2016  5.1  $ 35.66  $ 6,800 Total  15.0  $ 35.50   ##TABLE_ENDWe issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our consolidated financial statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase plan and accordingly are not included in the common stock repurchase totals in the preceding table.

The increase was driven by the inclusion of PSG and growth in the DCG, CCG, and IOTG businesses. Net income for 2016 was $10.3 billion , and cash flow from operations was $21.8 billion . ##TABLE_START  CCG revenue was $32.9 billion , up  2% , with platform volume down  10% and platform average selling prices up  11% . DCG revenue was $17.2 billion , up  8% , with platform volume up  8% and platform average selling prices down  1% . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Gross margin dollars were $36.2 billion , up  $1.5 billion from 2015 . Gross margin of 60.9% was down 1.7 points  from 2015 . The gross margin percentage point decrease was driven primarily by Altera and other amortization of acquisition-related charges, lower NSG gross margin, higher factory start-up costs (primarily on 10nm), higher product warranty and intellectual property charges, and CCG non-platform products. The decrease was partially offset by lower platform unit costs, platform volume, and higher platform average selling prices. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  RD and MGA totaled $21.1 billion , up 5% from a year ago. RD and MGA were 35.6% of revenue in 2016, down approximately 1 point from 2015. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Restructuring and other charges were $1.9 billion , primarily driven by our 2016 Restructuring Program. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Earnings per share of $2.12 were down  21 cents , or 9% from a year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by higher restructuring and other charges, higher spending, and higher amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. The decrease was partially offset by platform volume and higher platform average selling prices. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Record cash flow from operations in 2016 was approximately $21.8 billion . During 2016 , we acquired Altera and other smaller acquisitions for $15.5 billion . We purchased $9.6 billion in capital assets, paid $4.9 billion in dividends, and repurchased $2.6 billion in stock. We issued $2.8 billion of long-term debt and assumed $1.5 billion as part of the Altera acquisition. ##TABLE_END 2016 has been a transformative year for Intel. We have made strides to move from a PC centric company to one that is powering the cloud and billions of smart, connected devices. We are building on our strong position in client computing and are investing for growth in the data center, Internet of Things market segments, and disruptive differentiated memory technology. To accelerate our transformation, in Q2 2016 , we announced the 2016 Restructuring Program, which is on track to reduce our headcount and generate savings. We are reallocating these savings to our growth segments, such as the data center and Internet of Things, and are continuing to invest in areas that extend our leadership in Moore's Law and expand market opportunities in areas such as memory and autonomous driving.  In Q1 2016, we completed the acquisition of Altera, a global semiconductor company that designs and sells programmable semiconductors and related products, and subsequently formed PSG. We have worked to integrate Altera throughout 2016 and the business continues to deliver new products and to grow. In September 2016, to further accelerate our transformation and focus our business on core strategic areas, we announced the planned divestiture of ISecG. Our Business Outlook for Q1 2017 and full year 2017 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (RD plus MGA), and capital expenditures. We publish our Business Outlook in our quarterly earnings release. Our Business Outlook and any updates thereto are publicly available on our Investor Relations website,  www.intc.com .

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Intel Security Group Segment Product Overview The ISecG operating segment offers McAfee  software security products designed to deliver innovative solutions that secure computers, mobile devices, and networks around the world from the latest malware and emerging online threats. These products are designed for the protection of consumers, small businesses, and enterprise market segment customers. In 2016 , we launched our next generation of converged endpoint suites, which include cloud-based workloads and further enable new architecture for greater effectiveness. During Q3 2016 , we announced our decision to divest ISecG. The operating results of ISecG will be reported as continued operations until the close of the transaction.

Programmable Solutions Group Segment Product Overview The PSG operating segment was created in Q1 2016 , subsequent to the acquisition of Altera. PSG offers Altera  products and consists of FPGAsincluding SoC FPGAs, which incorporate hard embedded processor coresand complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs) for a broad range of market segments including communications, data center, industrial, military, and automotive. FPGAs and CPLDs are standard semiconductor integrated circuits, or chips, that our customers program to desired logic and processing functions in their electronic systems. In 2016 , PSG launched the Intel  Stratix  10 FPGA product.

Due to the revaluation of deferred revenue to fair value, we excluded revenue of $99 million and associated costs that would have created $64 million of operating income in 2016 . Additionally, we incurred approximately $387 million of additional cost of sales charges during the period that would have been excluded from the operating results in 2016 if the acquired inventory had not been remeasured to fair value upon acquisition and then sold to end customers, resulting in zero margin on that inventory for the period.

The increase was driven by the addition of PSG expenses from the acquisition of Altera, higher investment, net of 2016 restructuring program savings, in strategically important areas such as servers, Internet of Things, new devices, and memory, as well as higher process development costs for our new 7nm process technology. These increases were partially offset by lower depreciation expense due to a change at the beginning of fiscal year 2016 to the estimated useful life of our machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facilities. RD spending increased by $591 million , or 5% , in 2015 compared to 2014 . The increase was due to higher investment in our productsprimarily server, Internet of Things, and new devicesas well as expenses of newly acquired entities and higher process development costs for our 10nm process technology. This increase was partially offset by lower profit-dependent compensation and savings from the implementation of efficiencies within our CCG operating segment. Marketing, General and Administrative MGA expenses increased by $467 million , or 6% , in 2016 compared to 2015 . This increase was primarily due to PSG expenses from the acquisition of Altera. MGA expenses decreased by $206 million in 2015 compared to 2014 . This decrease was due to lower profit-dependent compensation as well as lower expenses from businesses that have been divested.

In Q2 2016, our management approved and commenced the 2016 Restructuring Program to accelerate our transformation from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices. Under this program, we are in the process of closing certain facilities and reducing headcount globally to align our operations with evolving business needs by investing in our growth businesses and improving efficiencies. We expect these actions to be substantially completed by Q2 2017. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Restructuring actions related to this program that were approved in 2016 are expected to impact approximately  15,000  employees. We estimate that the charges incurred to date as part of the 2016 restructuring program will result in net annual headcount savings of approximately $1.6 billion as we re-balance our workforce. On an annual basis, we expect $1.4 billion of these savings will reduce our RD and MGA spending, and the remainder will reduce our cost of sales. We began to realize these savings in Q2 2016 and expect to fully realize these savings by Q2 2017 . We are reallocating these savings to our growth segments, such as the data center and Internet of Things, and are continuing to invest in areas that extend our leadership in Moore's Law and expand market opportunities in areas such as memory and autonomous driving. For further information on the 2016 Restructuring Program, see \" Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 2015 Restructuring Program . During 2015, management approved and commenced implementation of restructuring actions, primarily targeted workforce reductions, as we adjusted resources from areas of disinvestment to areas of investment. This program was completed in 2015. 2013 Restructuring Program . During 2013, management approved and commenced implementation of several restructuring actions, including targeted workforce reductions and the exit of certain businesses and facilities. These actions included the wind down of our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Massachusetts  and the closure of our assembly and test facility in Costa Rica . This program was completed in 2015. Other Charges.  Other charges consist primarily of expenses associated with the planned divestiture of ISecG that was announced in Q3 2016. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation totaled $1.4 billion in 2016 ( $1.3 billion in 2015 and $1.1 billion in 2014 ). Share-based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses. As of December 31, 2016 , unrecognized share-based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Unrecognized Share-Based Compensation Costs  Weighted Average Period Restricted stock units  $ 1,903  1.2 years Stock Purchase Plan  $  2 months ##TABLE_ENDGains (Losses) on Equity Investments and Interest and Other, Net ##TABLE_START Years Ended (In Millions)  Dec 31, 2016  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014 Gains (losses) on equity investments, net  $  $  $ Interest and other, net  $ (444 )  $ (105 )  $ ##TABLE_ENDWe recognized higher net gains on equity investments in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to gains of $407 million related to sales of a portion of our interest in ASML. We recognized lower net gains on equity investments in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower gains on sales of equity investments partially offset by higher gains on third-party merger transactions. We recognized a higher interest and other, net loss in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher interest expense from debt issued or acquired in 2015 and 2016 as well as lower capitalized interest due to lower eligible capital expenditures in 2016. We recognized an interest and other, net loss in 2015 compared to a net gain in 2014 primarily due to higher interest expense, which resulted from the issuance of senior unsecured notes during 2015.

Most of the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was driven by one-time items, a higher proportion of our income from lower tax jurisdictions, and our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain prior years' non-U.S. earnings, which positively impacted our effective income tax rate.  Liquidity and Capital Resources We consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Dec 31, 2016  Dec 26, 2015 Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets  $ 17,099  $ 25,313 Other long-term investments  $ 4,716  $ 1,891 Loans receivable and other  $  $ 1,170 Reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months  $  $ 1,000 Unsettled trade liabilities and other  $  $ Short-term and long-term debt  $ 25,283  $ 22,670 Temporary equity  $  $ Debt as percentage of permanent stockholders equity  38.2 %  37.1 % ##TABLE_ENDMANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Sources and Uses of Cash (In Millions) In summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years Ended (In Millions)  Dec 31, 2016  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014 Net cash provided by operating activities  $ 21,808  $ 19,017  $ 20,418 Net cash used for investing activities  (25,817 )  (8,183 )  (9,905 ) Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities  (5,739 )  1,912  (13,611 ) Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents     (15 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents  $ (9,748 )  $ 12,747  $ (3,113 ) ##TABLE_ENDMANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. For 2016 compared to 2015 , the $2.8 billion  increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to adjustments for non-cash items and changes in working capital, partially offset by lower net income. The adjustments for non-cash items were higher in 2016 primarily due to restructuring and other charges and the change in deferred taxes, partially offset by lower depreciation expense. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2016 compared to 2015 were $2.6 billion  lower due to bonus depreciation on capital assets placed in service, as well as timing of certain tax payments and refunds. For 2015 compared to 2014 , the $1.4 billion  decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital, adjustments for non-cash items, and lower net income. The adjustments for non-cash items were lower due primarily to deferred taxes, partially offset by higher depreciation. Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions. Our capital expenditures were $9.6 billion in 2016 ( $7.3 billion in 2015 and $10.1 billion in 2014 ). The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to our completed acquisition of Altera, net purchases of trading assets in 2016 compared to net sales of trading assets in 2015 , and higher capital expenditures in 2016. This increase was partially offset by lower investments in non-marketable equity investments and collection of loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreements. The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to cash generated by net trading asset activity and lower capital expenditures during 2015 . This activity was partially offset by net available-for-sale activity (which was cash flow neutral in 2015 compared to a source of cash in 2014 ) and higher investments in non-marketable equity investments during 2015 . Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans. Cash was used for financing activities in 2016 compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2015 , primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and the repayment of $1.5 billion of debt in 2016. These amounts were partially offset by repayment of commercial paper in 2015 and fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program. We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to  $65.0 billion in shares of our common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions. During 2016 , we repurchased $2.6 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, compared to $3.0 billion in 2015 . As of December 31, 2016 , $6.8 billion remained available for repurchasing common stock under the existing repurchase authorization limit. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of common stock through employee equity incentive plans totaled $1.1 billion in 2016 compared to $866 million in 2015 . Our total dividend payments were $4.9 billion in 2016 compared to $4.6 billion in 2015 . We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 97 quarters. In January 2017 , our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of common stock for Q1 2017 . The dividend is payable on March 1, 2017 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2017 . Cash was provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to cash used by financing activities in 2014 , primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2015 and fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program in 2015 compared to 2014 . This activity was partially offset by lower proceeds from the sales of common stock in 2015 and repayments of short-term debt in 2015 compared to borrowings in 2014 . MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Liquidity Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. When assessing our sources of liquidity we include investments as shown in the Liquidity and Capital Resources table. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investment-grade securities. Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $5.0 billion . No commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 31, 2016 . On December 21, 2015, we entered into a short-term credit facility to borrow up to $5.0 billion to facilitate the settlement of our acquisition of Altera. Under this credit facility we borrowed $4.0 billion , and the facility was closed in January 2016. In Q2 2016, we issued $2.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes to refinance existing indebtedness, including our 1.95% senior notes due 2016 and a portion of our 1.35% senior notes due 2017 . As of December 31, 2016 , $13.6 billion of our $17.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Of the $13.6 billion held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, approximately $1.5 billion was available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of December 31, 2016 . The remaining amount of non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no U.S. current or deferred taxes have been accrued. This amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the U.S. and future acquisitions of non-U.S. entities. We believe our U.S. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the U.S., and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., such amounts would be subject to U.S. income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes. We believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations Significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Payments Due by Period (In Millions)  Total  Less Than 1 Year  13 Years  35 Years  More Than 5 Years Operating lease obligations  $ 1,226  $  $  $  $ Capital purchase obligations 1  7,529  5,646  1,882    Other purchase obligations and commitments 2  3,038  1,825  1,154    Long-term debt obligations 3  42,020  4,391  2,459  5,854  29,316 Other long-term liabilities 4, 5  1,763     Total 6  $ 55,576  $ 12,932  $ 6,544  $ 6,261  $ 29,839 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 , as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2  Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Debt obligations are classified based on their stated maturity date, regardless of their classification on the consolidated balance sheet s. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $125 million of long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the preceding table. However, long-term income taxes payable, recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non-U.S. income taxes. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 5  Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Expected required contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $36 million to be made during 2017 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2017 are not practicable to estimate. Derivative instruments are excluded from the preceding table, as they do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 6  Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities, except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. ##TABLE_END The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services included in \"Other purchase obligations and commitments\" in the preceding table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements have been excluded from the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table. These obligations include milestone-based co-marketing agreements, contingent funding or payment obligations, and milestone-based equity investment funding (excluding investment funding that is pending regulatory approval). These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the counterparty. As of December 31, 2016 , assuming that all future milestones are met, excluding the ASML milestones mentioned below, the additional required payments would be approximately $694 million . During 2012, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML intended to accelerate the development of EUV lithography, certain of which were amended in 2014. Under the amended agreements, Intel agreed to provide RD funding totaling  829 million  over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from ASML. Our remaining obligation, contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, is approximately 193 million , or $202 million , as of December 31, 2016 . As our obligation is contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, we have excluded this obligation from the preceding table. For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest. During 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. (Tsinghua Unigroup), an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co. Ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop Intel architecture- and communications-based solutions for phones. Subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, we have also agreed to invest up to 9.0 billion Chinese yuan (approximately $1.5 billion as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately 20% of Beijing UniSpreadtrum Technology Ltd. (UniSpreadtrum). During 2015, we invested $966 million to complete the first phase of the equity investment. The second phase of the investment will require additional funding of approximately $500 million ; however, as our obligation is contingent upon regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, it has been excluded from the preceding table. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2016 , we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impact of these risks. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 . Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange Rates We are exposed to currency exchange risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable, and may economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contracts, such as currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains or losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments. We are exposed to currency exchange risks from our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt indebtedness and may use foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage this risk. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies, primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, the Israeli shekel, and the Chinese yuan . We have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-U.S. dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non-U.S. dollar monetary assets and liabilities. We may also hedge currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. We may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as currency forward or option contracts in these hedging programs. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $80 million as of December 31, 2016 (less than $75 million as of December 26, 2015 ). Interest Rates We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and the financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR. We generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixed-rate debt investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns. We may enter into swaps to convert fixed-rate coupon payments into floating-rate coupon payments for our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments. A hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 1.0% , after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $100 million as of December 31, 2016 (an increase of approximately $15 million as of December 26, 2015 ). After taking into account interest rate and currency swaps, a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 (an increase of approximately $1.6 billion as of December 26, 2015 ). The fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher fluctuation in the fair value of our net investment position. Equity Prices Our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities at the inception of our investments. Before we enter into hedge arrangements, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors, as well as the expected timing of disposal, to determine whether hedging is appropriate. Our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives. We also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities. As of December 31, 2016 , the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $6.2 billion ( $6.0 billion as of December 26, 2015 ). Substantially all of our marketable equity investments portfolio as of December 31, 2016 was concentrated in our investment in ASML of $6.1 billion ( $5.7 billion as of December 26, 2015 ). Our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed necessary. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a decline of 30% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $1.9 billion , based on the value as of December 31, 2016 (a decrease in value of approximately $1.8 billion , based on the value as of December 26, 2015 using an assumed decline of 30% ). Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable cost method equity investments had a carrying amount of $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2016 ( $2.9 billion as of December 26, 2015 ) and included our investment in UniSpreadtrum and Cloudera, Inc. (Cloudera) of $966 million and $454 million , respectively ( $966 million and $454 million for UniSpreadtrum and Cloudera, respectively, as of December 26, 2015 ). The carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 ( $1.6 billion as of December 26, 2015 ). A substantial majority of our non-marketable equity method investments balance as of December 31, 2016 was concentrated in our IMFT and Cloudera investments of $849 million and $225 million , respectively ( $872 million and $256 million for IMFT and Cloudera, respectively, as of December 26, 2015 ). Commodity Price Risk Although we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. We may use commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place for our key commodities that mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration. ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Part IV, Item 15. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Intel Corporation at December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Intel Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( 2013 framework ) and our report dated February 17, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP San Jose, California February 17, 2017  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intel Corporation We have audited Intel Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( 2013 framework ) (the COSO criteria). Intel Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Intel Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2016 consolidated financial statements of Intel Corporation and our report dated February 17, 2017 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP San Jose, California February 17, 2017 INTEL CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME ##TABLE_START Years Ended (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  Dec 31, 2016  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014 Net revenue  $ 59,387  $ 55,355  $ 55,870 Cost of sales  23,196  20,676  20,261 Gross margin  36,191  34,679  35,609 Research and development  12,740  12,128  11,537 Marketing, general and administrative  8,397  7,930  8,136 Restructuring and other charges  1,886   Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles    Operating expenses  23,317  20,677  20,262 Operating income  12,874  14,002  15,347 Gains (losses) on equity investments, net    Interest and other, net  (444 )  (105 )  Income before taxes  12,936  14,212  15,801 Provision for taxes  2,620  2,792  4,097 Net income  $ 10,316  $ 11,420  $ 11,704 Basic earnings per share of common stock  $ 2.18  $ 2.41  $ 2.39 Diluted earnings per share of common stock  $ 2.12  $ 2.33  $ 2.31 Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding:       Basic  4,730  4,742  4,901 Diluted  4,875  4,894  5,056 ##TABLE_ENDSee accompanying notes.

INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1: Basis of Presentation We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal year 2016 was a 53-week fiscal year, and the first quarter of 2016 was a 14-week quarter. Fiscal years 2015 and 2014 were 52-week years. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Intel Corporation (Intel) and our subsidiaries. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. During our 2015 annual assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment, we determined that the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facilities should be increased from 4 to 5 years based on the lengthening of the process technology cadence resulting in longer node transitions on both 14 nanometer (nm) and 10nm products. We have also increased the re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. This change in estimate was applied prospectively, effective at the beginning of 2016. During 2016 , this change increased our operating income by approximately $1.3 billion , our net income by approximately $950 million , and our diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.19 . Note 2: Accounting Policies  Revenue Recognition We recognize net product revenue when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement, delivery has occurred, pricing is deemed fixed, and collection is considered probable. We record pricing allowances, including discounts based on contractual arrangements with customers, when we recognize revenue as a reduction to both accounts receivable and net revenue. Because of frequent sales price reductions and rapid technology obsolescence in our industry, we defer product revenue and related costs of sales from component sales made to distributors under agreements allowing price protection or right of return until the distributors sell the merchandise. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. We include shipping charges billed to customers in net revenue, and include the related shipping costs in cost of sales. Revenue from license agreements on our McAfee products generally includes service and support agreements for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period in which services are provided. Revenue derived from online subscription products is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period. Professional services revenue is recognized as services are performed or, if required, upon customer acceptance. For arrangements with multiple elements, including software licenses, maintenance, and/or services, revenue is allocated across the separately identified deliverables and may be recognized or deferred. When vendor-specific objective evidence does not exist for undelivered elements such as maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Direct costs, such as costs related to revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements associated with license arrangements, as well as component costs associated with product revenue and sales commissions, are deferred and recognized over the same period that the related revenue is recognized. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Inventories We compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We apply judgment in the valuation of our inventory which includes the following critical accounting estimates. Intel has a product development life cycle that corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities, and associated costs, change in nature from research and development (RD) to cost of sales. This impacts the timing of when manufacturing costs can be capitalized as inventory. For a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. This milestone is known as product release qualification (PRQ). We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. Prior to PRQ, costs that do not meet the criteria for RD are included in cost of sales in the period incurred. If the point at which we estimate that inventory meets PRQ criteria changes in the future, the timing and recognition of the manufacturing costs would shift between RD and costs of sales. To determine which manufacturing overhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine what normal capacity levels are at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; therefore, it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. Inventory reserves increased by approximately $270 million in 2016 compared to 2015 . The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The demand forecast is utilized in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. The estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin. Property, Plant and Equipment We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets and we capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that asset cost. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment. We apply judgment in the valuation of our property, plant and equipment, which includes the following critical accounting estimates. ##TABLE_START  The estimated economic useful lives of our property, plant and equipment can materially impact our depreciation expense. Accordingly, at least annually, we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of these assets, considering factors such as the process technology cadence between node transitions and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. We had a change in estimate in 2016 related to the useful lives of machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facilities. For further information, see \" Note 1: Basis of Presentation .\" ##TABLE_END As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets new, shorter useful lives. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) ##TABLE_START  We assess property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows arising from the use of that asset grouping. If an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. We measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset grouping carrying value and its fair value. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We have certain facilities, included within construction in progress, being held in a safe state and not currently in use that we have plans to place into service at a future date. The time at which these assets are placed into service depends on our existing manufacturing capacity, market demand for our products, and where we are in the transition of products on our roadmap. Management makes judgments about the timing of when these facilities will be readied for their intended use and placed into service for the manufacturing of our products. Depreciation is not recognized on these assets and they are not eligible for capitalized interest when construction is on hold. ##TABLE_ENDFair Value Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value, except for cost method investments, cost method loans receivable, equity method investments, grants receivable, and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months.  The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are: ##TABLE_START  Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use LIBOR-based yield curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as a discounted cash flow models. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data. ##TABLE_END Our policy is to reflect transfers between the fair value hierarchy levels at the beginning of the period. Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can include investments such as corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and reverse repurchase agreements. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Trading Assets Marketable debt instruments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument, or when the marketable debt instrument itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. The gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net. We also designate certain floating-rate securitized financial instruments, primarily asset-backed securities, as trading assets. Available-for-Sale Investments Available-for-sale investments are classified within cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, or long-term investments based on the remaining maturity of the investment. Investments designated as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except as noted in the \"Other-Than-Temporary Impairment\" section. We determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level. Our available-for-sale investments include: ##TABLE_START  Marketable debt instruments when the interest rate and foreign currency risks are not hedged at the inception of the investment or when our criteria for designation as trading assets are not met. We record the interest income and realized gains or losses on the sale of these instruments in interest and other, net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketable equity securities when there is no plan to sell or hedge the investment at the time of original classification. We acquire these equity investments to promote business and strategic objectives. We record the realized gains or losses on the sale or exchange of marketable equity securities in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_ENDNon-Marketable and Other Equity Investments We regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2016 ( $4.5 billion as of December 26, 2015 ). Our non-marketable equity and other equity investments are included in other long-term assets. We account for non-marketable equity and other equity investments for which we do not have control over the investee as: ##TABLE_START  Equity method investments when we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Equity method investments include marketable and non-marketable investments. Our proportionate share of the income or loss is recognized on a one-quarter lag and is recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-marketable cost method investments when the equity method does not apply. ##TABLE_END Significant judgment is required to identify whether an impairment exists in the valuation of our non-marketable equity investments portfolio, and therefore we consider this a critical accounting estimate. Our quarterly analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investee's fair value. Qualitative analysis of our investments involves understanding the financial performance and near-term prospects of the investee, changes in general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, and the management and governance structure of the investee. Quantitative assessments of the fair value of our investments are developed using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of comparable financial metrics of private and public companies and recent financing rounds. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates regarding the investees' revenue, costs, and discount rates. Our assessment of these factors in determining whether an impairment exists could change in the future due to new developments or changes in applied assumptions. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Our available-for-sale investments and non-marketable and other equity investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. Impairments affect earnings as follows: ##TABLE_START  Marketable debt instruments when the fair value is below amortized cost and we intend to sell the instrument, or when it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument (that is, a credit loss exists). When we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument, we separate other-than-temporary impairments into amounts representing credit losses, which are recognized in interest and other, net, and amounts not related to credit losses, which are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketable equity securities include the consideration of general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is below cost, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of value in the foreseeable future. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and the business outlook for, the investee, which may include industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and changes in the investees credit rating. We record other-than-temporary impairments on marketable equity securities and marketable equity method investments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-marketable equity investments based on our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment, and qualitative and quantitative analysis of the operating performance of the investee; adverse changes in market conditions and the regulatory or economic environment; changes in operating structure or management of the investee; additional funding requirements; and the investees ability to remain in business. Impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $184 million in 2016 ( $166 million in 2015 and $140 million in 2014 ). ##TABLE_END We record other-than-temporary impairments for non-marketable cost method investments and equity method investments in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Derivative Financial Instruments Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk, commodity price risk, and credit risk. We may enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. A master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. We may also enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. For presentation on our consolidated balance sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments are presented at fair value on a gross basis and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. Cash Flow Hedges We may use foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards and currency interest rate swaps, to hedge exposures for the following items: ##TABLE_START  variability in the U.S.-dollar equivalent of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated cash flows associated with our forecasted operating and capital purchases spending; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  coupon and principal payments for our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated indebtedness. ##TABLE_END We may use commodity derivatives to hedge future cash flow exposures to the variability in commodity prices as well as interest rate contracts, such as treasury rate lock agreements or interest rate swaps, to hedge the variability in cash flows driven by interest rate risk for our future or existing indebtedness. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The after-tax gains or losses from the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedge transaction. For foreign currency contracts hedging our capital purchases, forward points are excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment. For options, time value is generally excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment. Ineffective portions of cash flow hedges, as well as amounts excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment, are recognized in earnings in interest and other, net. If the cash flow hedge transactions become probable not to occur, the corresponding amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be immediately reclassified to interest and other, net. These derivatives are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item. Fair Value Hedges We may use interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge against changes in the fair value on certain of our fixed-rate indebtedness attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate. The gains or losses on these hedges, as well as the offsetting losses or gains related to the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings in the current period, primarily in interest and other, net. These derivatives are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from financing activities. Non-Designated Hedges We may use foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities, non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets, and non-U.S.-dollar-denominated loans receivables recognized at fair value. We may also use interest rate contracts to hedge interest rate risk related to our U.S.-dollar-denominated fixed-rate debt instruments classified as trading assets. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded through earnings in the line item on the consolidated statements of income to which the derivatives most closely relate, primarily in interest and other, net. Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the changes in the fair value of the related derivatives. We may use total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related deferred compensation liabilities, both of which are recorded in cost of sales and operating expenses. Deferred compensation liabilities are included in other accrued liabilities. We may use warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives as part of our equity market risk management program. We recognize changes in the fair value of such derivatives in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. These types of derivatives are either classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within cash flows from operating activities or investing activities, depending on the activity the exposure is most closely associated with. Securities Lending We may enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions, generally to facilitate hedging and certain investment and financing transactions. Selected securities may be loaned, secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investment assets on our consolidated balance sheets. For lending agreements collateralized by cash and cash equivalents, collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. For lending agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the collateral as an asset or a liability, unless the collateral is repledged. Loans Receivable We may enter into loan transactions with third parties. These loans are classified within other current assets or other long-term assets. We may elect the fair value option when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at the inception of the loan with a related derivative instrument. When the fair value option is not elected, the loans are carried at amortized cost. We measure interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method, which is based on the effective yield of the loans rather than the stated coupon rate. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, derivative financial instruments, loans receivable, reverse repurchase agreements, and trade receivables. We may enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterpartys relative credit standing. As required per our investment policy, substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investment-grade instruments. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterpartys obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of December 31, 2016 , our total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding money market funds invested in U.S. treasury and U.S. agency securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities, did not exceed $700 million . To further reduce credit risk, we obtain and secure available collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions, when we deem it appropriate. A substantial majority  of our trade receivables are derived from sales to original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers. We also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries. We believe that the net accounts receivable balances from our three largest customers ( 31% in 2016 ) do not represent a significant credit risk, based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. For more information about the customers that represent our accounts receivable balance, see \" Note 4: Operating Segments and Geographic Information \" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe that credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Business Combinations We allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. We consider this a critical accounting estimate because it involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments that could materially affect the timing or amounts recognized in our financial statements. The most subjective areas include determining the fair value of the following: ##TABLE_START  intangible assets, including valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, and discount rates, as well as the estimated useful life of the intangible assets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inventory; property, plant and equipment; pre-existing liabilities or legal claims; deferred revenue; and contingent consideration, each as may be applicable; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  goodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. ##TABLE_END Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies. We allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Goodwill Application of the goodwill impairment test is considered a critical accounting estimate, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of fair value for each reporting unit.  We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, which includes evaluating qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment of a reporting units goodwill. The reporting units carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. For reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. Additionally, as part of this assessment, we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting units fair value. For reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. Our goodwill impairment test considers both the income method and the market method to estimate a reporting units fair value. The income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following major assumptions and inputs: revenue, based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share; estimated costs; and appropriate discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. Our estimates of market segment growth, our market segment share, and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and a variety of external sources. The same estimates are also used in our business planning and forecasting process. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data. The market method is based on financial multiples and transaction prices of comparable companies. Although there were no specific qualitative indicators of impairment for our reporting units, we elected to perform a step 1 impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2016 . These reporting units were all deemed to have fair values that substantially exceeded their carrying value. Upon any reorganization of our operating segments, we re-evaluate our reporting units and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value approach. Identified Intangible Assets We amortize all acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life based on economic benefit. Acquisition-related in-process RD assets represent the fair value of incomplete RD projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition; initially, these are classified as \"in-process research and development\" that are not subject to amortization. Once these RD projects are completed, the asset balances are transferred from \"in-process research and development\" to \"acquisition-related developed technology\" and are subject to amortization from this point forward. The asset balances relating to projects that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to RD. We perform a quarterly review of significant finitelived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. We consider the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets a critical accounting estimate. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Our annual impairment assessment occurs in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinite-lived intangible assets, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If necessary, a quantitative impairment test is performed to compare the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset with its carrying value. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Advertising Cooperative advertising programs reimburse customers for marketing activities for certain of our products. We accrue cooperative advertising obligations and record the costs at the same time that the related revenue is recognized. We record cooperative advertising costs as marketing, general and administrative (MGA) expenses to the extent that an advertising benefit separate from the revenue transaction can be identified and the fair value of that advertising benefit received is determinable. We record any excess in cash paid to customers over the fair value of the advertising benefit we receive as a reduction in revenue. Advertising costs, including direct marketing costs, recorded within MGA expenses were $1.8 billion in 2016 ( $1.8 billion in 2015 and $1.8 billion in 2014 ). Employee Equity Incentive Plans We use the straight-line attribution method to recognize share-based compensation over the service period of the award. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock units (RSUs), we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and RSUs with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award. Income Taxes We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We apply judgment in the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes which includes the following critical accounting estimates. We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes. We use a two-step process to recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether, based on the technical merits of the position, the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on examination, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of income. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. We have not recognized U.S. deferred income taxes on certain undistributed non-U.S. earnings because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. Remittances of non-U.S. earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our non-U.S. and U.S. operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-U.S. earnings, which would be subject to U.S. income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes. Loss Contingencies We are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims, liabilities related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product defects, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable as a critical accounting estimate. We review the status of each significant matter quarterly and we may revise our estimates. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 3: Recent Accounting Standards  Accounting Standards Adopted ##TABLE_START Standard/Description Effective Date and Adoption Considerations Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters Income Taxes - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . This amended standard requires that we classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and non-current. This amended standard was early adopted in the first quarter of 2016 on a retrospective basis. As a result of the adoption, we made the following adjustments to the consolidated 2015 balance sheet: a $2.0 billion decrease to current deferred tax assets, a $430 million increase to non-current deferred tax assets, a $21 million decrease to current deferred tax liabilities, and a decrease of $1.6 billion to non-current deferred tax liabilities. ##TABLE_ENDAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted ##TABLE_START Standard/Description Effective Date and Adoption Considerations Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters Revenue Recognition - Contracts with Customers. This standard was issued to achieve a consistent application of revenue recognition within the U.S., resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by reporting companies under U.S. GAAP. Under the new model, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Effective in the first quarter of 2018. We plan to adopt the standard retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application (\"modified retrospective\" approach). Our assessment has identified a change in revenue recognition timing on our component sales made to distributors. We expect to recognize revenue when we deliver to the distributor rather than deferring recognition until the distributor sells the components. On the date of initial application, we will remove the deferred net revenue on component sales made to distributors through a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. We expect the revenue deferral, historically recognized in the following period, to be offset by the acceleration of revenue recognition as control of the product transfers to our customer. Our assessment has also identified a change in expense recognition timing related to payments we make to our customers for distinct services they perform as part of cooperative advertising programs. We expect to recognize the expense for cooperative advertising in the period the marketing activities occur. We currently recognize the expense in the period the customer is entitled to participate in the program, which coincides with the period of sale. On the date of initial adoption, we will capitalize the expense of cooperative advertising not performed through a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. We expect the recognition of capitalized advertising to offset the deceleration in expense recognition until the marketing services are performed. We will continue our assessment, operate parallel systems and processes, as well as finalize our evaluation of any changes to our accounting policies and disclosures. This excludes our planned divestiture of Intel Security Group (ISecG). Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement. Requires changes to the accounting for financial instruments that primarily affect equity investments, financial liabilities measured using the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for such instruments. Effective in the first quarter of 2018. Certain elements of the new standard are required to be adopted using a modified-retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Other elements will be adopted prospectively. We expect marketable equity securities, previously classified as available-for-sale equity investments, to be measured and recorded at fair value and all unrealized gains or losses previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be recorded in earnings. We are continuing to assess the overall impacts of the new standard, including the impact to our significant accounting policies with regard to non-marketable equity securities classified as cost method investments. ##TABLE_ENDINTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) ##TABLE_START Standard/Description Effective Date and Adoption Considerations Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Asset Transfers Other Than Inventory . This accounting standard update is aimed at recognizing the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory when they occur. This removes the exception to postpone recognition until the asset has been sold to an outside party. Effective in the first quarter of 2018. The standard update is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We have not yet determined the impact of the new standard. Leases . This new lease accounting standard requires that we recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. Effective in the first quarter of 2019. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition that includes certain optional practical expedients. We expect the valuation of right of use assets and lease liabilities, previously described as operating leases, to be the present value of our forecasted future lease commitments. We are continuing to assess the overall impacts of the new standard, including the discount rate to be applied in these valuations. ##TABLE_ENDNote 4: Operating Segments and Geographic Information  Our operating segments as of December 31, 2016 included: ##TABLE_START  Client Computing Group (CCG)   Intel Security Group (ISecG)  Data Center Group (DCG)   Programmable Solutions Group (PSG)  Internet of Things Group (IOTG)   All Other  Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG)   New Technology Group (NTG) ##TABLE_ENDDuring the first quarter of 2016 , we formed PSG as a result of our acquisition of Altera Corporation (Altera). For further information, see \" Note 10: Acquisitions and Divestitures .\" All prior-period amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance starting in fiscal year 2016 . In the third quarter of 2016 , we announced our planned divestiture of ISecG, which we expect to complete in the second quarter of 2017 . For further information, see \" Note 10: Acquisitions and Divestitures .\" The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The CODM allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about its revenue and operating income (loss). We manage our business activities primarily based on a product segmentation basis. We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from platforms, which is our principal product and source of revenue across our CCG, DCG, and IOTG operating segments. CCG and DCG are our reportable operating segments. IOTG, NSG, ISecG, and PSG do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. The NTG operating segment does not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as a reportable segment and NTG results are included within the \"all other\" category. We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments. The \"all other\" category includes revenue and expenses such as: ##TABLE_START  results of operations from NTG; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  amounts included within restructuring and other charges;  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a portion of employee benefits, compensation, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments;  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  divested businesses for which discrete operating results are not regularly reviewed by our CODM;  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives, including our foundry business; and  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.  ##TABLE_ENDINTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. As our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segments operating income (loss) results. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Except for these differences, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.

We computed diluted earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock for our 2005 debentures are determined by applying the if-converted method. However, as our 2009 debentures require settlement of the principal amount of the debt in cash upon conversion, with the conversion premium paid in cash or stock at our option, potentially dilutive shares of common stock are determined by applying the treasury stock method. In all years presented, potentially dilutive securities whose effect would have been antidilutive are insignificant and are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. In all years presented, we included our 2009 debentures in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of common stock because the average market price was above the conversion price. We could potentially exclude the 2009 debentures in the future if the average market price is below the conversion price.

Most of the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was driven by one-time items, a higher proportion of our income from lower tax jurisdictions, and our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain prior years' non-U.S. earnings, which positively impacted our effective income tax rate.  Income in certain non-U.S. countries is fully exempt from income taxes for a limited period of time due to eligible activities and certain capital investment actions. These full tax exemptions expire at various dates through 2023 ; however, the exemptions in certain countries are eligible for renewal. In 2016 , the tax benefit attributable to tax holidays was $77 million ( $85 million for 2015 and $166 million for 2014 ) with a $0.02 impact on diluted earnings per share ( $0.02 for 2015 and $0.03 for 2014 ). During 2016 , net income tax benefits attributable to equity-based compensation transactions that were allocated to stockholders equity totaled $154 million (net benefits of $172 million in 2015 and net benefits of $103 million in 2014 ). INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Deferred and Current Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes.

The valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016 included allowances related to unrealized state credit carryforwards of $839 million and matters related to our non-U.S. subsidiaries of $114 million . As of December 31, 2016 , our federal, state, and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $321 million , $116 million , and $378 million , respectively. The majority of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The remaining non-U.S., as well as the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, expire at various dates through 2037 . A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. relates to acquisitions and, as a result, is limited in the amount that can be recognized in any one year. The non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards include $215 million that is not likely to be recovered and has been reduced by a valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2016 , we had not recognized U.S. deferred income taxes on a cumulative total of $46.4 billion of undistributed earnings and other basis differences for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which includes the impact of the Altera acquisition. Determining the unrecognized deferred tax liability in these non-U.S. subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested is not practicable. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest those earnings and other basis differences in operations outside the U.S. Current income taxes receivable of $86 million as of December 31, 2016 ( $468 million as of December 26, 2015 ) is included in other current assets. Current income taxes payable of $329 million as of December 31, 2016 ( $272 million as of December 26, 2015 ) is included in other accrued liabilities. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Long-term income taxes payable of $125 million as of December 31, 2016 ( $114 million as of December 26, 2015 ) is included in other long-term liabilities, which includes uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and non-U.S. tax credits, and may also include other long-term tax liabilities that are not uncertain but have not yet been paid.

If the remaining balance of $154 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2016 ( $101 million as of December 26, 2015 ) were recognized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $87 million ( insignificant as of December 26, 2015 ) and a reduction in the effective tax rate. Interest, penalties and accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in periods presented Our tax policy is to comply with the laws, regulations, and filing requirements of all jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain U.S. federal and non-U.S. tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could significantly increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. However, the estimated impact of income tax expense and net income is not expected to be significant. We file federal, state, and non-U.S. tax returns. For non-U.S. tax returns, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2002 . For federal and state tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2004 . We have filed petitions before the U.S. Tax Court relating to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an inter-company cost-sharing transaction for certain pre-acquisition Altera tax years; the outcome of those appeals is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

(Micron) and Intel have jointly developed NAND flash memory and, most recently, 3D XPoint technology products. Intel also purchases jointly developed products directly from Micron under certain supply agreements. The IMFT operating agreement, most recently amended in January 2016, continues through 2024 unless earlier terminated under certain terms and conditions, and provides for certain buy-sell rights of the joint venture. Intel has the right to cause Micron to buy our interest in IMFT. If we exercise this right, Micron would set the closing date of the transaction within two years following such election and could elect to receive financing from us for one to two years. Subsequent to our put right, and commencing in January 2019, Micron has the right to call our interest in IMFT with the closing date to be effective within one year. IMFT is a variable interest entity, and all costs of IMFT are passed on to Micron and Intel through sale of products or services in proportional share of ownership. Our portion of IMFT costs, primarily related to product purchases and production-related services, was approximately $400 million in 2016 (approximately $400 million in 2015 and approximately $400 million in 2014 ). The amount due to IMFT for product purchases and services provided was approximately $95 million as of December 31, 2016 (approximately $20 million as of December 26, 2015 ). IMFT returned $71 million to Intel in 2016 , which is reflected within investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows ( none in 2015 and $6 million in 2014 ). IMFT depends on Micron and Intel for any additional cash needs. Our known maximum exposure to loss approximated the carrying value of our investment balance in IMFT, which was $849 million as of December 31, 2016 . Except for the amount due to IMFT for product purchases and production-related services, we did not have any additional liabilities recognized on our consolidated balance sheets in connection with our interests in this joint venture as of December 31, 2016 . Our potential future losses could be higher than the carrying amount of our investment, as Intel and Micron are liable for other future operating costs or obligations of IMFT. Future cash calls could also increase our investment balance and the related exposure to loss. In addition, because we are currently committed to purchasing 49% of IMFTs production output and production-related services, we may be required to purchase products at a cost in excess of realizable value. We have determined that we do not have the characteristics of a consolidating investor in the variable interest entity and, therefore, we account for our interest in IMFT using the equity method of accounting. Cloudera, Inc. Our investment in Cloudera, Inc. (Cloudera) is accounted for under the equity and cost methods of accounting based on the rights associated with different instruments we own, and is classified within other long-term assets. The carrying value of our equity method investment was $225 million and of our cost method investment was $454 million as of December 31, 2016 ( $256 million for our equity method investment and $454 million for our cost method investment as of December 26, 2015 ). Non-m arke table Cost Method Investments The carrying value of our non-marketable cost method investments was $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2016 ( $2.9 billion as of December 26, 2015 ), of which $454 million and $966 million related to our cost method investments in Cloudera and Beijing UniSpreadtrum Technology Ltd. (UniSpreadtrum), respectively. In 2016 , we recognized impairments of $178 million on non-marketable cost method investments ( $164 million in 2015 and $130 million in 2014 ). Beijing UniSpreadtrum Technology Ltd. During 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. (Tsinghua Unigroup), an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co. Ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop Intel architecture- and communications-based solutions for phones . We agreed to invest up to 9.0 billion Chinese yuan (approximately $1.5 billion as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately 20% of UniSpreadtrum, a holding company under Tsinghua Unigroup. During 2015, we invested $966 million to complete the first phase of the equity investment and accounted for our interest using the cost method of accounting. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Trading Assets Net losses related to trading assets still held at the reporting date were $295 million in 2016 (net losses of $152 million in 2015 and net losses of $530 million in 2014 ). Net gains on the related derivatives were $300 million in 2016 (net gains of $137 million in 2015 and $525 million in 2014 ). Note 10: Acquisitions and Divestitures  Altera Corporation On December 28, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Altera, a global semiconductor company that designs and sells programmable semiconductors and related products. We acquired all outstanding shares of Altera common stock and, subject to certain exceptions, each share of Altera common stock underlying vested stock option awards, RSUs, and performance-based RSU awards in exchange for cash. The acquired company operates as PSG and continues to design and sell programmable logic devices (PLDs), which incorporate field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), and highly integrated System-on-Chip (SoC) devices. This acquisition is expected to expand our reach within the compute continuum, as the combination of our leading-edge products and manufacturing process with Altera's leading FPGA technology enables new classes of platforms that meet customer needs in the data center and Internet of Things market segments. As we develop future platforms, the integration of PLDs into our platform solutions is expected to improve the overall performance and lower the cost of ownership for our customers. For further information, see \" Note 4: Operating Segments and Geographic Information .\" Total consideration to acquire Altera was $14.5 billion (net of $2.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents acquired) and comprised the following: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)   Cash, net of cash acquired  $ 14,401 Share-based awards assumed  Total  $ 14,451 ##TABLE_ENDThe fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major class in the acquisition of Altera were recognized as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)   Short-term investments  $ Receivables  Inventory  Other current assets  Property, plant and equipment  Goodwill  5,448 Identified intangible assets  7,566 Other long-term investments and assets  2,515 Deferred income  (351 ) Other liabilities  (283 ) Long-term debt  (1,535 ) Deferred tax liabilities  (449 ) Total  $ 14,451 ##TABLE_ENDThe goodwill of $5.4 billion arising from the acquisition is attributed to the expected benefit and other benefits that will be generated by combining Intel and Altera. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. For further information on the assignment of goodwill for the acquisition, see  Note 11: Goodwill . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The identified intangible assets assumed in the acquisition of Altera were recognized as follows based upon their fair values as of December 28, 2015: ##TABLE_START   Fair Value (In Millions)  Weighted Average Estimated Useful Life (In Years) Developed technology  $ 5,757  Customer relationships  1,121  Brands   Identified intangible assets subject to amortization  6,965   In-process research and development    Identified intangible assets not subject to amortization    Total identified intangible assets  $ 7,566   ##TABLE_ENDAcquired developed technology represents the fair value of Altera products that have reached technological feasibility and are a part of Alteras product offerings, and in-process research and development represents the fair value of products that have not reached technological feasibility. Customer relationships represent the fair values of the underlying relationships and agreements with Alteras customers. Brands represent the fair value of Altera's master brand and product brand names. Other Acquisitions During 2016 , in addition to the Altera acquisition, we completed 11 acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate consideration (net of cash acquired) of $1.1 billion , most of which was cash . Substantially all of the consideration was allocated to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. During 2015 , we completed eight acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate consideration (net of cash acquired) of $1.0 billion , a substantial majority of which was cash consideration. Substantially all of the consideration was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets, such as acquisition-related developed technology and acquisition-related customer relationships. Included in these acquisitions is our acquisition of Lantiq Semiconductor (Lantiq), intended to extend Intel's success in cable home gateways into DSL and fiber markets. We acquired Lantiq in the second quarter of 2015 for net cash consideration of $345 million , substantially all of which was allocated to goodwill and intangible assets, such as acquisition-related developed technology and acquisition-related customer relationships. The operating results of Lantiq are included in our CCG operating segment. During 2014 , we completed eight acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate consideration of $963 million , substantially all cash consideration. A substantial majority of the consideration was allocated to goodwill and acquisition-related developed technology intangible assets. Included in these acquisitions is our acquisition of the Axxia Networking Business (Axxia business) of Broadcom Limited (formerly Avago Technologies), intended to accelerate growth in the mobile wireless base station business. We acquired the Axxia business in the fourth quarter of 2014 for net cash consideration of $650 million , substantially all of which was allocated to goodwill and acquisition-related developed technology intangible assets. The operating results of the Axxia business are included in our DCG operating segment. Other acquisitions (excluding Altera) completed in 2016, 2015, and 2014, both individually and in the aggregate, were not significant to our results of operations. For information on the assignment of goodwill to our operating segments, see \" Note 11: Goodwill \" and for information on the classification of intangible assets, see \" Note 12: Identified Intangible Assets .\" Actual and Pro Forma Results of Acquirees Net revenue and net income attributable to all acquisitions completed during 2016 have been included in our consolidated statements of income from their respective acquisition dates to the year ended December 31, 2016 . The Altera acquisition was significant to our consolidated results of operations, and these results are reported as PSG in \" Note 4: Operating Segments and Geographic Information .\" INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The unaudited pro forma financial results combine the historical results of Intel and Altera for 2016 and 2015 along with the historical results of other businesses acquired during 2016. The results include the effects of pro forma adjustments as if the businesses acquired in 2016 were acquired at the beginning of Intel's 2015 fiscal year. The pro forma results for the year ended December 26, 2015 include non-recurring adjustments of $387 million for the inventory valuation adjustment, $64 million for deferred income (net of the impact of cost of goods sold) and $94 million for other acquisition-related transaction costs, all of which reduce pro forma net income. The unaudited pro forma financial results presented below do not include any anticipated synergies or other expected benefits of the acquisitions.

(TPG) to transfer certain assets and liabilities relating to ISecG to a newly formed, jointly owned, separate cybersecurity company. The new company will be called McAfee, LLC. (McAfee) following transaction close, which is expected in the second quarter of 2017. Under the terms of the agreement, Intel will transfer certain assets and liabilities relating to ISecG, a transaction valued at approximately $4.2 billion , for consideration of approximately $3.1 billion and a 49% ownership interest in McAfee. Intel will finance approximately $2.2 billion of the consideration until the debt can be refinanced and repaid by McAfee and TPG. TPG will own a 51% ownership interest in McAfee. The carrying amounts of the major classes of ISecG assets and liabilities held for sale included the following: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  Dec 31, 2016 Accounts receivable  $ Goodwill  3,600 Identified intangible assets  Other assets  Total assets held for sale  $ 5,187    Deferred income  $ 1,554 Other liabilities  Total liabilities held for sale  $ 1,920 ##TABLE_ENDIn addition to total assets and liabilities held for sale are currency translation adjustments totaling $507 million . This amount, classified as other comprehensive income, is associated with currency charges on the carrying values of ISecG goodwill and identified intangible assets. Upon transaction close, we will charge this amount against the expected gain. We ceased recording depreciation and amortization on property, plant and equipment and identified intangible assets, respectively, as of the date the assets triggered held for sale accounting.

This reclassification of goodwill is presented within the \"Other\" column in the preceding table. For further information, see \" Note 10: Acquisitions and Divestitures .\" During the first quarter of 2016, we completed the acquisition of Altera and formed PSG. The goodwill recognized from this acquisition was allocated among PSG, DCG, and IOTG based on the relative fair value provided by the acquisition, which reflected the estimated synergistic value generated within DCG and IOTG by incorporating Altera's intellectual property into Intel's future process technology and products. For further information, see \" Note 10: Acquisitions and Divestitures .\" We previously disclosed the goodwill for ISecG and SSG as part of the aggregated software and services operating segments. During the first quarter of 2016, we elected to separately disclose the results of ISecG and determined SSG was no longer an operating segment; accordingly, its goodwill was re-allocated to other operating segments based on the relative fair value. Additionally, we formed NTG, which includes products designed for wearables, cameras, drones, and other market segments. The substantial majority of goodwill under \"all other\" is attributable to NTG, the remainder of which is unallocated from acquisitions completed in 2016. For further information, see \" Note 4: Operating Segments and Geographic Information .\" During the fourth quarters of 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , we completed our annual impairment assessments and we concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years.

For further discussion on our currency interest rate swaps, see \" Note 17: Derivative Financial Instruments .\" ##TABLE_ENDINTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Senior Notes During the second quarter of 2016, we issued a total of $2.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes to refinance existing indebtedness, including our 1.95% senior notes due 2016 and a portion of our 1.35% senior notes due 2017 . During the first quarter of 2016, in connection with our completed acquisition of Altera, we acquired a total of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. During 2015, we issued a total of $9.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes to fund a portion of the cash consideration for our acquisition of Altera. For more information on our Altera acquisition, see \" Note 10: Acquisitions and Divestitures .\" All of our senior notes pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually. We may redeem the notes prior to their maturity at our option at specified redemption prices and subject to certain restrictions. The obligations under the notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and will effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries. Convertible Debentures In 2009 and 2005, we issued junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2039 (2009 debentures) and 2035 (2005 debentures), respectively. Both the 2009 and 2005 debentures pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually. ##TABLE_START   Debentures  Debentures Annual stated coupon interest rate  3.25 %  2.95 % Annual effective interest rate  7.20 %  6.45 % ##TABLE_ENDThe effective interest rate is based on the rate, at inception, for a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature. 2009 Debentures. The 2009 debentures have a contingent interest component that requires us to pay interest based on certain thresholds or for certain events, commencing on August 1, 2019. After such date, if the 10 -day average trading price of $1,000 principal amount of the bond immediately preceding any six -month interest period is less than or equal to $650 or greater than or equal to $1,500 , we are required to pay contingent 0.25% or 0.50% annual interest, respectively. The 2009 debentures are convertible, subject to certain conditions. Holders can surrender the 2009 debentures for conversion if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter. We will settle any conversion of the 2009 debentures in cash up to the face value, and any amount in excess of face value will be settled in cash or stock at our option. On or after August 5, 2019, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2009 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period. In addition, if certain events occur in the future, the indenture governing the 2009 debentures provides that each holder of the debentures can, for a pre-defined period of time, require us to repurchase the holders debentures for the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The 2009 debentures are subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior debt and to the other liabilities of our subsidiaries. We have concluded that the 2009 debentures are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded stock conversion options qualify as derivatives. In addition, we have concluded that the embedded conversion options would be classified in stockholders equity if they were freestanding derivative instruments and are not accounted for separately as derivative liabilities. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) During the fourth quarter of 2016 , the closing stock price conversion right condition of the 2009 debentures continued to be met and the debentures will be convertible at the option of the holders during the first quarter of 2017 . As a result, the $1.1 billion carrying amount of the 2009 debentures was classified as short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 ( $1.1 billion as of December 26, 2015 ). The excess of the amount of cash payable if converted over the carrying amount of the 2009 debentures of $882 million has been classified as temporary equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 ( $897 million as of December 26, 2015 ). In future periods, if the closing stock price conversion right condition is no longer met, all outstanding 2009 debentures would be reclassified to long-term debt and the temporary equity would be reclassified to stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet. 2005 Debentures. The 2005 debentures have a contingent interest component that requires us to pay interest based on certain thresholds or for certain events. If the 10 -day average trading price of $1,000 principal amount of the bond immediately preceding any six -month interest period is less than or equal to $800 or greater than or equal to $1,300 , we are required to pay contingent 0.25% or 0.40% annual interest, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 , we met the upside contingent interest threshold for the six -month interest payment period from December 15, 2016 to June 15, 2017. The 2005 debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock. Holders can surrender the 2005 debentures for conversion at any time. We can settle any conversion of the 2005 debentures in cash or stock at our option. The 2005 debentures become redeemable if the closing price of Intel common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period. During the fourth quarter of 2016 , the closing stock price redemption right condition of the 2005 debentures was met and we have the option to redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2005 debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. We currently do not intend to redeem any of the 2005 debentures. In addition, if certain events occur in the future, the indenture governing the 2005 debentures provides that each holder of the debentures can, for a pre-defined period of time, require us to repurchase the holders debentures for the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The 2005 debentures are subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior debt and to the other liabilities of our subsidiaries. We have concluded that the 2005 debentures are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded stock conversion options qualify as derivatives.

The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees hired prior to January 1, 2011 are eligible for and receive discretionary employer contributions in the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2011 receive discretionary employer contributions in the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan, which are participant-directed. Our CEO determines the annual discretionary employer contribution amounts for the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan and the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan under delegation of authority from our Board of Directors, pursuant to the terms of the plans. Effective January 1, 2015, the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution plan assets and future discretionary employer contributions are participant-directed. For the benefit of eligible U.S. employees, we also provide a non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees. This plan is designed to permit certain discretionary employer contributions and to permit employees to defer a portion of compensation in addition to their Intel 401(k) Savings Plan deferrals. This plan is unfunded. We expensed $326 million for the qualified and non-qualified U.S. retirement contribution plans in 2016 ( $337 million in 2015 and $286 million in 2014 ). In the first quarter of 2017 , we funded $314 million for the 2016 contributions to the qualified U.S. retirement contribution plans. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans U.S. Pension Benefits. For employees hired prior to January 1, 2011, we provide a tax-qualified defined-benefit pension plan, the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan, for eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. Beginning on January 1, 2015, future benefit accruals in the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan were frozen to all employees at or above a specific grade level, and generally covering all highly compensated employees in the plan. Beginning in 2016, the impacted employees received discretionary employer contributions in the Intel 401(k) Savings Plan, instead of the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan. This change was contingent on receiving a favorable private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which we received in October 2014. As a result, our projected benefit obligation was reduced by $1.1 billion in 2014, most of which was also included as a change in actuarial valuation on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan benefit is determined by a participants years of service and final average compensation, as defined by the plan document. The plan generates a minimum pension benefit if the participant's U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan benefit exceeds the annuitized value of the employee's U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan benefit. If participant balances in the U.S. Intel Retirement Contribution Plan do not grow sufficiently, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan could increase significantly. Consistent with applicable law, assets of the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan are held in trust, solely for the benefit of plan participants, and are not available for general corporate purposes. Non-U.S. Pension Benefits. We also provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain other countries, most significantly Ireland, Germany, and Israel. Consistent with the requirements of local law, we deposit funds for certain plans with insurance companies, with third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts, and/or accrue for the unfunded portion of the obligation. U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits. Upon retirement, eligible U.S. employees who were hired prior to January 1, 2014 are credited with a defined dollar amount, based on years of service, into a U.S. Sheltered Employee Retirement Medical Account (SERMA). These credits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase coverage in the retirees choice of medical plan. If the available credits are not sufficient to pay the entire cost of the coverage, the remaining cost is the retirees responsibility. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2014 are not eligible to earn a SERMA benefit. Funding Policy. Our practice is to fund the various pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of applicable local laws and regulations. Additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate. Funding for the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan is discretionary under applicable laws and regulations; additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate. Depending on the design of the plan, local customs, and market circumstances, the liabilities of a plan may exceed qualified plan assets. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets The vested benefit obligation for a defined benefit pension plan is the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee is currently entitled based on the employee's expected date of separation or retirement.

Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the larger of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized on a straight-line basis. The period of amortization is the average remaining service of active participants who are expected to receive benefits under the plans. As of December 31, 2016 , the accumulated benefit obligation was $1.3 billion for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan ( $899 million as of December 26, 2015 ) and $1.7 billion for the non-U.S. defined-benefit pension plans ( $1.6 billion as of December 26, 2015 ).

The U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan, which accounts for 33% of the worldwide pension and postretirement benefit obligations, was 57% funded. Funded status is not indicative of our ability to pay ongoing pension benefits or of our obligation to fund retirement trusts. Required pension funding for U.S. retirement plans is determined in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which sets required minimum contributions. Cumulative company funding to the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan currently exceeds the minimum ERISA funding requirements. Assumptions Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans at the end of each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START   U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits    Dec 31, 2016  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 31, 2016  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 31, 2016  Dec 26, 2015 Discount rate  4.3 %  4.0 %  2.5 %  3.1 %  4.2 %  4.1 % Rate of compensation increase  3.6 %  3.7 %  3.6 %  3.8 %  n/a  n/a ##TABLE_ENDWeighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine costs for the plans for each period were as follows: ##TABLE_START   U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits           Discount rate  3.7 %  3.8 %  4.6 %  3.1 %  2.8 %  4.0 %  3.8 %  3.9 %  4.6 % Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  5.6 %  6.1 %  5.4 %  5.5 %  5.7 %  5.7 %  7.0 %  7.4 %  7.4 % Rate of compensation increase  3.7 %  3.8 %  3.8 %  3.8 %  4.0 %  4.1 %  n/a  n/a  n/a ##TABLE_ENDFor the U.S. plans, we developed the discount rate by calculating the benefit payment streams by year to determine when benefit payments will be due. We then matched the benefit payment streams by year to the AA corporate bond rates to match the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments, and discounted back to the measurement date to determine the appropriate discount rate. For the non-U.S. plans, we used two approaches to develop the discount rate. In certain countries, we used a model consisting of a theoretical bond portfolio for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximated the estimated benefit payments of our pension plans. In other countries, we analyzed current market long-term bond rates and matched the bond maturity with the average duration of the pension liabilities. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) We establish the long-term expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. Net Periodic Benefit Cost In 2016 , the net periodic benefit cost for U.S. pension benefits, non-U.S. pension benefits, and U.S. postretirement medical benefits was $134 million ( $26 million in 2015 and $36 million in 2014 ), $225 million ( $198 million in 2015 and $165 million in 2014 ) and $56 million ( $26 million in 2015 and $17 million in 2014 ), respectively. The increase in the U.S. net periodic pension benefit cost in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily attributed to plan settlement and remeasurement in conjunction with our 2016 Restructuring Program. For more information on the 2016 Restructuring Program, see \" Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges .\" U.S. Pension Plan Assets In general, the investment strategy for U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets is to maximize risk-adjusted returns, taking into consideration the investment horizon and expected volatility to help ensure that sufficient assets are available to pay pension benefits as they come due. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which were 45% for equity investments and 55% for fixed-income investments in 2016 . For 2017 , the expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets is 4.9% . U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following investment categories at the end of each period: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2016  Dec 26, 2015   Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using     (In Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total  Total Equity securities  $  $  $   $  $ Fixed income      Other investments          Assets measured by fair value hierarchy  $  $  $  $  $ Assets measured at net asset value         Cash          Total U.S. pension plan assets at fair value        $  $ ##TABLE_ENDSubstantially all of the fixed income investments in the preceding table are asset-backed securities, corporate debt, and government debt. Government debt includes instruments such as non-U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, and U.S. treasury securities. The assets measured at net asset value are invested in common collective trust funds, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Non-U.S. Plan Assets The investments of the non-U.S. plans are managed by insurance companies, pension funds, or third-party trustees, consistent with regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. The investment manager evaluates performance by comparing the actual rate of return to the return on similar assets. Investments managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under standard contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we have discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equity investments and fixed-income investments, either through index funds or direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market risk and to help ensure that the pension assets are available to pay benefits as they come due. The target allocation of the non-U.S. plan assets that we have control over is 55% equity investments and 45% fixed-income investments. For 2017 , the average expected long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plan assets is 4.3% . Non-U.S. plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following investment categories at the end of each period: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2016  Dec 26, 2015   Fair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using     (In Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total  Total Equity securities  $  $   $  $  $ Fixed income       Assets measured by fair value hierarchy  $  $  $  $  $ Assets measured at net asset value         Cash         Total non-U.S. plan assets at fair value        $  $ 1,011 ##TABLE_ENDMost of the equity investments in the preceding table are invested in a diversified mix of equities of developed countries, including the U.S., and emerging markets throughout the world. We have control over the majority of the assets measured at net asset value, which are invested in hedge funds, bond index, and equity index funds. U.S. Postretirement Medical Plan Assets In general, the investment strategy for U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets, due to the level of expected future benefit payments. The assets are invested solely in a tax-aware global equity portfolio, which is actively managed by an external investment manager. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is composed of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries. For 2017 , the expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets is 6.5% . As of December 31, 2016 , substantially all of the U.S. postretirement medical benefits plan assets were invested in exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. Concentrations of Risk We manage a variety of risks, including credit, liquidity, and market risks, across our plan assets through our investment managers. We define a concentration of risk as an undiversified exposure to one of the aforementioned risks that unnecessarily increases the exposure to a loss of plan assets. We monitor exposure to such risks in both the U.S. and non-U.S. plans by monitoring the magnitude of the risk in each plan and diversifying our exposure to such risks across a variety of counterparties, instruments, and markets. As of December 31, 2016 , we did not have concentrations of risk in any single entity, manager, counterparty, sector, industry, or country. Funding Expectations Under applicable law for the U.S. Intel Minimum Pension Plan, we are not required to make any contributions during 2017 . Our expected required funding for the non-U.S. plans during 2017 is approximately $36 million . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Estimated Future Benefit Payments Estimated benefit payments over the next 10 fiscal years are as follows: ##TABLE_START (In Millions)  U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits  $  $  $ 2018  $  $  $ 2019  $  $  $ 2020  $  $  $ 2021  $  $  $ 2022-2026  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDNote 19: Employee Equity Incentive Plans  Our equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. Under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan), 753 million shares of common stock are authorized for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors through June 2018. As of December 31, 2016 , 216.5 million shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the 2006 Plan. In connection with our completed acquisition of Altera in the first quarter of 2016, we assumed two equity incentive plans with outstanding unvested stock options and RSUs. The assumed stock options and RSUs generally retained the terms and conditions under which they were originally granted. We will not grant additional shares under these assumed plans. We grant RSUs with both a market condition and a service condition (market-based RSUs), referred to in our Proxy Statement as outperformance stock units (OSUs), to a group of senior officers, employees, and non-employee directors. For OSUs granted in 2016 , the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting will range from 0% to 200% of the target amount, based on total stockholder return (TSR) on our common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of a peer group over a three -year period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. As of December 31, 2016 , 6.7 million OSUs were outstanding. These OSUs accrue dividend equivalents and generally vest three years and one month from the grant date. RSU and option awards generally vest over four years from the grant date. Stock options generally expire seven years from the date of grant. The 2006 Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific dates. Under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan, 373 million shares of common stock are authorized for issuance through August 2021. As of December 31, 2016 , 164.8 million shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation recognized in 2016 was $1.4 billion ( $1.3 billion in 2015 and $1.1 billion in 2014 ). The total share-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory as of December 31, 2016 was $44 million ( $49 million as of December 26, 2015 and $39 million as of December 27, 2014 ). During 2016 , the tax benefit that we realized for the tax deduction from share-based awards totaled $616 million ( $533 million in 2015 and $555 million in 2014 ). We estimate the fair value of RSUs with time-based vesting using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our shares of common stock prior to vesting. We estimate the fair value of OSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of rights to acquire shares of common stock granted under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan on the date of the grant. We based the weighted average estimated value of RSU and OSU grants and rights granted under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan on the weighted average assumptions for each period as follows: ##TABLE_START   RSUs and OSUs  Stock Purchase Plan   Dec 31, 2016  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014  Dec 31, 2016  Dec 26, 2015  Dec 27, 2014 Estimated values  $ 29.76  $ 31.63  $ 25.40  $ 6.70  $ 6.56  $ 5.87 Risk-free interest rate  0.9 %  0.6 %  0.5 %  0.5 %  0.1 %  0.1 % Dividend yield  3.3 %  2.9 %  3.3 %  3.2 %  3.1 %  3.2 % Volatility  %  %  %  %  %  % Expected life (in years)  n/a  n/a  n/a  0.5  0.5  0.5 ##TABLE_ENDWe base the expected volatility for rights granted under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan on implied volatility. We base expected volatility for OSUs on historical volatility. Restricted Stock Unit Awards RSU activity in 2016 was as follows: ##TABLE_START   Number of RSUs (In Millions)  Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value December 26, 2015  107.4  $ 26.93 Granted  53.1  $ 29.76 Assumed in acquisition  7.3  $ 33.79 Vested  (50.0 )  $ 26.29 Forfeited  (11.0 )  $ 28.10 December 31, 2016  106.8  $ 28.99 Expected to vest as of December 31, 2016 99.9  $ 28.99 ##TABLE_ENDThe aggregate fair value of awards that vested in 2016 was $1.6 billion ( $1.5 billion in 2015 and $1.1 billion in 2014 ), which represents the market value of our common stock on the date that the RSUs vested. The grant-date fair value of awards that vested in 2016 was $1.3 billion ( $1.1 billion in 2015 and $949 million in 2014 ). The number of RSUs vested includes shares of common stock that we withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. RSUs that are expected to vest are net of estimated future forfeitures. As of December 31, 2016 , unrecognized compensation costs related to RSUs granted under our equity incentive plans were $1.9 billion . We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of 1.2 years . Stock Option Awards As of December 31, 2016 , options outstanding that have vested and are expected to vest were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Number of Options (In Millions)  Weighted Average Exercise Price  Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (In Years)  Aggregate Intrinsic Value (In Millions) Vested  16.6  $ 23.81  2.1  $ Expected to vest  2.9  $ 23.33  3.3  $ Total  19.5  $ 23.74  2.3  $ ##TABLE_ENDAggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price and $36.27 , the closing price of our common stock on December 30, 2016 , as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, for all in-the-money options outstanding. Options outstanding that are expected to vest are net of estimated future option forfeitures. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The aggregate intrinsic value of stock option exercises in 2016 was $453 million ( $284 million in 2015 and $611 million in 2014 ), which represents the difference between the exercise price and the value of our common stock at the time of exercise. During 2016 , 34.1 million options were exercised with a weighted average exercise price of $20.43 . Stock option grants were insignificant in all years during the three-year period ended December 31, 2016 . As of December 31, 2016 , 19.6 million options were outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $23.73 ( 54.2 million outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $21.65 as of December 26, 2015). The weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding options is 2.2 years. These options will expire if they are not exercised by specific dates through May 2023 . Stock Purchase Plan Employees purchased 16.5 million shares of common stock in 2016 for $415 million under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan ( 15.8 million shares of common stock for $421 million in 2015 and 19.4 million shares of common stock for $393 million in 2014 ). As of December 31, 2016 , unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire shares of common stock under our 2006 Stock Purchase Plan totaled  $13 million . We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately two months . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies  Commitments Leases Portions of our capital equipment and certain facilities are under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2058 . Additionally, portions of our real property are under leases that expire at various dates through 2017 . Rental expense was $282 million in 2016 ( $253 million in 2015 and $257 million in 2014 ). Minimum rental commitments under all non-cancelable leases with an initial term in excess of one year were as follows as of December 31, 2016 : ##TABLE_START (In Millions)    $ 2018  2019  2020  2021  2022 and thereafter  Total  $ 1,226 ##TABLE_ENDOther Commitments Commitments for construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment totaled $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2016 ( $5.7 billion as of December 26, 2015 ), a substantial majority of which will be due within the next 12 months. Other purchase obligations and commitments totaled approximately $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2016 (approximately $4.0 billion as of December 26, 2015 ). Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. In addition, we have various contractual commitments with Micron and IMFT. For further information on these contractual commitments, see \" Note 9: Investments .\" During 2012, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) intended to accelerate the development of extreme ultraviolet lithography projects and deep ultraviolet immersion lithography projects, including generic developments applicable to both 300mm and 450mm. Certain of these agreements were amended in 2014. Under the amended agreements, Intel agreed to provide RD funding totaling  829 million  over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from ASML. Our remaining obligation, contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, is approximately 193 million , or $202 million , as of December 31, 2016 . As our obligation is contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, we have excluded this obligation from other purchase obligations and commitments. Legal Proceedings We are a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted in this section. Although management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Government Competition Matters and Consumer Class Actions In 2001, the European Commission (EC) commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy our microprocessors. We received numerous requests for information and documents from the EC and we responded to each of those requests. The EC issued a Statement of Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. In May 2009, the EC issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged \"conditional rebates and payments\" that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged \"payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.\" The EC imposed a fine in the amount of 1.1 billion ( $1.4 billion as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to \"immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in\" the EC decision. The EC decision contained no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision stated that we should \"cease and desist\" from further conduct that, in the EC's opinion, would violate applicable law. We took steps, which are subject to the EC's ongoing review, to comply with that decision pending appeal. We had discussions with the EC to better understand the decision and to explain changes to our business practices. We appealed the EC decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The hearing of our appeal took place in July 2012. In June 2014, the General Court rejected our appeal in its entirety. In August 2014, we filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In November 2014, Intervener Association for Competitive Technologies filed comments in support of Intels grounds of appeal. The EC and interveners filed briefs in November 2014, we filed a reply in February 2015, and the EC filed a rejoinder in April 2015. The Court of Justice held oral argument in June 2016. In October 2016, Advocate General Wahl, an advisor to the Court of Justice, issued a non-binding advisory opinion which favored Intel on a number of grounds, with the 25-judge grand chambers decision expected in the first half of 2017. At least 82 separate class-action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Courts for the Northern District of California, Southern District of California, District of Idaho, District of Nebraska, District of New Mexico, District of Maine, and District of Delaware, as well as in various California, Kansas, and Tennessee state courts. These actions generally repeat the allegations made in a now-settled lawsuit filed against us by AMD in June 2005 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (AMD litigation). Like the AMD litigation, these class-action lawsuits allege that we engaged in various actions in violation of the Sherman Act and other laws by, among other things: providing discounts and rebates to our manufacturer and distributor customers conditioned on exclusive or near-exclusive dealing that allegedly unfairly interfered with AMD's ability to sell its microprocessors; interfering with certain AMD product launches; and interfering with AMD's participation in certain industry standards-setting groups. The class actions allege various consumer injuries, including that consumers in various states have been injured by paying higher prices for computers containing our microprocessors. All of the federal and state class actions other than the California class actions were transferred by the Multidistrict Litigation Panel to the U.S. District Court in Delaware for all pre-trial proceedings and discovery (MDL proceedings). The Delaware district court appointed a Special Master to address issues in the MDL proceedings, as assigned by the court. In July 2010, the Special Master denied the MDL plaintiffs' motion to certify a class of members who purchased certain personal computers containing products sold by us. In July 2014, the district court affirmed the Special Master's ruling and issued an order denying the MDL plaintiffs' motion for class certification. In August 2014, plaintiffs filed a petition for interlocutory appeal of the district court's decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which the Third Circuit denied in October 2014. In December 2014, we filed a motion for summary judgment on the claims of the remaining individual plaintiffs. We subsequently negotiated a settlement of the claims and the case was dismissed in September 2015. All California class actions were consolidated in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County. In March 2008, the plaintiffs in the California actions moved for class certification, which we opposed. In February 2015, the court granted plaintiffs' request for leave to retain a new expert and to amend their previous motion for class certification. In March 2016, the court denied plaintiffs amended class certification motion, and plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration. The parties subsequently agreed to settle the case, and the lawsuit was dismissed in July 2016. INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Shareholder Derivative Litigation regarding In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation In March 2014, the Police Retirement System of St. Louis (PRSSL) filed a shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County against Intel, certain current and former members of our Board of Directors, and a current officer. The complaint alleges that the defendants breached their duties to the company by participating in, or allowing, purported antitrust violations which were alleged in a now-settled antitrust class action lawsuit captioned In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation claiming that Intel, Adobe Systems Incorporated, Apple Inc., Google Inc., Intuit Inc., Lucasfilm Ltd., and Pixar conspired to suppress their employees compensation. In March 2014, a second plaintiff, Barbara Templeton, filed a substantially similar derivative suit in the same court. In May 2014, a third shareholder, Robert Achermann, filed a substantially similar derivative action in the same court. The court consolidated the three actions into one, which is captioned In re Intel Corporation Shareholder Derivative Litigation. Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint in July 2014. In August 2015, the court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint. The plaintiffs thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration and a motion for new trial, both of which the court denied in October 2015. In November 2015, plaintiffs PRSSL and Templeton appealed the court's decision. In June 2015, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) filed a shareholder derivative action in the Chancery Court in Delaware against Intel, certain current and former members of our Board of Directors, and a current officer. The lawsuit makes allegations that are substantially similar to those in the California shareholder derivative litigation described above, but contain additional allegations regarding breach of the duty of disclosure surrounding the In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation and that Intel's 2013 and 2014 proxy statements were false and misleading in that they misrepresented the effectiveness of the Boards oversight of compliance issues at Intel and the Boards compliance with Intels Code of Conduct and Board of Director Guidelines on Significant Corporate Governance Issues. In October 2015, the court stayed the IBEW lawsuit for six months pending further developments in the California case. In March 2016, Intel and IBEW entered into a stipulated dismissal pursuant to which IBEW dismissed its complaint but may re-file upon the withdrawal or final resolution of the appeal in the PRSSL California shareholder derivative litigation. In April 2016, John Esposito filed a shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County against Intel, current members of our Board, and certain former officers and employees. Esposito made a demand on our Board in 2013 to investigate whether our officers or directors should be sued for their participation in the events described in In re High Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation. In November 2015, our Board decided not to take further action on Espositos demand based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee of the Board after its investigation of relevant facts and circumstances. Esposito seeks to set aside such decision, and alleges that the Board was not disinterested in making that decision and that the investigation was inadequate. In August 2016, Intel filed a motion to dismiss Espositos complaint. In November 2016, the court granted Intels motion to dismiss the case, without leave to amend. Esposito may appeal this decision. McAfee, Inc. Shareholder Litigation On August 19, 2010, we announced that we had agreed to acquire all of the common stock of McAfee, Inc. (McAfee) for $48.00 per share. Four McAfee shareholders filed putative class action lawsuits in Santa Clara County, California Superior Court challenging the proposed transaction. The cases were ordered consolidated in September 2010. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that named former McAfee board members, McAfee, and Intel as defendants, and alleged that the McAfee board members breached their fiduciary duties and that McAfee and Intel aided and abetted those breaches of duty. The complaint requested rescission of the merger agreement, such other equitable relief as the court may deem proper, and an award of damages in an unspecified amount. In June 2012, the plaintiffs damages expert asserted that the value of a McAfee share for the purposes of assessing damages should be $62.08 . INTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In January 2012, the court certified the action as a class action, appointed the Central Pension Laborers Fund to act as the class representative, and scheduled trial to begin in January 2013. In March 2012, defendants filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse the class certification order; the petition was denied in June 2012. In March 2012, at defendants request, the court held that plaintiffs were not entitled to a jury trial and ordered a bench trial. In April 2012, plaintiffs filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse that order, which the court of appeal denied in July 2012. In August 2012, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted that motion in November 2012, and entered final judgment in the case in February 2013. In April 2013, plaintiffs appealed the final judgment. Intel, McAfee, and McAfees board of directors filed an opposition to plaintiffs appeal in December 2014. Because the resolution of the appeal may materially impact the scope and nature of the proceeding, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from this matter. We dispute the class-action claims and intend to continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on managements evaluation (with the participation of our CEO and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( 2013 framework ). Managements assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst  Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting, as stated in the firms attestation report, which is included within Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.
