Business . Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Managements Discussion and Analysis (MDA), which appears on pages 31-50; Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which appears on pages 55-57; and Note 11, Segment Information, which appears on pages 71-72 of the 2010 Annual Report. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the Company, PG, we, our or us as used herein refers to The Procter  Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries. The Procter  Gamble Company is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the worlds consumers. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having been built from a business founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. Today, we market our products in more than 180 countries. Throughout this Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Companys annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains these reports at: http://www.sec.gov. You can also access these reports through links from our website at: www.pg.com/investors/sectionmain.shtml. Copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting The Procter  Gamble Company, Shareholder Services Department, P.O. Box 5572, Cincinnati, Ohio 45201-5572. Financial Information about Segments As of June 30, 2010, the Company was organized into three Global Business Units (GBUs): Beauty and Grooming; Health and Well-Being; and Household Care. We had six reportable segments under U.S. GAAP: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Snacks and Pet Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. Many of the factors necessary for an understanding of these businesses are similar. Operating margins of the individual businesses vary slightly due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products, the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. Net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets of each business and products. While none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components within certain of our reportable segments, such as Batteries (Fabric Care and Home Care), Appliances (Grooming) and Prestige Fragrances (Beauty) are seasonal. In addition, anticipation or occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, can drive unusually high demand for batteries. Additional information about our businesses can be found in MDA and Note 11, Segment Information, which appear on pages 31-50 and 71-72, respectively, of the 2010 Annual Report. Narrative Description of Business Business Model . Our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products, as well as the creation of new products. The markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive. Many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier value and low-tier economy products). Generally speaking, we compete with super-premium, premium and mid-tier value products. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries around the world primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores and in high-frequency stores, the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing  markets. We work collaboratively with our customers to improve the in-store presence of our products and win the first moment of truthwhen a consumer is shopping in the store. We must also win the second moment of truthwhen a consumer uses the product, evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and whether it was a good value. We believe we must continue to provide new, innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business. Research and product development activities, designed to enable sustained organic growth, continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year. While many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years, we believe these activities demonstrate our commitment to future growth. Key Product Categories . In 2010, two product categories accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales. The laundry category constituted approximately 17% of net sales for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008. The diaper category constituted approximately 11% of net sales for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 and 10% in 2008. Key Customers . Our customers include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores and high-frequency stores. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 16% of our total revenue in 2010, 2009 and 2008. No other customer represents more than 10% of our net sales. Our top ten customers account for approximately 32% of our total unit volume in 2010, compared to 30% of total unit volume in 2009 and 31% in 2008. The nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government. We believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete. Sources and Availability of Materials . Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from others, some of whom are single-source suppliers. We produce raw materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities used in our plants, products and in the trucks used to deliver our products to customers. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass on the change to our customers, depending on the magnitude and expected duration of the change. The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, no one of which is material to our business taken as a whole. Trademarks and Patents . We own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. All major products and trademarks in each business are registered. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses. Competitive Condition . The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers private-label brands. We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operateoften holding a leadership or significant market share position. We market our products with advertising, promotions and other vehicles to build awareness of our brands in conjunction with an extensive sales force. We believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products. Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important competitive factors. Research and Development Expenditures . Research and development expenditures enable us to develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of our consumers. Total research and development expenses were $1,950 million in 2010, $1,864 million in 2009 and $1,946 million in 2008.  Expenditures for Environmental Compliance . Expenditures for compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not material to the Company. No material change is expected in fiscal year 2011. Employees . Total number of employees is an estimate of total company employees excluding interns, co-ops and employees of joint ventures. Historical numbers include employees of discontinued operations. ##TABLE_START   2010  2009  2008  2007  2006  2005 Total Number of employees  127,000  132,000  135,000  135,000  136,000  107,000 ##TABLE_END Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations Net sales in the United States account for approximately 38% of total net sales. No other individual country had net sales exceeding 10% of total net sales. Operations outside the United States are generally characterized by the same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may also be affected by additional factors including changing currency values, different rates of inflation, economic growth and political and economic uncertainties and disruptions. Our sales by geography for the fiscal years ended June 30 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   2010   2009   2008  North America  42 %  42 %  41 % Western Europe  21 %  21 %  24 % Asia  15 %  14 %  13 % Latin America  9 %  9 %  8 % CEEMEA (1)  13 %  14 %  14 % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) CEEMEA includes Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa ##TABLE_END Net sales and assets in the United States and internationally were as follows (in billions): ##TABLE_START   Net Sales (for the year ended June 30)  Assets (as of June 30)   2010  2009  2008  2010  2009  2008 United States  $ 30.0  $ 29.6  $ 29.7  $ 70.1  $ 71.9  $ 73.8 International  $ 48.9  $ 47.1  $ 49.6  $ 58.1  $ 62.9  $ 70.2 ##TABLE_END Development of the Business The discussion below provides insight to the general development of our business, including the material acquisitions and disposition of assets since the beginning of fiscal 2010. Beauty and Grooming GBU . Effective July 1, 2009, we implemented a number of changes to the organization structure of the Beauty GBU, which resulted in changes to the components of our reportable segment structure. Female blades and razors were formerly included in the Grooming reportable segment and are now included in the Beauty reportable segment. Certain male-focused brands and businesses, such as Old Spice and Gillette personal care, moved from the Beauty reportable segment to the Grooming reportable segment. In addition, the Beauty GBU was renamed the Beauty and Grooming GBU. These changes have been reflected in our segment reporting for all periods presented. Pharmaceuticals Divestiture . On October 30, 2009, we sold our global pharmaceuticals business to Warner Chilcott plc (Warner Chilcott) for $2.8 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Warner Chilcott acquired our portfolio of branded pharmaceuticals products, prescription drug product pipeline and manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and Germany. The pharmaceuticals business had historically been part of  the Health Care reportable segment. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the pharmaceuticals business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from continuing operations and from segment results. ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-K, the Annual Report to Shareholders, quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out of date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. The following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with MDA and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. A material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. This is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. We expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing, higher margin businesses. If demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our results could be negatively impacted. This could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits. In addition, our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations. This means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms, as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our businesses face cost pressures which could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects), sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. In the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements.  We face risks associated with significant international operations. We conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the United States. As a result, we are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues and earnings received and/or balances held by or invested in our foreign subsidiaries, as well as exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the U.S. that can increase our exposure. We have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange controls, including, but not limited to, Venezuela, China and India. Our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these risks in an increasingly volatile environment. Further, we expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. Should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions, our results could be negatively impacted. In addition, economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographical markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. The Companys reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, which could negatively impact sentiments toward the Company, our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer. Our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands, particularly our billion-dollar brands. The success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumers. Further, our results could be negatively impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Our ability to successfully adapt to ongoing organizational change could impact our business results. We have executed a number of significant business and organizational changes including acquisitions, divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies. We expect these types of changes to continue for the foreseeable future. Successfully managing these changes, including retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. In addition, we are generally a build-from-within company, and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes developing organization capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled employees is limited and competition for these resources is intense. Further, business and organizational changes may result in more reliance on third parties for various services, and that reliance may increase compliance risks, including anti-corruption. Finally, our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement. If we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities could impact our business results. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted if: 1) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions, 2) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 3) we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue streams associated with divested brands.  Our business is subject to legislation, regulation and enforcement in the U.S. and abroad. Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations and increased enforcement actions may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in competition, product-related, privacy and environmental laws, including actions in response to global climate change concerns, increased enforcement as well as changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and enforcement penalties. Accordingly, our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and other intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability, including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K, which could require us to take significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period, may materially impact our results. In addition, as a U.S. based multinational company we are also subject to tax regulations in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the U.S. is not taxed in the U.S., provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. If these or other tax regulations should change, our financial results could be impacted. A material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. This includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. Further, there is a continuing trend towards retail trade consolidation, which can create significant cost and margin pressure and could lead to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers. This can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation changes. In addition, our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products. We face risks related to changes in the global economic environment. Our business is impacted by global economic conditions, which are increasingly volatile. If the global economy experiences significant disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted, including such areas as reduced demand for our products from a slow-down in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets and/or temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. A failure of a key information technology system, process or site could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business. We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to interact with internal and external stakeholders. These interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping product to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage the business. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely impact our results of operations and/or financial condition. In addition, we are transitioning our ordering, shipping and billing systems in North America and Western Europe to a new system during fiscal 2011. If the new system does not function properly upon implementation, our ability to process and deliver customer orders in our two largest regions could be limited and could negatively impact our results of operations during the period(s) of transition. Also, we may be unable to process and receive payments for products sold which could negatively impact our cash flow results during those periods.  ", "1B": " Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. ", "2": " Item 2. Properties. In the U.S., we own and operate 37 manufacturing facilities located in 23 different states or territories. In addition, we own and operate 97 manufacturing facilities in 41 other countries. Many of the domestic and international facilities produce products for multiple businesses. Beauty products are manufactured at 39 of these locations; Grooming products at 14; Fabric Care and Home Care products at 51; Baby Care and Family Care products at 30; Snacks and Pet Care products at 11; and Health Care products at 35. Management believes that the Companys production facilities are adequate to support the business efficiently and that the properties and equipment have been well maintained. ", "3": " Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and taxes. The Company is subject to a variety of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe. The Companys policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. The Company is subject to a number of antitrust investigations in Europe. In 2006, French authorities, in connection with an inquiry into potential competition law violations in France, entered the premises of two of the Companys French subsidiaries and seized a variety of documents. In 2008, European Commission officials, with the assistance of the national authorities from a variety of countries, started an investigation into potential competition law violations in a variety of countries across the European Union. Around the same time, the national authorities in Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic initiated additional investigations into potential antitrust concerns within those countries. In connection with these investigations, a number of the Companys subsidiaries were visited and documents seized. Also in 2008, authorities in the United Kingdom (UK) initiated an investigation concerning potential antitrust violations in the UK involving one of the Companys subsidiaries. The Company or its subsidiaries are also involved in other competition law investigations in Germany, Belgium, Romania, Switzerland, France and Greece, as well as some other countries. We believe that all of the above matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. Competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In other industries, fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. In response to the actions of the European Commission and national authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions were taken. During this fiscal year, authorities in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland have issued complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws. The Company has the opportunity to respond to these complaints. The remaining matters discussed above are in various stages of the investigatory process. It is still too early for us to reasonably estimate the total amount of fines to which the Company will be subject as a result of these various competition law issues. However, we have taken and will take reserves as appropriate. Please refer to the Companys Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional information.  In December 2008, the Company became aware of an investigation by Italian authorities into an environmental accident at the site of a contractor which provides services to one or more of the Companys European affiliates. The accident involved the explosion of certain pressurized cans and resulted in the death of one worker and serious injuries to another. Italian authorities have commenced a formal criminal proceeding regarding whether the Companys local affiliate and certain of its employees complied with Italian laws related to the proper classification and disposal of their products. Should they find that these entities violated the law, the Italian authorities could levy fines in excess of $100 thousand against the Companys European affiliate(s).

This plan was approved by the Companys Board of Directors on February 14, 1997. Although the plan has not been submitted to shareholders for approval, it is nearly identical to The Procter  Gamble 1992 Stock Plan, approved by the Companys shareholders on October 13, 1992, except for a few minor changes designed to comply with the Belgian tax laws. The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate key Belgian employees. Under the plan, eligible participants were: (i) granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii) granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii) granted shares of the Companys common stock. Except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights must vest in no less than one year from the date of grant and must expire no later than fifteen years from the date of grant. The exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan is the average price of the Companys stock on the date of grant. If a recipient of a grant leaves the Company while holding an unexercised option or right, any unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, and any exercisable portions become void within one month of departure, except in the case of death or retirement. Any common stock awarded under the plan may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the committee administering the plan may determine. The Procter  Gamble Future Shares Plan On October 14, 1997, the Companys Board of Directors approved The Procter  Gamble Future Shares Plan pursuant to which options to purchase shares of the Companys common stock may be granted to employees worldwide. The purpose of this plan is to advance the interests of the Company by giving substantially all employees a stake in the Companys future growth and success and to strengthen the alignment of interests between employees and the Companys shareholders through increased ownership of shares of the Companys stock. The plan has not been submitted to shareholders for approval. Subject to adjustment for changes in the Companys capitalization, the number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 17 million shares. Under the plans regulations, recipients are granted options to acquire 100 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price equal to the average price of the Companys common stock on the date of the grant. These options vest five years after the date of grant and expire ten years following the date of grant. If a recipient leaves the employ of the Company prior to the vesting date for a reason other than disability, retirement or special separation (as defined in the plan), then the award is forfeited. At the time of the first grant following Board approval of the plan, each employee of the Company not eligible for an award under the 1992 Stock Plan was granted options for 100 shares. From the date of this first grant through June 30, 2003, each new employee of the Company has also received options for 100 shares. Following the grant of options on June 30, 2003, the Company suspended this part of the plan and intends to make no further grants under this part of the plan. The plan terminated on October 13, 2007.  In addition to the grants above, annual grants of options for 100 shares are granted to approximately 3,000 employees who are not eligible for participation in the 2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan in recognition of outstanding performance. The Companys key managers are not eligible for such grants. The Gillette Company 1971 Stock Option Plan No further grants can be made under the plan after April 25, 2005, although unexercised stock options previously granted under this plan remain outstanding. The plan was approved by shareholders of The Gillette Company and assumed by the Company upon the merger between The Procter  Gamble Company and The Gillette Company. All options became immediately vested and exercisable on October 1, 2005 as a result of the merger. After the merger, all outstanding options became options to purchase shares of The Procter  Gamble Company subject to an exchange ratio of .975 shares of PG stock per share of Gillette stock. The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate key salaried employees of The Gillette Company and non-employee members of its Board of Directors. Under the plan, eligible participants receive the option to purchase Company stock at a pre-determined price which cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value per share at the time that the option is granted. The period of any option may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. Subject to adjustment for changes in the Companys capitalization, the number of shares granted under the plan was not to exceed 198,000,000 shares. If a recipient leaves the employ of the Company for any reason other than death or discharge for cause, the recipient is permitted to exercise any vested options granted under the plan for a period between thirty days and five years after termination, depending on the circumstances of his/her departure. If a participant is discharged for cause, all options are immediately cancelled. If a participant dies while holding options, the options are exercisable for a period of one to three years depending on the date of grant. In addition, the plan allows Gillette employees whose employment is terminated for Good Reason within two years after the effective date of the merger the ability to exercise remaining options for the shorter of five years following their termination date or the original life of the grant. Employees terminated for Good Reason who are also eligible to retire under a Company plan are allowed to exercise their options subject to the original terms of the grant. The Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan Shareholders of The Gillette Company approved The Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan on May 20, 2004, and the plan was assumed by the Company upon the merger between The Procter  Gamble Company and The Gillette Company. All options became immediately vested and exercisable on October 1, 2005 as a result of the merger. After the merger, all outstanding options became options to purchase shares of The Procter  Gamble Company subject to an exchange ratio of .975 shares of PG stock per share of Gillette stock. Only employees previously employed by The Gillette Company prior to October 1, 2005 are eligible to receive grants under this plan. The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate employees of The Gillette Company, and until the effective date of the merger between The Gillette Company and The Procter  Gamble Company, non-employee members of the Gillette Board of Directors. Under the plan, eligible participants are: (i) granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii) granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii) granted shares of the Companys common stock or restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents). Subject to adjustment for changes in the Companys capitalization and the addition of any shares authorized but not issued or redeemed under The Gillette Company 1971 Stock Option Plan, the number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 19,000,000 shares. Except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights must expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan must be equal to or greater than the fair market value of the Companys stock on the date of grant. Any common stock awarded under the plan may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the committee administering the plan may determine.  If a recipient of a grant leaves the Company while holding an unexercised option or right: (1) any unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement, special separation (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has waived the termination provisions; and (2) any exercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement, special separation, voluntary resignation that is not for Good Reason (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has waived the termination provisions.

Business . Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Management's Discussion and Analysis (MDA), which appears on pages 33-51; Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which appears on pages 56-58; and Note 11, Segment Information, which appears on pages 71-72 of the 2011 Annual Report. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the \"Company,\" \"PG,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" as used herein refers to The Procter  Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries. The Procter  Gamble Company is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world's consumers. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having been built from a business founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. Today, we market our products in more than 180 countries. Throughout this Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Company's annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains these reports at: http://www.sec.gov. You can also access these reports through links from our website at: www.pg.com/investors/sectionmain.shtml. Copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting The Procter  Gamble Company, Shareholder Services Department, P.O. Box 5572, Cincinnati, Ohio 45201-5572. Financial Information about Segments As of June 30, 2011, the Company was organized into two Global Business Units (GBU's): Beauty and Grooming and Household Care. We had six reportable segments under U.S. GAAP: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Snacks and Pet Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. Many of the factors necessary for an understanding of these businesses are similar. Operating margins of the individual businesses vary due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products, the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. Net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets of each business and products. While none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components within certain of our reportable segments, such as Batteries (Fabric Care and Home Care), Appliances (Grooming) and Prestige Fragrances (Beauty) are seasonal. In addition, anticipation or occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, can drive unusually high demand for batteries. Additional information about our businesses can be found in MDA and Note 11, Segment Information, which appear on pages 33-51 and 71-72, respectively, of the 2011 Annual Report. Narrative Description of Business Business Model . Our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products, as well as the creation of new products. The markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive. Many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier value and low-tier economy products). Generally speaking, we compete with super-premium, premium and mid-tier value products. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries around the world primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores and in \"high-frequency stores,\" the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. We work collaboratively with our customers to improve the in-store presence of our products and win the \"first moment of truth\"-when a consumer is shopping in the store. We must also win the \"second moment of truth\"-when a consumer uses the product, evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and whether it was a good value. We believe we must continue to provide new, innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business. Research and product development activities, designed to enable sustained organic growth, continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year. While many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years, we believe these activities demonstrate our commitment to future growth. Key Product Categories . In 2011, two product categories accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales. The laundry category constituted approximately 16% of net sales for fiscal year 2011 and 17% in 2010 and 2009. The diaper category constituted approximately 11% of net sales for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009.  Key Customers . Our customers include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores and high-frequency stores. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 15% of our total revenue in 2011 and 16% of total revenue in 2010 and 2009. No other customer represents more than 10% of our net sales. Our top ten customers account for approximately 32% of our total unit volume in 2011 and 2010, compared to 30% of total unit volume in in 2009. The nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government. We believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete. Sources and Availability of Materials . Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from others, some of whom are single-source suppliers. We produce raw materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities used in our plants, products and in the trucks used to deliver our products to customers. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass on the change to our customers, depending on the magnitude and expected duration of the change. The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, no one of which is material to our business taken as a whole. Trademarks and Patents . We own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. All major products and trademarks in each business are registered. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses. Competitive Condition . The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate-often holding a leadership or significant market share position. We market our products with advertising, promotions and other vehicles to build awareness of our brands in conjunction with an extensive sales force. We believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products. Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important competitive factors. Research and Development Expenditures . Research and development expenditures enable us to develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of our consumers. Total research and development expenses were $2,001 million in 2011, $1,950 million in 2010 and $1,864 million in 2009.  Expenditures for Environmental Compliance . Expenditures for compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not material to the Company. No material change is expected in fiscal year 2012. Employees . Total number of employees is an estimate of total company employees excluding interns, co-ops and employees of joint ventures. Historical numbers include employees of discontinued operations.  ##TABLE_START       Total Number of employees 129,000  127,000  132,000  135,000  135,000  136,000 ##TABLE_ENDFinancial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations Net sales in the United States account for approximately 37% of total net sales. No other individual country had net sales exceeding 10% of total net sales. Operations outside the United States are generally characterized by the same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may also be affected by additional factors including changing currency values, different rates of inflation, economic growth and political and economic uncertainties and disruptions. Our sales by geography for the fiscal years ended June 30 were as follows:  ##TABLE_START    North America %  %  % Western Europe %  %  % Asia %  %  % Latin America %  %  % CEEMEA (1) %  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  CEEMEA includes Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa ##TABLE_END Net sales and assets in the United States and internationally were as follows (in billions):  ##TABLE_START  Net Sales (for the year ended June 30)  Assets (as of June 30)       United States $30.5  $30.0  $29.6  $70.3  $70.1  $71.9 International $52.1  $48.9  $47.1  $68.1  $58.1  $62.9 ##TABLE_ENDDevelopment of the Business The discussion below provides insight to the general development of our business since the beginning of fiscal year 2011. During fiscal year 2011, we did not have a material acquisition or disposition of assets. Global Business Units. Effective February 2011, PGs business is organized into two product-based segments called Global Business Units (GBUs): Beauty and Grooming and Household Care. These GBUs contain a total of six reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Snacks and Pet Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-K, the Annual Report to Shareholders, quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out of date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. The following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with MDA and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. A material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. This is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. We expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing, higher margin businesses. If demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our results could be negatively impacted. This could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits. In addition, our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations. This means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms, as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our businesses face cost pressures and risks inherent in global manufacturing which could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects), sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. In the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. In addition, we are subject to risks inherent in global manufacturing, such as environmental events, labor disputes, disruption in logistics, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. While we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials, significant disruption of manufacturing could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, have an adverse impact on our business. We face risks associated with significant international operations. We conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the United States. As a result, we are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues and earnings received and/or balances held by or invested in our foreign subsidiaries, as well as exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the U.S. that can increase our exposure. We have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange controls, including, but not limited to, Venezuela, China and India. Our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these risks in an increasingly volatile environment. Further, we expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. Should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions, our results could be negatively impacted. In addition, economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographical markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. The Company's reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, which could negatively impact sentiments toward the Company, our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer. Our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands, particularly our billion-dollar brands. The success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers, or we are unable to maintain trademark protection. Further, our results could be negatively impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Our ability to successfully adapt to ongoing organizational change could impact our business results. We have executed a number of significant business and organizational changes including acquisitions, divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies. We expect these types of changes to continue for the foreseeable future. Successfully managing these changes, including retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. In addition, we are generally a build-from-within company, and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes developing organization capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled employees is limited and competition for these resources is intense. Further, business and organizational changes may result in more reliance on third parties for various services, and that reliance may increase reputational, operational and compliance risks, including the risk of corruption. Finally, our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement. If we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities could impact our business results. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted if: 1) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions, 2) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 3) we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue streams associated with divested brands. Our business is subject to legislation, regulation and enforcement in the U.S. and abroad. Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations and increased enforcement actions may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in competition, product-related, privacy and environmental laws, including actions in response to global climate change concerns, increased enforcement as well as changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and enforcement penalties. Accordingly, our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and other intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability may materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Furthermore, the competition law and antitrust investigations described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K, may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. In addition, as a U.S. based multinational company we are also subject to tax regulations in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the U.S. is not taxed in the U.S., provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. If these or other tax regulations should change, our financial results could be impacted. A material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. This includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. Further, retail trade consolidation could create significant cost and margin pressure and lead to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers. This can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation changes. In addition, our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products. We face risks related to changes in the global economic environment. Our business is impacted by global economic conditions, which are increasingly volatile. If the global economy experiences significant disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to a slow-down in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets, temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers and/or liquidity issues resulting from an inability to access credit markets to obtain cash to support operations. We could also be negatively impacted by an economic crisis in individual countries or regions, including sovereign risk related to a deterioration in the credit worthiness of or a default by local governments. Such events could negatively impact our overall liquidity, as well as our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, and/or create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions. A failure of a key information technology system, process or site could have a material adverse impact on our business. We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, in order to conduct business. These systems include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping product to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, providing data security, and other processes necessary to manage the business. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely impact our results of operations and/or financial condition.

Management believes that the Company's production facilities are adequate to support the business efficiently and that the properties and equipment have been well maintained. ", "3": " Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. As previously reported, the Company has been subject to a number of investigations into potential competition law violations in Europe. Those that remain include investigations by national authorities in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, and Romania. We believe that all of these matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. Although non-monetary sanctions are not being sought in any of these matters, competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. The Company's policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. In response to the actions of the European Commission and national authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions were taken. As a result of certain investigations that were previously disclosed, several authorities issued separate complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in the past. During this fiscal year, the Company received final decisions from the Czech Republic, the European Commission, Italy, Spain and Switzerland, and the United Kingdom decided not to pursue a case against the Company. The ultimate resolution of the remaining matters listed above may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts reserved that could materially impact our income statement and cash flows in the period in which they are accrued and paid, respectively. Please refer to the Company's Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional information. In December 2008, the Company became aware of an investigation by Italian authorities into an environmental accident at the site of a contractor which provides services to one or more of the Company's European affiliates. The accident involved the explosion of certain pressurized cans and resulted in the death of one worker and serious injuries to another. Italian authorities have commenced a formal criminal proceeding regarding whether the Company's local affiliate and certain of its employees complied with Italian laws related to the proper classification and disposal of their products. Should they find that these entities violated the law, the Italian authorities could levy fines in excess of $100 thousand against the Company's European affiliate(s).

(5 ) Weighted average exercise price of outstanding options only. ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble 1992 Stock Plan (Belgian Version) No further grants can be made under the plan, although unexercised stock options previously granted under this plan remain outstanding. This plan was approved by the Company's Board of Directors on February 14, 1997. Although the plan has not been submitted to shareholders for approval, it is nearly identical to The Procter  Gamble 1992 Stock Plan, approved by the Company's shareholders on October 13, 1992, except for a few minor changes designed to comply with the Belgian tax laws. The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate key Belgian employees. Under the plan, eligible participants were: (i) granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii) granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii) granted shares of the Company's common stock. Except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights must vest in no less than one year from the date of grant and must expire no later than fifteen years from the date of grant. The exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan is the average price of the Company's stock on the date of grant. If a recipient of a grant leaves the Company while holding an unexercised option or right, any unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, and any exercisable portions become void within one month of departure, except in the case of death or retirement. Any common stock awarded under the plan may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the committee administering the plan may determine. The Procter  Gamble Future Shares Plan On October 14, 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved The Procter  Gamble Future Shares Plan pursuant to which options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock may be granted to employees worldwide. The purpose of this plan is to advance the interests of the Company by giving substantially all employees a stake in the Company's future growth and success and to strengthen the alignment of interests between employees and the Company's shareholders through increased ownership of shares of the Company's stock. The plan has not been submitted to shareholders for approval. Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company's capitalization, the number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 17 million shares. Under the plan's regulations, recipients are granted options to acquire 100 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price equal to the average price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant. These options vest five years after the date of grant and expire ten years following the date of grant. If a recipient leaves the employ of the Company prior to the vesting date for a reason other than disability, retirement or special separation (as defined in the plan), then the award is forfeited. At the time of the first grant following Board approval of the plan, each employee of the Company not eligible for an award under the 1992 Stock Plan was granted options for 100 shares. From the date of this first grant through June 30, 2003, each new employee of the Company has also received options for 100 shares. Following the grant of options on June 30, 2003, the Company suspended this part of the plan. The plan terminated on October 13, 2007. The Gillette Company 1971 Stock Option Plan No further grants can be made under the plan after April 25, 2005, although unexercised stock options previously granted under this plan remain outstanding. The plan was approved by shareholders of The Gillette Company and assumed by the Company upon the merger between The Procter  Gamble Company and The Gillette Company. All options became immediately vested and exercisable on October 1, 2005 as a result of the merger. After the merger, all outstanding options became options to purchase shares of The Procter  Gamble Company subject to an exchange ratio of .975 shares of PG stock per share of Gillette stock. The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate key salaried employees of The Gillette Company and non-employee members of its Board of Directors. Under the plan, eligible participants receive the option to purchase Company stock at a pre-determined price which cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value per share at the time that the option is granted. The period of any option may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company's capitalization, the number of shares granted under the plan was not to exceed 198,000,000 shares. If a recipient leaves the employ of the Company for any reason other than death or discharge for cause, the recipient is permitted to exercise any vested options granted under the plan for a period between thirty days and five years after termination, depending on the circumstances of his/her departure. If a participant is discharged for cause, all options are immediately cancelled. If a participant dies while holding options, the options are exercisable for a period of one to three years depending on the date of grant. In addition, the plan allows Gillette employees whose employment is terminated for \"Good Reason\" within two years after the effective date of the merger the ability to exercise remaining options for the shorter of five years following their termination date or the original life of the grant. Employees terminated for \"Good Reason\" who are also eligible to retire under a Company plan are allowed to exercise their options subject to the original terms of the grant. The Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan Shareholders of The Gillette Company approved The Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan on May 20, 2004, and the plan was assumed by the Company upon the merger between The Procter  Gamble Company and The Gillette Company. All options became immediately vested and exercisable on October 1, 2005 as a result of the merger. After the merger, all outstanding options became options to purchase shares of The Procter  Gamble Company subject to an exchange ratio of .975 shares of PG stock per share of Gillette stock. Only employees previously employed by The Gillette Company prior to October 1, 2005 are eligible to receive grants under this plan. The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate employees of The Gillette Company, and until the effective date of the merger between The Gillette Company and The Procter  Gamble Company, non-employee members of the Gillette Board of Directors. Under the plan, eligible participants are: (i) granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii) granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii) granted shares of the Company's common stock or restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents). Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company's capitalization and the addition of any shares authorized but not issued or redeemed under The Gillette Company 1971 Stock Option Plan, the number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 19,000,000 shares. Except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights must expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan must be equal to or greater than the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of grant. Any common stock awarded under the plan may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the committee administering the plan may determine.  If a recipient of a grant leaves the Company while holding an unexercised option or right: (1) any unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement, special separation (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has waived the termination provisions; and (2) any exercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement, special separation, voluntary resignation that is not for Good Reason (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has waived the termination provisions.

Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the \"Company,\" \"PG,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" as used herein refer to The Procter  Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries. The Procter  Gamble Company is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world's consumers. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having been built from a business founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. Today, we market our products in more than 180 countries. Throughout this Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Company's annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains these reports at: http://www.sec.gov. You can also access these reports through links from our website at: www.pg.com/investors.

Financial Information about Segments As of June 30, 2012, the Company is organized into two Global Business Units (GBUs): Beauty and Grooming and Household Care. We have five reportable segments under U.S. GAAP: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. Many of the factors necessary for understanding these businesses are similar. Operating margins of the individual businesses vary due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products, the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. Net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets and product categories in which they operate. While none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components within certain reportable segments, such as Batteries (Fabric Care and Home Care), Appliances (Grooming) and Prestige Fragrances (Beauty) are seasonal. In addition, anticipation or occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, can drive unusually high demand for batteries. Additional information about our reportable segments can be found in MDA and Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Information. Narrative Description of Business Business Model . Our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products, as well as the creation of new products. The markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries around the world primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons and in high-frequency stores, the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. We work collaboratively with our customers to improve the in-store presence of our products and win the \"first moment of truth\" - when a consumer is shopping in the store. We must also win the \"second moment of truth\" - when a consumer uses the product, evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and decides whether it was a good value. We believe we must continue to provide new, innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business. Research and product development activities, designed to enable sustained organic growth, continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year. While many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years, we believe these activities demonstrate our commitment to future growth. Key Product Categories . Information on key product categories can be found in Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Information. Key Customers . Our customers include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores and high-frequency stores. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 14%, 15% and 16% of our total revenue in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. No other customer represents more than 10% of our net sales. Our top ten customers account for approximately 31% of our total unit volume in 2012, and 32% of our total unit volume in 2011 and 2010. The nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government. We believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete. Sources and Availability of Materials . Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from others, some of whom are single-source suppliers. We produce raw materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing process and in 3   The Procter  Gamble Company the distribution of input materials and finished product to customers. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers, depending on the magnitude and expected duration of the change. The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, none of which is material to our business taken as a whole. Trademarks and Patents . We own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. All major products and trademarks in each business are registered. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses. Competitive Condition . The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate -often holding a leadership or significant market share position. We support our products with advertising, promotions and other vehicles to build awareness of our brands in conjunction with an extensive sales force. We believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products. Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important competitive factors. Research and Development Expenditures . Research and development expenditures enable us to develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of our consumers.

Risk Factors. The following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with MDA and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. The The Procter  Gamble Company   4  following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. A material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.  We are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. This is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. We expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing, higher margin businesses and by focusing on the most profitable businesses, biggest innovations and most important emerging markets. We expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. If demand for our products and/or market growth rates in either developed or developing markets fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our volume, and consequently our results, could be negatively impacted. This could occur due to, among other things, unforeseen negative economic or political events, changes in consumer trends and habits, or negative consumer responses to pricing actions. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels. The consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, there are ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. This includes, among other things, increasing competition from mid- and lower-tier value products in both developed and developing markets. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms. In addition, the emergence of new sales channels, such as sales made through the Internet directly to consumers, may affect customer and consumer preferences, as well as market dynamics. Failure to effectively compete in these new channels could negatively impact results. Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product and operations innovation and our ability to successfully respond to competitive innovation . Achieving our business results depends, in part, on the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products and improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. Successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance, to obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protections, and to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of others. We must also be able to successfully respond to technological advances by and intellectual property rights granted to competition, and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our results. Our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures which could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, energy costs, pension and healthcare costs, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to forecast and manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects) and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. In addition, our financial projections include cost savings described in our announced productivity plan. Failure to deliver these savings could adversely impact our results. There are risks inherent in global manufacturing which could negatively impact our business results. In the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements, to achieve our targets on cost. While we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials, significant disruption of manufacturing, such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, have an adverse impact on our business. We face risks associated with having significant international operations. We are a global company, with manufacturing operations in more than 40 countries, and a significant portion of our revenue is outside the U.S. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to: ##TABLE_START  compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with a variety of local regulations and laws; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  sudden changes in foreign currency exchange controls; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulties enforcing intellectual property and ##TABLE_END5   The Procter  Gamble Company contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; ##TABLE_START  greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  imposition of more or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and similar restrictions on our sales outside the United States. ##TABLE_END We have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange controls, including, but not limited to, Venezuela, China and India. In addition, some countries where we have businesses, such as Argentina, have introduced import restrictions. Our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment. Fluctuations in exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition. We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States are translated into U.S. dollars. Our operations outside of the U.S. generate a significant portion of our net revenue. Fluctuations in exchange rates may therefore adversely impact our business results or financial condition. See also the Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the MDA and Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We face risks related to changes in the global and political economic environment, including the global capital and credit markets. Our business is impacted by global economic conditions, which have recently been volatile. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries around the world. If the global economy experiences significant disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to a slow-down in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets, temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers and/or liquidity issues resulting from an inability to access credit markets to obtain cash to support operations. Our objective is to maintain credit ratings that provide us with ready access to global capital and credit markets. Any downgrade of our current credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. We could also be negatively impacted by political crises in individual countries or regions, including sovereign risk related to a deterioration in the credit worthiness or a default by local governments. For example, we could be adversely impacted by continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the European Union such as Greece, or the negative impact on economic growth resulting from the combination of federal income tax increases and government spending restrictions potentially occurring at the end of calendar year 2012 in the United States (commonly referred to as the fiscal cliff). Consequently, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographical markets, as well as any political or economic disruption. These risks could negatively impact our overall liquidity and financing and borrowing costs, as well as our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, and/or create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions. If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. The Company's reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, such as customers and suppliers. In addition, many of our brands have worldwide recognition. This recognition is the result of the large investments we have made in our products over many years. The quality and safety of our products is critical to our business. Our Company also devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, efficacy, or similar matters, these issues could negatively impact sentiments toward the Company or our products, our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer. Our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands, and the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering, or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. In addition, given the association of our individual products with the Company, an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products, or the Company as a whole, thereby potentially hurting results. Our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change could impact our business results. We have executed a number of significant business The Procter  Gamble Company   6  and organizational changes including acquisitions, divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies. We expect these types of changes to continue for the foreseeable future. Successfully managing these changes, including retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. Further, ongoing business and organizational changes are likely to result in more reliance on third parties for various services, and that reliance may increase reputational, operational, and compliance risks, including the risk of corruption. We are generally a build-from-within company, and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes developing organization capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled employees is limited and competition for these resources is intense. Finally, our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement. If we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture, and divestiture activities could impact our business results. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted if: 1) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions and joint ventures, 2) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 3) we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with divested brands. Additionally, joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, and/or compliance risks associated with each joint venture we enter into. Our business is subject to changes in legislation, regulation and enforcement, and our ability to manage and resolve pending legal matters in the United States and abroad. Changes in laws, regulations and related interpretations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and increased enforcement actions and penalties may alter the environment in which we do business. As a U.S. based multinational company we are subject to tax regulations in the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the United States is not taxed in the United States, provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. If these or other tax regulations should change, our financial results could be impacted. In addition, our ability to manage regulatory, environmental, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and other intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability may materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Furthermore, if pending legal matters, including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in Item 3 of this Form 10-K and Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies, result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. There are increasing calls in the United States from members of leadership in both major U.S. political parties for comprehensive tax reform which may significantly change the income tax rules that are applicable to U.S. domiciled corporations, such as PG. It is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential legislation would be cumulatively positive or negative for PG's earnings and cash flows. A material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We sell most of our products via retail customers, which consist of mass merchandisers, grocery stores, club stores, drug stores and high-frequency stores. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. This includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. Our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products. Consolidation among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure and lead to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and our key retailers. This would be particularly challenging if major customers are addressing local trade pressures, local law and regulation changes, or financial distress. A failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. We rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems, networks, and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by 7   The Procter  Gamble Company third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. The various uses of these IT systems, networks, and services include, but are not limited to: ##TABLE_START  ordering and managing materials from suppliers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  converting materials to finished products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  shipping product to customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  marketing and selling products to consumers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  processing transactions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  summarizing and reporting results of operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  hosting, processing, and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans, and financial information; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  providing data security; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  handling other processes necessary to manage our business. ##TABLE_END Increased IT security threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of our IT systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. If the IT systems, networks, or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and reputational, competitive and/or business harm, which may adversely impact our results of operations and/or financial condition.

In addition, we own and operate 103 manufacturing facilities in 41 other countries. Many of the domestic and international facilities produce products for multiple businesses. Beauty products are manufactured at 41 of these locations; Grooming products at 16; Fabric Care and Home Care products at 61; Baby Care and Family Care products at 31; and Health Care products at 33. Management believes that the Company's production facilities are adequate to support the business efficiently and that the properties and equipment have been well maintained. ", "3": " Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. As previously reported, the Company has had a number of antitrust cases in Europe. The Company's policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with the relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. In response to the actions of the regulatory authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions were taken. As a result of certain investigations that were previously disclosed, several authorities issued separate complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in the past. The Company resolved several of these matters prior to or during fiscal year 2012. The Company has remaining antitrust matters at various stages of the regulatory process in Belgium, France, Germany and Greece, while other countries have issued decisions, many of which are on appeal. All of these matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. Competition and antitrust violations often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. No non-monetary sanctions are being sought in these matters. For certain of the remaining matters listed above, we have established accruals for potential fines and we do not expect any significant incremental fines or costs in excess of amounts accrued for these matters. For other remaining matters, we cannot reasonably estimate any fines to which the Company may be subject as a result of the investigations.

Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including, without limitation, in the following sections: Management's Discussion and Analysis and Risk Factors. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believe, project, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, strategy, future, opportunity, plan, may, should, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled \"Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks\" and the section titled Risk Factors (Item 1A of this Form 10-K). Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. The following Management's Discussion and Analysis (MDA) is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of PG's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. MDA is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. MDA is organized in the following sections: ##TABLE_START  Overview ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Summary of 2012 Results ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Results of Operations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Segment Results ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Information  ##TABLE_END Throughout MDA, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain specified charges. Free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. We believe these measures provide investors with important information that is useful in understanding our business results and trends. The explanation at the end of MDA provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in MDA are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category and are measured on an annual basis versus the prior 12 month period. References to competitive activity includes promotional and product initiatives from our competitors. OVERVIEW PG is a global leader in retail goods focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons and in high-frequency stores. We continue to expand our presence in other channels, including department stores, perfumeries, pharmacies, salons and e-commerce. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 75 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate - often holding a leadership or significant market share position. 13   The Procter  Gamble Company ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE Our organizational structure is comprised of Global Business Units (GBUs), Global Operations, Global Business Services (GBS) and Corporate Functions (CF). Global Business Units Under U.S. GAAP, the business units comprising the GBUs are aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. The GBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments, businesses and the key product and brand composition within each. ##TABLE_START Reportable Segment % of Net Sales* % of Net Earnings* Categories Billion Dollar Brands Beauty % % Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Cosmetics, Hair Care, Hair Color, Personal Cleansing, Prestige Products, Salon Professional, Skin Care Head  Shoulders, Olay, Pantene, SK-II, Wella Grooming % % Blades and Razors, Electronic Hair Removal Devices, Hair Care Appliances, Pre and Post Shave Products Braun, Fusion, Gillette, Mach3 Health Care % % Feminine Care, Gastrointestinal, Incontinence, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care, Other Personal Health Care, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements Always, Crest, Oral-B, Vicks Fabric Care and Home Care % % Bleach and Laundry Additives, Air Care, Batteries, Dish Care, Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Detergents, Pet Care, Professional, Surface Care Ace, Ariel, Dawn, Downy, Duracell, Febreze, Gain, Iams, Tide Baby Care and Family Care % % Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants, Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper Bounty, Charmin, Pampers ##TABLE_END*  Percent of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2012 (excluding results held in Corporate). Recent Developments: In May 2012, we completed the divestiture of our snacks business to The Kellogg Company. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of our snacks business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and from segment results for all periods presented. As a result of this change, the pet care business is now included in the Fabric Care and Home Care segment. Effective during the quarter ending December 31, 2011, we implemented a number of changes to our organization structure within the Beauty and Grooming Global Business Unit (GBU), which resulted in changes to the components of the Beauty reportable segment and the Grooming reportable segment. We now manage these businesses based on the nature of the product rather than the consumer of the product. As a result, female blades and razors transitioned from Beauty to Grooming, while male personal care products, such as Old Spice and Gillette, moved from Grooming to Beauty. The GBU and segment discussions in MDA and the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been retrospectively revised to reflect the new organizational structure. Beauty: We are a global market leader in the beauty category. Most of the beauty markets in which we compete are highly fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. We compete in beauty, hair care and prestige. In beauty care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to cosmetics to skin care, such as our Olay brand, which is the top facial skin care brand in the world with approximately 10% of the global market share. In hair care, we compete in both the retail and salon professional channels. We are the global market leader in the retail hair care market with over 20% of the global market share behind our Pantene and Head  Shoulders brands. In the prestige channel, we compete primarily with our prestige fragrances and the SK-II brand. We are one of the global market leaders in prestige fragrances, primarily behind our Dolce  Gabbana, Gucci and Hugo Boss fragrance brands. Grooming: We are the global market leader in the blades and razors market and in nearly all of the geographies in which we compete. Our global blades and razors market share is approximately 70%, primarily behind the Gillette franchise including Fusion and Mach3. Our electronic hair removal devices, such as electric razors and epilators, are sold under the Braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. We hold approximately 30% of the male shavers market and over 40% of the female epilators market. The Procter  Gamble Company   14  Health Care: We compete in oral care, feminine care and personal health. In oral care, there are several global competitors in the market, and we have the number two market share position with over 20% of the global market. We are the global market leader in the feminine care category with over 30% of the global market share. In personal health, we are the global market leader in nonprescription heartburn medications behind our Prilosec OTC brand and in respiratory treatments behind our Vicks brand. Certain of our sales outside the U.S in personal health are generated through the PGT Healthcare partnership.  Fabric Care and Home Care: This segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products, including laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; home care products, including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners; batteries; and pet care. In fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader, with over 25% of the global market share, primarily behind our Tide, Ariel and Downy brands. Our global home care market share is over 15% across the categories in which we compete. In batteries, we have over 25% of the global battery market share, behind our Duracell brand. In pet care, we compete in several markets in the premium pet care segment, with the Iams and Eukanuba brands. The vast majority of our pet care business is in North America, where we have approximately a 10% share of the market. Baby Care and Family Care: In baby care, we compete mainly in diapers and baby wipes, with approximately 35% of the global market share. We are the number one or number two baby care competitor in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind Pampers, the Company's largest brand, with annual net sales of approximately $10 billion. Our family care business is predominantly a North American business comprised largely of the Bounty paper towel and Charmin toilet paper brands. U.S. market shares are over 40% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin. Global Operations Global Operations is comprised of our Market Development Organization (MDO), which is responsible for developing go-to-market plans at the local level. The MDO includes dedicated retail customer, trade channel and country-specific teams. It is organized along five geographic units: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa (CEEMEA), Latin America and Asia, which is comprised of Japan, Greater China and ASEAN/Australia/India/Korea (AAIK). Throughout MDA, we reference business results in developing markets, which we define as the aggregate of CEEMEA, Latin America, AAIK and Greater China, and developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan. Global Business Services GBS provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the GBUs and the MDO to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment. Corporate Functions CF provides Company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, external relations, governance, human resources and legal, as well as other centralized functional support. STRATEGIC FOCUS We are focused on strategies that we believe are right for the long-term health of the Company with the objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. The Company's long-term financial targets are: ##TABLE_START  Grow organic sales 1% to 2% faster than the market grows in the categories and geographies in which we compete, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Deliver Core EPS growth of high single digits to low double digits, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Generate free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater. ##TABLE_END In order to achieve these targets, we are prioritizing the strategies and resources that will make PG more focused and fit to win over the near- and long-term. Strengthening our Core Business  We are prioritizing resources on our biggest, most profitable businesses and on the innovations and developing markets that offer the greatest opportunity for growth. ##TABLE_START  Top 40 Businesses: We define our core business as the top 40 country/category combinations, 20 in Household Care and 20 in Beauty  Grooming, which generate the highest level of annual sales and profit. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Top 20 Innovations: Our 20 most important innovations offer significantly higher growth potential than the balance of the innovation portfolio. Therefore, the growth of the Company depends substantially on the success of our biggest innovations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Top 10 Developing Markets: Maintaining the strong growth momentum we have established in developing markets is critical to delivering our near- and long-term growth objectives. We are focusing resources first on the markets that offer the greatest growth opportunity. We will assess the potential for further portfolio expansions beyond the top 10 developing markets based on the top- and bottom-line growth progress of the core business. ##TABLE_END15   The Procter  Gamble Company Improving Productivity and Creating a Cost Savings Culture  We have taken significant steps to accelerate cost savings and create a more cost-focused culture within the Company, including a five-year, $10 billion cost savings initiative, which was announced in February 2012. The cost savings program is based on: ##TABLE_START  Reduction in overhead spending, with a target of approximately 5,700 non-manufacturing overhead positions by the end of fiscal year 2013. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Annual savings planned in cost of goods across raw materials, manufacturing and transportation and warehousing expenses. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Generating efficiencies to enable us to grow marketing costs at a slightly slower rate than sales growth while still increasing consumer reach and effectiveness, saving approximately $1 billion over the five year period. ##TABLE_END Strengthening our Upstream Innovation Program and Pipeline  Innovation has always been - and continues to be - PG's lifeblood. To consistently win with consumers around the world across price tiers and preferences, and to consistently win versus our best competitors, each PG product category must have a full portfolio of innovation. The innovation portfolios must include a mix of commercial programs, incremental product improvements and discontinuous innovations. We have made the creation of more discontinuous innovation a top priority, dedicating RD resources and funding to develop new innovations aimed at changing the game in existing product categories and creating new ones.

The impairment charges included $1.6 billion of before-tax non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges associated with the Appliances and Salon Professional businesses. The incremental restructuring charges totaled $721 million before tax, resulting from the Company's productivity and cost savings plan announced during the year. A 160-basis point decline in gross ##TABLE_ENDmargin was driven primarily by higher commodity costs and negative mix, partially offset by price increases and manufacturing cost savings. ##TABLE_START  Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $1.4 billion due to the gain on the sale of the snacks business. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 19% to $3.12. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted net earnings per share decreased 7% to $3.66, including earnings from discontinued operations of $0.54 per share. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Core EPS decreased 1% to $3.85. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash flow from operating activities was $13.3 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Free cash flow was $9.3 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Free cash flow productivity was 85%. ##TABLE_END ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES AND RISKS We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases The Procter  Gamble Company   16  and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are \"forward-looking statements\" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in this 10-K. Ability to Achieve Business Plans . We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation with respect to both products and operations, on the continued positive reputations of our brands and our ability to successfully maintain trademark protection. This means we must be able to obtain patents and trademarks, and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms and product initiatives. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of ongoing acquisition, divestiture and joint venture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Daily conduct of our business also depends on our ability to maintain key information technology systems, including systems operated by third-party suppliers, and to maintain security over our data. Cost Pressures . Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions, as well as consistent productivity improvements. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in certain countries with currency exchange controls, such as Venezuela, China, and India. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements, and successfully manage any disruptions at Company manufacturing sites. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce optimization. Successfully managing these changes, including identifying, developing and retaining key employees, is critical to our success. Global Economic Conditions . Demand for our products has a correlation to global macroeconomic factors. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic. Economic changes, terrorist activity, political unrest and natural disasters may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, due to terrorist and other hostile activities or natural disasters. We could also be negatively impacted by a global, regional or national economic crisis, including sovereign risk in the event of a deterioration in the credit worthiness of, or a default by local governments, resulting in a disruption of credit markets. Such events could negatively impact our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions and/or negatively impact our overall liquidity. Regulatory Environment . Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and tax laws. Our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, intellectual property, competition law matters and tax policy) and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA), other non-operating items and income taxes. The primary factors driving year over year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives and geographic expansion, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the United States. Most of our cost of products sold and SGA expenses are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focus primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year over year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other 17   The Procter  Gamble Company commodities), pricing impacts, product and geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary drivers of SGA are marketing-related costs and overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we do achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. Overhead costs are also variable in nature, but on a relative basis, less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth. Accordingly, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs. In February 2012, the Company announced a $10 billion productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overhead expenses. The plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the Company's growth strategy. The Company expects to incur approximately $3.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a four-year period as part of this plan. Net Sales Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 Net sales increased 3% to $83.7 billion in 2012 on unit volume that was consistent with the prior year period. Difficult macroeconomic conditions have caused a slowdown in market growth, particularly in developed markets. In addition, we have initiated a number of price increases across each reportable segment, in large part to recover the rising cost of commodities and currency devaluations. These factors have negatively impacted volume growth in 2012, but the price increases have led to higher overall sales. Volume grew low single digits in Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, and Baby Care and Family Care. Fabric Care and Home Care volume decreased low single digits. Volume grew mid-single digits in developing regions and was down low single digits in developed regions. The impact of overall global market growth was partially offset by market share declines in certain categories. Price increases added 4% to net sales, driven by price increases across all business segments and regions, primarily to help offset commodity costs and devaluing currencies in certain developing markets. Mix reduced net sales by 1% due to unfavorable geographic mix across the Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, and Fabric Care and Home Care reportable segments and unfavorable product mix. Foreign exchange was neutral to net sales. Organic sales growth was 3% driven by price increases. Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 Net sales increased 5% in 2011 to $81.1 billion on a 6% increase in unit volume. Volume grew behind market and share growth. Global market growth, in categories that we compete, grew 3% on a constant currency basis. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and double digits in developing regions. All geographic regions contributed to volume growth, led by double-digit growth in Asia, high single-digit growth in Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in CEEMEA and Western Europe. All five of the business segments contributed to volume growth with high single-digit growth in the Baby Care and Family Care and Fabric Care and Home Care segments, mid-single-digit growth in the Beauty and Health Care segments, and a low single-digit growth in the Grooming segment. Organic volume, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, was up 5%. Mix reduced net sales by 2% due mainly to disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier products, both of which have lower than Company average selling prices, and declines in the premium-priced professional salon and prestige categories. Pricing added 1% to net sales behind price increases to offset higher commodity costs and foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was neutral to net sales. Organic sales were up 4%, led by high single-digit growth in the Baby Care and Family Care segment, as well as mid-single-digit growth across the Grooming and Health Care segments. Operating Costs ##TABLE_START Comparisons as a percentage of net sales; Years ended June 30  Basis Point Change   Basis Point Change  Gross margin 49.3 %  (160 )  50.9 %  (140 )  52.3 % Selling, general and administrative expense 31.5 %  (30 )  31.8 %  (20 )  32.0 % Operating margin 15.9 %  (320 )  19.1 %  (120 )  20.3 % Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 15.3 %  (320 )  18.5 %  (70 )  19.2 % Net earnings from continuing operations 11.1 %  (330 )  14.4 %   14.0 % Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble 12.9 %  (170 )  14.6 %  (180 )  16.4 % ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company   18  Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 Gross margin contracted 160 basis points in 2012 to 49.3% of net sales. The reduction in gross margin was driven mainly by a 230-basis point impact from higher commodity and energy costs. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by 200 basis points from negative geographic and product mix and by 30 basis points from the impact of increased restructuring spending due to the productivity and cost savings plan. The negative mix resulted from disproportionate growth in developing regions, as developing regions have lower relative gross margins than developed regions. These impacts were partially offset by a 200-basis point impact from increased pricing and a 140-basis point impact from manufacturing cost savings. Total SGA increased 3% to $26.4 billion in 2012, driven by higher marketing spending to support initiative activity and a $510 million increase in restructuring spending from our productivity and cost savings plan, partially offset by a reduction in competition law fines (see Item 3 of this Form 10-K and Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies), which were $303 million in the prior year compared to $75 million in the current year. SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 31.5%, as reduced competition law fines and the impact of increased scale leverage on marketing and overhead costs from higher sales were partially offset by 60 basis points of incremental restructuring costs. We incurred impairment charges of $1.6 billion ($1.5 billion after tax) in 2012 related to the carrying values of goodwill in our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses and our Koleston Perfect and Wella indefinite lived intangible assets, which are part of our Salon Professional business. See Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details, including factors leading to the impairment charges. Since goodwill is included in Corporate for internal management and segment reporting, the goodwill impairment charges are included in the Corporate segment. The indefinite lived intangible asset impairments are also included in the Corporate segment for management and segment reporting. Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 Gross margin contracted 140 basis points in 2011 to 50.9% of net sales. The reduction in gross margin was driven mainly by a 225-basis point increase in commodity and energy costs, along with negative product mix from disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier products. These impacts were partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and the favorable impact of volume scale leverage. Total SGA increased 4% to $25.8 billion in 2011 behind higher marketing and overhead spending, which was partially offset by the impact of lower foreign currency exchange costs. SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points to 31.8% due to a reduction in overhead and other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by increased marketing investments. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points due to additional marketing investments to support innovation and expansion plans. Overhead spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points due to sales leverage, partially offset by added spending to support growth. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points mainly due to a decrease in Venezuela-related foreign currency exchange costs of $548 million (see further discussion below in \"Venezuela Currency Impacts\"). Charges for competition law fines increased to $303 million versus the prior year charge of $283 million. Non-Operating Items Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 Interest expense decreased 7% in 2012 to $769 million, due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt and a decrease in average debt outstanding. Other non-operating income, net primarily includes divestiture gains, interest and investment income. Other non-operating income decreased $71 million to $262 million in 2012 mainly behind the impact of minor brand divestitures. A divestiture gain from the sale of our PUR water filtration brand in the current year was less than the Zest and Infasil divestiture gains in the prior year. Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 In 2011, interest expense decreased 12% to $831 million due primarily to a reduction in interest rates on floating rate debt partially offset by an increase in debt outstanding. Other non-operating income was a net benefit of $333 million in 2011 versus $82 million in 2010. This $251 million increase was primarily due to the impact of gains on divestitures in 2011 (Zest brand in North America and Infasil brand in Western Europe) and incremental costs in the 2010 associated with exercising the call option on an outstanding bond, partially offset by a gain due to the acquisition of MDVIP in 2010. Income Taxes Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 510 basis points to 27.1% in 2012 primarily due to a 250-basis point impact from the non-deductibility of impairment charges in the current year period and the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions, which drove 250 basis points of the tax rate difference. The net benefit on the current year was $165 million, which netted to 130 basis points, versus 380 basis points of net benefits in the prior year. Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 In 2011, the effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 500 basis points to 22.0%. This was primarily driven by net favorable discrete adjustments (primarily driven by favorable audit and litigation settlements for uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions relating to 19   The Procter  Gamble Company prior periods), which drove 410 basis points of the effective tax rate difference. Net adjustments to tax balances for uncertain tax positions in a number of jurisdictions resulted in a benefit of approximately $535 million in 2011, including a $252 million benefit from the settlement of U.S. tax litigation primarily related to the valuation of technology donations. The 2011 tax rate also benefited from the geographic mix of current year sales and earnings, which drove a 50-basis point reduction as an increased proportion of earnings were generated in foreign markets with lower tax rates versus the United States. Net Earnings Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 Net earnings from continuing operations decreased 20% to $9.3 billion in 2012 as an increase in net sales was more than offset by the impact of impairment charges, incremental restructuring charges and an increase in income taxes. Operating margin declined 320 basis points due primarily to a 190-basis point impact from goodwill and intangible impairment charges in our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses and an 85-basis point impact from incremental restructuring charges. The impact of higher commodity costs and negative product mix were largely offset by higher pricing, manufacturing cost savings and increased scale leverage. Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $1.4 billion in 2012 due to the gain on the divestiture of the snacks business. Diluted net earnings per share decreased 7% from the prior year to $3.66 in fiscal 2012 behind a decrease in net earnings from continuing operations, partially offset by an increase in net earnings from discontinued operations and a reduction in shares outstanding. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations in 2012 decreased 19% to $3.12. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations increased $0.46 due to the gain on the divestiture of the snacks business, partially offset by a decrease in the earnings of the snacks business prior to the divestiture. The reduction in the number of shares outstanding was driven by treasury share repurchases of $4.0 billion, which were made under our publicly announced share repurchase program. Core EPS in 2012 decreased 1% to $3.85. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding current-year impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, current year incremental restructuring charges due to the productivity and cost savings plan, charges in both 2012 and 2011 for European legal matters and a 2011 benefit from the settlement of U.S. tax litigation primarily related to the valuation of technology donations. Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 In 2011, net earnings from continuing operations were $11.7 billion, an increase of 8% versus the prior year due mainly to net sales growth and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by operating margin contraction. Operating margin decreased 120 basis points due to a decrease in gross margin, partially offset by a decrease in SGA spending as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin declined behind higher commodity costs, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings. SGA as a percentage of net sales declined due to reduced foreign currency exchange costs and a reduction in overhead spending as a percentage of net sales due to productivity improvements, partially offset by increased marketing investments. In 2011, net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $1.8 billion mainly due to the impact of the gain on the divestiture of the global pharmaceuticals business in 2010. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations in 2011 increased 11% to $3.85 behind higher net earnings from continuing operations and the reduction in shares outstanding. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations declined $0.56. Diluted net earnings per share declined 4% to $3.93 driven by lower net earnings from discontinued operations, partially offset by higher net earnings from continuing operations and a reduction in weighted average shares outstanding resulting from share repurchase activity. The reduction in the number of shares outstanding was driven by treasury share repurchases of $7.0 billion, nearly all of which were made under our publicly announced share repurchase program. Core EPS increased 7% in 2011 to $3.87. Venezuela Currency Impacts Venezuela was determined to be a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP during fiscal 2010 and as a result, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Venezuela. Currency remeasurement adjustments for non-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by these subsidiaries and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. During fiscal 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued the Bolivar Fuerte relative to the U.S. dollar. The remeasurement of our local balance sheets in fiscal 2010 to the new official exchange rate (4.3 Bolivares Fuertes to the U.S. dollar) did not materially impact our results. This was due to the relatively small non-dollar denominated net monetary asset position in Venezuela. Our overall results in Venezuela are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at the 4.3 rate, which is also expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations. Foreign currency transactions in Venezuela are subject to an official government currency exchange rate. Transactions at the official exchange rate are subject to CADIVI (Venezuela government's Foreign Exchange Administrative Commission). During recent years, in addition to the official exchange rate used for qualifying dividends and imports of goods and services, the Venezuelan government has had a number of currency controls for companies operating in The Procter  Gamble Company   20  Venezuela. Through most of fiscal 2010, payments for certain imported goods and services that did not qualify for the official exchange rate had been satisfied by exchanging Bolivares Fuertes for U.S. dollars through securities transactions in the parallel market rather than at the more favorable official exchange rate. In fiscal 2010, the Venezuelan government enacted regulations that reduced the availability of foreign currency at the official exchange rate. That and an increased spread between the official and parallel exchange rates during most of fiscal 2010 resulted in increased costs for exchange transactions executed using securities transactions in the parallel market during fiscal 2010. The parallel market is now controlled by The Central Bank of Venezuela as the only legal intermediary to execute foreign exchange transactions outside of CADIVI. This is done through the SITME rate, which was approximately 5.3 as of June 30, 2012. The notional amount of transactions that run through this foreign exchange rate for non-essential goods is restrictive, which has essentially eliminated our ability to access any foreign exchange rate other than through the official CADIVI rate to pay for imported goods and/or manage our local monetary asset balances. Finally, the Venezuelan government enacted a price control law during the second half of fiscal 2012 that negatively impacted the net selling prices of certain products sold in Venezuela. This impact was not significant for the fiscal year. As of June 30, 2012, we had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of approximately $1.1 billion. Approximately $338 million of this balance has been remeasured using the SITME parallel rate because we plan to use this amount of the net monetary assets (largely cash) to satisfy U.S. dollar denominated liabilities that do not qualify for official rate dollars. However, as noted in the preceding paragraph, the availability of the parallel market to settle these transactions is uncertain. The remaining net monetary asset balances are currently reflected within our Consolidated Financial Statements at the 4.3 official exchange rate. Depending on the future availability of U.S. dollars at the official rate, our local U.S. dollar needs, our overall repatriation plans and the creditworthiness of the local depository institutions and other creditors, we have exposure for our local monetary assets. We also have devaluation exposure for the differential between the current and potential future official and parallel exchange rates. Our ability to effectively manage sales and profit levels in Venezuela will be impacted by several factors. These include the Company's ability to mitigate the effect of the recently enacted price controls, any potential future devaluation, any further Venezuelan government price or exchange controls, economic conditions and availability of raw materials and utilities. SEGMENT RESULTS Segment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs such as interest expense, investing activities and certain restructuring and asset impairment costs. These costs are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, as described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have investments in certain companies over which we exert significant influence, but do not control the financial and operating decisions and, therefore, do not consolidate these companies for U.S. GAAP purposes (\"unconsolidated entities\"). Given that certain of these investments are managed as integral parts of the Company's business units, they are accounted for as if they were consolidated subsidiaries for management and segment reporting purposes. This means pre-tax earnings in the business units include 100% of each pre-tax income statement component. In determining after-tax earnings in the business units, we eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest, and apply the statutory tax rates. Eliminations to adjust each line item to U.S. GAAP are included in our Corporate segment. All references to net earnings throughout the discussion of segment results refer to net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Procter  Gamble. ##TABLE_START Net Sales Change Drivers vs. Year Ago (2012 vs. 2011) Volume with Acquisitions  Divestitures  Volume Excluding Acquisitions  Divestitures  Foreign Exchange  Price  Mix/Other  Net Sales Growth Beauty %  %  %  %  %  % Grooming %  %  %  %  %  % Health Care %  %  %  %  %  % Fabric Care and Home Care %  %  %  %  %  % Baby Care and Family Care %  %  %  %  %  % TOTAL COMPANY %  %  %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDNet sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. 21   The Procter  Gamble Company BEAUTY ##TABLE_START ($ millions)  Change vs. Prior Year   Change vs. Prior Year Volume n/a  +2 %  n/a  +4 % Net sales $ 20,318  +2 %  $ 19,937  +4 % Net earnings $ 2,390  %  $ 2,542  % ##TABLE_ENDFiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 Beauty net sales increased 2% to $20.3 billion in 2012 on unit volume growth of 2%.

CORPORATE Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical results of certain divested brands and categories; certain asset impairment charges; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate net sales, cost of products sold and SGA for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and noncontrolling interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Since certain unconsolidated entities and less than 100%-owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the related segments, they are accounted for similar to a wholly-owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings in the segments, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests in Corporate. In determining segment net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company's effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest. Corporate net sales primarily reflect the adjustment to eliminate the sales of unconsolidated entities included in business segment results. Accordingly, Corporate net sales are generally negative. Negative net sales in Corporate decreased by $108 million due to adjustments required to eliminate the lower net sales of unconsolidated entities. Net Corporate expenses increased $2.2 billion primarily due to the net after tax goodwill and intangibles impairment charges of $1.5 billion, incremental after-tax restructuring charges of $587 million and the impact of lower net discrete tax adjustments in the current year. Additional discussion of the items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section. 25   The Procter  Gamble Company In 2011, negative net sales in Corporate were down $101 million due to adjustments required to eliminate lower sales of unconsolidated entities. Net income from continuing operations increased $1.3 billion to $498 million. The increase was due to net discrete adjustments to reverse reserves for uncertain tax positions, lower interest expense, a reduction in restructuring-type charges, divestiture gains and prior-period charges for the taxation of certain future retiree prescription drug subsidy payments in the U.S. Additional discussion of the items impacting net income in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section above. Productivity and Cost Savings Plan In February 2012, the Company announced a $10 billion productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The program was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. As part of this plan the Company expects to incur approximately $3.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a four-year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2015). More than half of the costs will be incurred by the end of fiscal 2013 and the remainder in fiscal years 2014 and 2015. Savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the corollary benefits achieved, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. Overall, the costs are expected to deliver approximately $2 billion in before-tax annual savings. The before-tax savings in the current year are not material due to the timing of the plan. Restructuring accruals of $343 million as of June 30, 2012 are classified as current liabilities. Approximately 62% of the restructuring charges incurred during 2012 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges will be funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. Refer to Note 3 in our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the productivity and cost savings plan. CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include acquisitions and share repurchases to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations. Operating Cash Flow Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 Operating cash flow was $13.3 billion in 2012, in line with the prior year. Operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation, asset impairments, deferred income taxes, and gains on sale of businesses), partially offset by working capital increases. Increased accounts receivable used $427 million of cash to fund growth. However, accounts receivable days sales outstanding were down 2 days primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange. Inventory generated $77 million of cash, mainly due to an increase in inventory management improvement efforts, partially offset by inventory to support product initiatives and to build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes. Inventory days on hand declined by 10 days primarily due to inventory management improvement efforts and the impact of foreign exchange. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities used $22 million of cash, due primarily to the payment of fines related to violations of the European competition laws. Cash flow from discontinued operations contributed approximately $200 million to operating cash flow. Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 Operating cash flow was $13.3 billion in 2011, a 17% decrease versus the prior year. Operating cash flow resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and gain on the sale of businesses), partially offset by an increase in working capital. The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable consumed $569 million of operating cash flow in 2011 mainly due to increases in inventories and accounts receivables. Inventory consumed $501 million driven by higher commodity costs, business growth and increased stock levels in advance of initiatives and sourcing changes. Inventory days on hand increased by five days due to the impact of foreign exchange, higher commodity costs and increased safety stock levels. Accounts receivable used $426 million primarily to support business growth. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding were up three days due to timing of sales and the impact of foreign exchange. Inventory and accounts receivable increases were partially offset by accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities, which increased by $358 million to support business growth. Other operating assets and liabilities were also a significant use of operating cash flow due primarily to net reductions in reserves for uncertain tax positions and an increase in the amount of value added taxes due from various governmental authorities. In the prior year, working The Procter  Gamble Company   26  capital was a net source of cash. Free Cash Flow. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends and other discretionary investment. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 Free cash flow was $9.3 billion in 2012, a decrease of 7% versus the prior year. Free cash flow decreased primarily due to higher capital spending to support geographic expansion. Free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings, was 85% in 2012. Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 In 2011, free cash flow was $10.0 billion, a decrease of 23% versus the prior year. Free cash flow decreased due to lower operating cash flow and higher capital spending. Free cash flow productivity was 84% in 2011. Investing Cash Flows Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 Net investing activities consumed $1.1 billion in cash in 2012 mainly due to capital spending, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of $2.9 billion. These proceeds were primarily related to cash received from the sale of our snacks business in 2012. Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 In 2011, net investing activities consumed $3.5 billion of cash due to capital spending and acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales. Capital Spending. We view capital spending efficiency as a critical component of our overall cash management strategy. We manage capital spending to support our business growth plans and have cost controls to deliver our cash generation targets. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $4.0 billion in 2012 and $3.3 billion in 2011. The increase in capital spending resulted primarily from capacity expansions. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points to 4.7% in 2012. Capital spending for our discontinued snacks business was approximately $60 million in 2012. As we continue to support growth, capital spending in total and as a percentage of net sales is expected to increase in fiscal 2013. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 4.1% in 2011. Acquisitions. Acquisitions used $134 million of cash in 2012 primarily for the acquisition of New Chapter, a vitamins supplement business. In 2011, acquisitions used $474 million of cash primarily for the acquisition of Ambi Pur, an air freshener business. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $2.9 billion to cash in 2012 mainly due to the sale of our snacks business. In 2011, proceeds from asset sales contributed $225 million to cash mainly due to the sale of our Infasil brand in Western Europe and Zest brand in North America. Financing Cash Flows Dividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 8% to $2.14 per share in 2012. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $6.1 billion in 2012 and $5.8 billion in 2011. The increase in dividend payments resulted from increases in our quarterly dividends per share, partially offset by a reduction in the number of shares outstanding. In April 2012, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.525 to $0.562 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This represents a 7% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 56th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend in every year since our incorporation in 1890. Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $29.8 billion as of June 30, 2012 and $32.0 billion as of June 30, 2011. Our total debt decreased in 2012 mainly due to bonds reaching maturity and a reduction in commercial paper outstanding, partially offset by debt issuances. Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $4.0 billion in 2012 and $7.0 billion in 2011. Liquidity At June 30, 2012 our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $3.0 billion, largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. On June 30, 2012, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard  Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings are Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard  Poor's), both with a stable outlook. 27   The Procter  Gamble Company We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. These facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in, and in accordance with, the terms of each credit agreement. The current facility is an $11.0 billion facility split between a $7.0 billion 5-year facility and a $4.0 billion 364-day facility, which expire in August 2017 and August 2013, respectively. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain largely undrawn for the foreseeable future. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity.  Contractual Commitments The following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2012. ##TABLE_START ($ millions) Total  Less Than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  After 5 Years RECORDED LIABILITIES          Total debt $ 29,490  $ 8,672  $ 6,927  $ 3,356  $ 10,535 Capital leases     Uncertain tax positions (1)        OTHER          Interest payments relating to long-term debt 8,866   1,546  1,170  5,241 Operating leases (2) 1,817     Minimum pension funding (3) 1,032       Purchase obligations (4) 2,187  1,094    TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS $ 43,470  $ 11,365  $ 10,261  $ 5,148  $ 16,696 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  As of June 30, 2012, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $2.3 billion, including $505 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2012 cannot be made. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the above future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2015 are not currently determinable. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing. Approximately 22% relates to service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include obligations related to the put of our Spanish joint venture discussed further in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (approximately $1 billion) and other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position. ##TABLE_END The Procter  Gamble Company   28  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include income taxes, certain employee benefits and acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized. We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. For additional details on the Company's income taxes, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Employee Benefits We sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits. The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense, since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2012, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets were 7.4% and 9.2%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $90 million. Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a 29   The Procter  Gamble Company discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans of 4.2% and 4.3% respectively, represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100-basis point change in the pension discount rate would impact annual after-tax defined benefit pension expense by approximately $160 million. A change in the OPEB discount rate of 100 basis points would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $70 million. For additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the purchase method, our Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. All of our acquired technology and customer-related intangibles are expected to have determinable useful lives.  The costs of determinable-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. We test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reportable unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reclassified to a determinable life asset and an additional impairment assessment may be performed. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from July 1 to October 1 of each year. This change was made to better align the timing of our annual impairment testing with the timing of the Company's annual strategic planning process. We tested goodwill for impairment as of July 1, 2011 (the testing date under our previous policy) and no impairments were indicated. The results of our impairment testing during the quarter ended December 31, 2011, indicated that the estimated fair values of our Appliances and Salon Professional reporting units were less than their respective carrying amount therefore we recorded a non-cash before and after tax impairment charge of $1.3 billion. Additionally, our impairment testing for indefinite lived intangible assets during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 indicated a decline in the fair value of our Koleston Perfect and Wella trade name intangible assets below their respective carrying values. This resulted in a non-cash before tax impairment charge of $246 million ($173 million The Procter  Gamble Company   30  after tax) to reduce the carrying amounts of these assets to their respective fair values. The Appliances business was acquired as part of the Gillette acquisition and is a stand-alone goodwill reporting unit. The Salon Professional business consists primarily of operations acquired in the Wella acquisition in 2004. These businesses represent some of our more discretionary consumer spending categories. As of June 30, 2012, the Appliances business has remaining goodwill of $586 million, while the Salon Professional business has remaining goodwill of $397 million. As a result of the current year impairments, the estimated fair values of our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses approximate their carrying values. Because purchases in these categories are more discretionary in nature, their operations and underlying fair values were disproportionately impacted by the economic downturn that began in fiscal 2009, which led to a reduction in home and personal grooming appliance purchases and in visits to hair salons. Our valuation of the Appliances and Salon Professional businesses has them returning to sales and earnings growth rates consistent with our long-term business plans. Failure to achieve these business plans or a further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions could result in a valuation that would trigger an additional impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses. For additional details on the timing and results of our goodwill impairment testing, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other than as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, our annual impairment testing for both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets indicated that all other reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset fair values significantly exceeded their respective recorded values. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in additional impairment charges that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year. The recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets from recently impaired businesses and recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and therefore are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge. For example, the Gillette intangible and goodwill amounts represent values as of a relatively more recent acquisition date and, as such, the amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate. Gillette indefinite-lived intangible assets represent approximately 90% of the $26.7 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets at June 30, 2012. Goodwill allocated to stand-alone reporting units consisting primarily of businesses purchased as part of the Gillette acquisition represents 43% of the $53.8 billion of goodwill at June 30, 2012. This includes the Shave Care and Appliance businesses, which are components of the Grooming segment, and the Batteries business, which is part of the Fabric Care and Home Care segment. New Accounting Pronouncements There are no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective that will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, we will be presenting Comprehensive Income in a new format beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, in accordance with new accounting guidance that will eliminate the option of presenting components of other comprehensive earnings as part of the statement of shareholders' equity. For additional details, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. OTHER INFORMATION Hedging and Derivative Financial Instruments As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. Except within financing operations, we leverage the Company's broadly diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments.  Derivative positions can be monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the CorporateManager value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics dataset as of June 30, 2012. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics, a reasonable proxy is included. Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that 31   The Procter  Gamble Company would significantly impact such exposures in the near term. Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments. Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2012, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements. Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with our financing operations, we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months. In addition, we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions. Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2012, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements. Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. In addition to fixed price contracts, we may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures. As of and during the year ended June 30, 2012, we did not have material commodity hedging activity. Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAP Our discussion of financial results includes several \"non-GAAP\" financial measures. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MDA, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. These measures include: Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:  ##TABLE_START Year ended June 30, 2012 Net Sales Growth  Foreign Exchange Impact  Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact*  Organic Sales Growth Beauty %  %  %  % Grooming %  %  %  % Health Care %  %  %  % Fabric Care and Home Care %  %  %  % Baby Care and Family Care %  %  %  % TOTAL PG %  %  %  %         Year ended June 30, 2011 Net Sales Growth  Foreign Exchange Impact  Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact*  Organic Sales Growth Beauty %  %  %  % Grooming %  %  %  % Health Care %  %  %  % Fabric Care and Home Care %  %  %  % Baby Care and Family Care %  %  %  % TOTAL PG %  %  %  % ##TABLE_END* Acquisition/Divestiture Impact includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. Core EPS. This is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. This includes current year impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, current year charges related to incremental restructuring charges due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings, a significant benefit in 2011 from the settlement of U.S. tax litigation primarily related to the valuation of technology donations, charges in 2012, 2011 and 2010 related to pending European legal matters, and a 2010 charge related to a tax provision for retiree healthcare subsidy payments in the U.S. healthcare reform legislation. The Procter  Gamble Company   32  We do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results. We believe the Core EPS measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year earnings per share growth. Core EPS is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The table below provides a reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to Core EPS:  ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   Diluted Net Earnings Per Share - Continuing Operations $ 3.12  $ 3.85  $ 3.47 Impairment Charges 0.51     Incremental Restructuring Charges 0.20     Settlement from U.S. Tax Litigation   (0.08 )   Charges for Pending European Legal Matters 0.03  0.10  0.09 Charge for Taxation of Retiree Healthcare Subsidy     0.05 Rounding (0.01 )     CORE EPS $ 3.85  $ 3.87  $ 3.61 Core EPS Growth (1 )%  %   ##TABLE_ENDNote - All reconciling items are presented net of tax. Tax effects are calculated consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction. The significant adjustment to an income tax reserve was tax expense. There was no tax impact on EPS due to the charges for pending European legal matters. Free Cash Flow. Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Free Cash Flow Productivity. Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. Free cash flow productivity is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity ($ millions):  ##TABLE_START  Operating Cash Flow Capital Spending Free Cash Flow Net Earnings Free Cash Flow Productivity $ 13,284 $ (3,964 ) $ 9,320 $ 10,904 % 13,330 (3,306 ) 10,024 11,927 % 16,131 (3,067 ) 13,064 12,846 % ##TABLE_END", "7A": " Item 7A.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING At The Procter  Gamble Company, we take great pride in our long history of doing what's right. If you analyze what's made our Company successful over the years, you may focus on our brands, our marketing strategies, our organization design and our ability to innovate. But if you really want to get at what drives our Company's success, the place to look is our people. Our people are deeply committed to our Purpose, Values and Principles. It is this commitment to doing what's right that unites us. This commitment to doing what's right is embodied in our financial reporting. High-quality financial reporting is our responsibility-one we execute with integrity, and within both the letter and spirit of the law. High-quality financial reporting is characterized by accuracy, objectivity and transparency. Management is responsible for maintaining an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting to deliver those characteristics in all material respects. The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, provides oversight. We have engaged Deloitte  Touche LLP to audit our Consolidated Financial Statements, on which they have issued an unqualified opinion. Our commitment to providing timely, accurate and understandable information to investors encompasses: Communicating expectations to employees . Every employee-from senior management on down-is required to be trained on the Company's Worldwide Business Conduct Manual , which sets forth the Company's commitment to conduct its business affairs with high ethical standards. Every employee is held personally accountable for compliance and is provided several means of reporting any concerns about violations of the Worldwide Business Conduct Manual , which is available on our website at www.pg.com. Maintaining a strong internal control environment . Our system of internal controls includes written policies and procedures, segregation of duties and the careful selection and development of employees. The system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are executed as authorized and appropriately recorded, that assets are safeguarded and that accounting records are sufficiently reliable to permit the preparation of financial statements conforming in all material respects with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We monitor these internal controls through control self-assessments conducted by business unit management. In addition to performing financial and compliance audits around the world, including unannounced audits, our Global Internal Audit organization provides training and continuously improves internal control processes. Appropriate actions are taken by management to correct any identified control deficiencies. Executing financial stewardship . We maintain specific programs and activities to ensure that employees understand their fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders. This ongoing effort encompasses financial discipline in strategic and daily business decisions and brings particular focus to maintaining accurate financial reporting and effective controls through process improvement, skill development and oversight. Exerting rigorous oversight of the business . We continuously review business results and strategic choices. Our Global Leadership Council is actively involved-from understanding strategies to reviewing key initiatives, financial performance and control assessments. The intent is to ensure we remain objective, identify potential issues, continuously challenge each other and ensure recognition and rewards are appropriately aligned with results. Engaging our Disclosure Committee . We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported timely and accurately. Our Disclosure Committee is a group of senior-level executives responsible for evaluating disclosure implications of significant business activities and events. The Committee reports its findings to the CEO and CFO, providing an effective process to evaluate our external disclosure obligations. Encouraging strong and effective corporate governance from our Board of Directors . We have an active, capable and diligent Board that meets the required standards for independence, and we welcome the Board's oversight. Our Audit Committee comprises independent directors with significant financial knowledge and experience.

Moeller Chief Financial Officer 35   The Procter  Gamble Company MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of The Procter  Gamble Company (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Strong internal controls is an objective that is reinforced through our Worldwide Business Conduct Manual , which sets forth our commitment to conduct business with integrity, and within both the letter and the spirit of the law. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes a Control Self-Assessment Program that is conducted annually for critical financial reporting areas of the Company and is audited by the internal audit function. Management takes the appropriate action to correct any identified control deficiencies. Because of its inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, may not prevent or detect misstatements due to the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden or that misstatements due to error or fraud may occur that are not detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2012, using criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2012, based on these criteria. Deloitte  Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2012, as stated in their report which is included herein. /s/ Robert A. McDonald Robert A. McDonald Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer /s/ Jon R. Moeller Jon R. Moeller Chief Financial Officer August 8, 2012 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Procter  Gamble Company We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2012 and 2011, and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Shareholders' Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2012. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2012 and 2011, and the results of its operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 8, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP Cincinnati, Ohio August 8, 2012 The Procter  Gamble Company   36  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Procter  Gamble Company We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of and for the year ended June 30, 2012 and our report dated August 8, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP Cincinnati, Ohio August 8, 2012 37   The Procter  Gamble Company Consolidated Statements of Earnings ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions except per share amounts; Years ended June 30   NET SALES $ 83,680  $ 81,104  $ 77,567 Cost of products sold 42,391  39,859  37,042 Selling, general and administrative expense 26,421  25,750  24,793 Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges 1,576     OPERATING INCOME 13,292  15,495  15,732 Interest expense   Other non-operating income, net   EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 12,785  14,997  14,868 Income taxes on continuing operations 3,468  3,299  4,017 NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS 9,317  11,698  10,851 NET EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 1,587   1,995 NET EARNINGS 10,904  11,927  12,846 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests   NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER  GAMBLE $ 10,756  $ 11,797  $ 12,736     BASIC NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (1) :      Earnings from continuing operations $ 3.24  $ 4.04  $ 3.63 Earnings from discontinued operations 0.58  0.08  0.69 BASIC NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE 3.82  4.12  4.32 DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (1) :      Earnings from continuing operations 3.12  3.85  3.47 Earnings from discontinued operations 0.54  0.08  0.64 DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE 3.66  3.93  4.11 DIVIDENDS PER COMMON SHARE $ 2.14  $ 1.97  $ 1.80 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Basic net earnings per share and diluted net earnings per share are calculated on net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble. ##TABLE_END See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our products are sold in more than 180 countries primarily through retail operations including mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons and high-frequency stores. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 75 countries. Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated. Use of Estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, consumer and trade promotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, post-employment benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets, uncertain income tax positions and contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although management does not generally believe such differences would materially affect the financial statements in any individual year. However, in regard to ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values, versus those anticipated at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that may materially affect the financial statements in a given year. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned. Revenue transactions represent sales of inventory. The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. The revenue includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to the customer. Our policy is to recognize revenue when title to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period that the revenue is recognized. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred, generally at the time of the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in the accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacture of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product. Cost of products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense (SGA) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items. Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $2,029 in 2012 , $1,982 in 2011 and $1,931 in 2010 . Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include worldwide television, print, radio, internet and in-store advertising expenses and were $9,345 in 2012 , $9,210 in 2011 and $8,475 in 2010 . Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids, all of which are included in SGA, as well as coupons and customer trade funds, which are recorded as reductions to net sales. Other Non-Operating Income, Net Other non-operating income, net, primarily includes net divestiture gains, interest and investment income. Currency Translation Financial statements of operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate those Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company   42  statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). Currency translation adjustments in accumulated OCI were a loss of $357 at June 30, 2012 and a gain of $5,633 at June 30, 2011 . For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Remeasurement adjustments for financial statements in highly inflationary economies and other transactional exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. Cash Flow Presentation The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method, which reconciles net earnings to cash flow from operating activities. The reconciliation adjustments include the removal of timing differences between the occurrence of operating receipts and payments and their recognition in net earnings. The adjustments also remove cash flows arising from investing and financing activities, which are presented separately from operating activities. Cash flows from foreign currency transactions and operations are translated at an average exchange rate for the period. Cash flows from hedging activities are included in the same category as the items being hedged. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as financing activities. Realized gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative instruments used to hedge currency exposures resulting from intercompany financing transactions are also classified as financing activities. Cash flows from other derivative instruments used to manage interest, commodity or other currency exposures are classified as operating activities. Cash payments related to income taxes are classified as operating activities. Cash flows from the Company's discontinued operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash Equivalents Highly liquid investments with remaining stated maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents and recorded at cost. Investments Investment securities consist of readily marketable debt and equity securities. Unrealized gains or losses are charged to earnings for investments classified as trading. Unrealized gains or losses on securities classified as available-for-sale are generally recorded in shareholders' equity. If an available-for-sale security is other than temporarily impaired, the loss is charged to either earnings or shareholders' equity depending on our intent and ability to retain the security until we recover the full cost basis and the extent of the loss attributable to the creditworthiness of the issuer. Investments in certain companies over which we exert significant influence, but do not control the financial and operating decisions, are accounted for as equity method investments. Other investments that are not controlled, and over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method. Both equity and cost method investments are included as other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value. Product-related inventories are primarily maintained on the first-in, first-out method. Minor amounts of product inventories, including certain cosmetics and commodities, are maintained on the last-in, first-out method. The cost of spare part inventories is maintained using the average-cost method. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized over the assets' estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Machinery and equipment includes office furniture and fixtures (15-year life), computer equipment and capitalized software (3- to 5-year lives) and manufacturing equipment (3- to 20-year lives). Buildings are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 40 years. Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, when appropriate, changes are made prospectively. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived brands are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. Our impairment testing of goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. The annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles is based on valuation models that incorporate assumptions and internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans. We believe such assumptions are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. We have acquired brands that have been determined to have indefinite lives due to the nature of our business. We evaluate a number of factors to determine whether an indefinite life is appropriate, including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and indefinite-lived brands may be adjusted to a determinable life. The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology and other intangibles with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives. Customer relationships, brands and other non-contractual Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 43   The Procter  Gamble Company intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over periods generally ranging from 5 to 30 years. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and remaining lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted.  Fair Values of Financial Instruments Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Changes in assumptions or estimation methods could affect the fair value estimates; however, we do not believe any such changes would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, other investments and short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair values of long-term debt and financial instruments are disclosed in Note 5. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies Other than as described below, no new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance that will eliminate the option of presenting components of OCI as part of the statement of shareholders' equity. The guidance will instead require the reporting of OCI in a single continuous statement of comprehensive earnings or in a separate statement immediately following the statement of earnings. The standard is effective for the Company as of July 1, 2012 and will impact our financial statement presentation, but will not impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. NOTE 2 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS The change in the net carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment was as follows: ##TABLE_START  Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Corporate Total Company GOODWILL at JUNE 30, 2010 $ 16,631 $ 21,328 $ 7,859 $ 6,360 $ 1,445 $ $ 54,012 Acquisitions and divestitures (7 ) (7 ) (7 ) (1 ) 104 Translation and other 1,415 1,329 260 6 3,446 GOODWILL at JUNE 30, 2011 18,039 22,650 8,179 6,735 1,553 57,562 Acquisitions and divestitures (3 ) (12 ) 34  (92 ) Goodwill impairment charges (431 ) (899 )     (1,330 ) Translation and other (1,176 ) (1,059 ) (314 ) (212 ) (94 ) (5 ) (2,860 ) GOODWILL at JUNE 30, 2012 16,429 20,680 8,339 6,557 1,459 53,773 ##TABLE_ENDOn May 31, 2012, the Company sold the global snacks business. As a result, the Snacks and Pet Care segment was eliminated. The snacks goodwill prior to the divestiture date is included in the Corporate segment and the pet care goodwill is included in the Fabric Care and Home Care segment for all periods presented. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from July 1 to October 1 of each year. This change was made to better align the timing of our annual impairment testing with the timing of the Company's annual strategic planning process. We believe this change is preferable because it allows us to more efficiently utilize the reporting units' long-term financial projections, which are generated from the annual strategic planning process, as the basis for performing our annual impairment testing. This change did not result in any delay, acceleration or avoidance of impairment, nor did this change result in adjustments to previously issued financial statements. This change was applied prospectively beginning on October 1, 2011; retrospective application to prior periods was impracticable as the Company was unable to objectively determine, without the use of hindsight, the assumptions that would have been used in those earlier periods. We test our indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment during the second fiscal quarter of each year, and accordingly performed this testing during the quarter ended December 31, 2011. We tested goodwill for impairment as of July 1, 2011 (the testing date under our previous policy) and no impairments were indicated. Our goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2011 (the testing date under our new policy) determined that certain goodwill was impaired. Specifically, the results of our impairment testing during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 indicated that the estimated fair values of our Appliances and Salon Professional reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts. The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two-step process. In the first step, we compare the estimated fair Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company   44  value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. The second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination. If the resulting implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. The second step of the goodwill impairment evaluations for the Appliances and Salon Professional reporting units were finalized during the quarter ended March 31, 2012. As a result of our impairment testing, we recorded a non-cash before and after tax impairment charge of $1.3 billion to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to estimated fair value - $899 of the impairment related to Appliances and $431 related to Salon Professional. As of June 30, 2012, the carrying values of the Appliances and Salon Professional goodwill were $586 and $397 , respectively. Our impairment testing for indefinite lived intangible assets during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 also indicated a decline in the fair value of our Koleston Perfect and Wella trade name intangible assets below their respective carrying values. This resulted in a non-cash before tax impairment charge of $246 ( $173 after tax) to reduce the carrying amounts of these assets to their respective fair values. As of June 30, 2012, the carrying values of the Koleston Perfect and Wella trade names were $280 and $554 , respectively. All of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges are included in Corporate for segment reporting. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, we use a discounted cash flow approach, which we believe is the most reliable indicator of fair value of the businesses, and is most consistent with the approach a marketplace participant would use. Under this approach, we estimate the future cash flows of the respective reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and discount those cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of each business. The declines in the fair value of the Appliances and Salon Professional reporting units and the underlying Koleston Perfect and Wella trade name intangibles were driven by a combination of similar competitive and economic factors, which resulted in a reduction in the forecasted growth rates and cash flows used to estimate fair value. These factors include: (1) a more prolonged and deeper deterioration of the macroeconomic environment than was previously expected which, due to the more discretionary nature of the Appliances and Salon Professional businesses, led to a reduction in the overall market size in the short term and a more significant and prolonged reduction in the expected underlying market growth rates and resulting sales levels in the longer term. This is particularly evident in Europe, which is where we have historically generated a majority of the Appliances and Salon Professional sales; (2) increasing competitive levels of innovation in Salon Professional negatively impacting our current and nearer-term projected market share progress; and, (3) an increasing level of competitive pricing activities negatively impacting pricing levels and lowering overall category profitability. As a result of these factors, we reduced our current and longer-term sales and earnings forecasts for these businesses. The goodwill and intangible asset valuations are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those used in our valuations. To the extent such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows used to estimate fair value, we may need to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future. In addition to the impairment charge discussed above, goodwill also decreased from June 30, 2011 primarily as a result of currency translation across all reportable segments, partially offset by the establishment of goodwill related to the business combination with Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. in our Health Care reportable segment.  Identifiable intangible assets were comprised of: ##TABLE_START  2011 June 30 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DETERMINABLE LIVES Brands $ 3,297 $ 1,687 $ 3,392 $ 1,553 Patents and technology 3,164 2,021 3,195 1,840 Customer relationships 2,048 2,121 Other 218 217 TOTAL 8,861 4,568 9,043 4,212      INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES Brands $ 26,695 $  $ 27,789 $  TOTAL 35,556 4,568 36,832 4,212 ##TABLE_ENDThe amortization of intangible assets was as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   Intangible asset amortization $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 45   The Procter  Gamble Company Estimated amortization expense over the next five fiscal years is as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30 2014 2016 Estimated amortization expense $ $ $ $ $ ##TABLE_ENDSuch estimates do not reflect the impact of future foreign exchange rate changes.

Before tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually. In February 2012, the Company announced a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The program was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the Company's growth strategy. The Company expects to incur approximately $3.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a four year period, including costs incurred as part of this plan and the ongoing plan. The Company expects to incur more than half of the costs under this plan by the end of fiscal 2013, with the remainder incurred in fiscal years 2014 and 2015. The restructuring activities will be executed across the Company's centralized organization as well as across virtually all of its MDO and GBU organizations. These restructuring activities include a plan for a net reduction in non-manufacturing overhead personnel of approximately 5,700 by the end of fiscal 2013. This is being done via the elimination of duplicate work, simplification through the use of technology, and the optimization of the various functional organizations, the number of business units and of the Company's global footprint. In addition, the plan includes integration of newly acquired companies, optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Costs incurred under the plan will consist primarily of costs to separate employees and asset-related costs to exit facilities. The Company will also incur other types of costs outlined below as a direct result of the plan. For the year ended June 30, 2012, the Company incurred charges of $ 1.1 billion . Approximately $746 of these charges were recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. The remainder is included in cost of products sold. The following table presents accrued restructuring activity for the year ended June 30, 2012: ##TABLE_START  Separations  Asset Related Costs  Other  Total Reserve Balance June 30, 2011 $  $   $  $ Charges    1,052 Cash Spent (300 )    (182 )  (482 ) Charges against Assets   (378 )    (378 ) Reserve Balance June 30, 2012     ##TABLE_ENDSeparation Costs Employee separation charges for the year ended June 30, 2012 relate to severance packages for approximately 3,300 employees, of which 1,600 will exit the Company after June 30, 2012. These severance packages include approximately 2,250 related to non-manufacturing overhead personnel, occurring primarily in North America and Western Europe. The packages are predominantly voluntary and the amounts are calculated based on salary levels and past years of service. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Asset-Related Costs Asset-related costs consist of both asset write downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal. These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company   46  Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These shortened-lived assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardization. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. The majority of asset-related charges for the year ended June 30, 2012 are related to the decision to relocate operations from the Company's offices in Kobe, Japan. Other Costs Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the productivity and cost savings plan. Such charges primarily include employee relocation related to separations and office consolidations, termination of contracts related to supply chain redesign and the cost to change internal systems and processes to support the underlying organizational changes. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges will be funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting. Accordingly, 100% of the charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment. However, for informative purposes, the following table summarizes the total restructuring costs related to our reportable segments. ##TABLE_START  Year Ended June 30, 2012 Beauty $ Grooming Health Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Corporate (1) Total Company 1,052 ##TABLE_END(1) Corporate includes costs related to allocated overheads, including charges related to our MDO, GBS and Corporate Functions activities.

We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. To the extent we choose to manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions that we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. At inception, we formally designate and document qualifying instruments as hedges of underlying exposures. We formally assess, at inception and at least quarterly, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. Fluctuations in the value of these instruments generally are offset by changes in the value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. This offset is driven by the high degree of effectiveness between the exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument. The ineffective portion of a change in the fair value of a qualifying instrument is immediately recognized in earnings. The amount of ineffectiveness recognized is immaterial for all years presented. Credit Risk Management We have counterparty credit guidelines and normally enter into transactions with investment grade financial institutions. Counterparty exposures are monitored daily and downgrades in counterparty credit ratings are reviewed on a timely basis. We have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, material credit losses on our risk management or other financial instruments. Certain of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position as of June 30, 2012 , was $52 . The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features. Interest Rate Risk Management Our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. To manage this risk in a cost-efficient manner, we enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to exchange with the counterparty, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional amount. Interest rate swaps that meet specific accounting criteria are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in interest expense. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument is reported in OCI and reclassified into interest expense over the life of the underlying debt obligation. The ineffective portion for both cash flow and fair value hedges, which is not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in earnings. Foreign Currency Risk Management We manufacture and sell our products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world. As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To manage the exchange rate risk primarily associated with our financing operations, we have historically used a combination of forward contracts, options and currency swaps. As of June 30, 2012 , we had currency swaps with maturities up to five years, which are intended to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion, which is not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in earnings. The change in fair values of certain non-qualifying instruments used to manage foreign exchange exposure of intercompany financing transactions and certain balance sheet items subject to revaluation are immediately recognized in earnings, substantially offsetting the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposures. Net Investment Hedging We hedge certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries. To accomplish this, we either borrow directly in foreign currencies and designate all or a portion of the foreign currency debt as a hedge of the applicable net investment position or enter into foreign currency swaps that are designated as hedges of net investments. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in OCI to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. Currency effects of these hedges reflected in OCI were an after-tax gain of $740 and an after-tax loss of $1,176 in 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Accumulated net balances were after-tax losses of $3,706 and $4,446 as of June 30, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company   48  Commodity Risk Management Certain raw materials used in our products or production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. To manage the volatility related to anticipated purchases of certain of these materials, we may, on a limited basis, use futures and options with maturities generally less than one year and swap contracts with maturities up to five years. These market instruments generally are designated as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the changes in fair value for these instruments is reported in OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective and non-qualifying portions, which are not material for any year presented, are immediately recognized in earnings. As of and during the year ended June 30, 2012, we did not have material commodity hedging activity. Insurance We self-insure for most insurable risks. However, we purchase insurance for Directors and Officers Liability and certain other coverage in situations where it is required by law, by contract or deemed to be in the best interest of the Company. Fair Value Hierarchy Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:  Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets. When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets or liabilities during the year. Our fair value estimates take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and our counterparties. When active market quotes are not available for financial assets and liabilities, we use industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including credit risk, interest rate curves, foreign currency rate and forward and spot prices for currencies. In circumstances where market- based observable inputs are not available, management judgment is used to develop assumptions to estimate fair value. Generally, the fair value of our Level 3 instruments is estimated as the net present value of expected future cash flows based on external inputs. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 49   The Procter  Gamble Company The following table sets forth the Company's financial assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2012 and 2011 that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total As of June 30        ASSETS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE                Investment securities $  $  $   $   $  $  $  $ Derivatives relating to:                Foreign currency hedges              Other foreign currency instruments (1)            Interest rates            Net investment hedges              Commodities            TOTAL ASSETS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE (2)                 LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE                Derivatives relating to:                Foreign currency hedges $   $   $  $  $   $   $  $ Other foreign currency instruments (1)            Net investment hedges            Commodities            TOTAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE (3)            LIABILITIES NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE                Long-term debt (4) 25,829  24,940  2,119  1,486      27,948  26,426 TOTAL LIABILITIES RECORDED AND NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE 25,829  24,940  2,305  1,787      28,134  26,727 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Other foreign currency instruments are comprised of foreign currency financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Investment securities are presented in other noncurrent assets and all derivative assets are presented in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other noncurrent assets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  All liabilities are presented in accrued and other liabilities or other noncurrent liabilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Long-term debt includes the current portion ( $4,095 and $3,008 as of June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively) of debt instruments. Long-term debt is not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. ##TABLE_END The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the years presented. In addition, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 financial assets and liabilities during the years presented. The Company re-measured operating real estate assets to estimated fair value of $ 8 during the year ended June 30, 2012, using comparable prices for similar assets, resulting in a $ 220 impairment. Except for this and the goodwill and intangible assets discussed in Note 2, there were no additional significant assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years presented.  Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.

Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated to give effect to stock options and other stock-based awards (see Note 7) and assume conversion of preferred stock (see Note 8). Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble and common shares used to calculate basic and diluted net earnings per share were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS $ 9,317  $ 11,698  $ 10,851 Net earnings from discontinued operations 1,587   1,995 NET EARNINGS 10,904  11,927  12,846 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (148 )  (130 )  (110 ) NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER  GAMBLE (Diluted) 10,756  11,797  12,736 Preferred dividends, net of tax benefit (256 )  (233 )  (219 ) NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER  GAMBLE AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS (Basic) 10,500  11,564  12,517       NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER  GAMBLE AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS (Basic) $ 8,913  $ 11,335  $ 10,522       NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER  GAMBLE (Diluted) $ 9,169  $ 11,568  $ 10,741       Shares in millions; Years ended June 30   Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,751.3  2,804.0  2,900.8 Effect of dilutive securities      Conversion of preferred shares (1) 123.9  128.5  134.0 Exercise of stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 66.0  69.4  64.5 DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING 2,941.2  3,001.9  3,099.3 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Despite being included currently in diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs pursuant to the repayment of the ESOPs' obligations through 2035. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Approximately 67 million in 2012 , 93 million in 2011 and 101 million in 2010 of the Company's outstanding stock options were not included in the diluted net earnings per share calculation because the options were out of the money or to do so would have been antidilutive (i.e., the total proceeds upon exercise would have exceeded the market value of the underlying common shares). ##TABLE_END NOTE 7 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION We have stock-based compensation plans under which we annually grant stock option, restricted stock, restricted stock unit (RSU) and performance stock unit (PSU) awards to key managers and directors. Exercise prices on options granted have been, and continue to be, set equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of the grant. Since September 2002, the key manager stock option awards granted are vested after three years and have a 10 -year life. The key manager stock option awards granted from July 1998 through August 2002 vested after three years and have a 15 -year life. Key managers can elect to receive up to 50% of the value of their option award in RSUs. Key manager RSUs vest and are settled in shares of common stock five years from the grant date. The awards provided to the Company's directors are in the form of restricted stock and RSUs. In addition to our key manager and director grants, we make other minor stock option and RSU grants to employees for which the terms are not substantially different. In 2011, we implemented a performance stock program (PSP) and granted PSUs to senior level executives. Under this program, the number of PSUs that will vest three years after the respective grant date is based on the Company's performance relative to pre-established performance goals during that three year period. A total of 180 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under stock-based compensation plans approved by shareholders in 2003 and 2009. A total of 87 million shares remain available for grant under the 2003 and 2009 plans. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company   52  Total stock-based compensation expense for stock option grants was $317 , $358 and $417 for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Total compensation cost for restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs was $60 , $56 and $36 in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for stock options, restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs was $102 , $117 and $118 in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. In calculating the compensation expense for stock options granted, we utilize a binomial lattice-based valuation model. Assumptions utilized in the model, which are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and experience, were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   Interest rate 0.2-2.1%  0.3-3.7%  0.3-4.0% Weighted average interest rate 1.9 %  3.4 %  3.7 % Dividend yield 2.6 %  2.4 %  2.2 % Expected volatility 12-18%  14-18%  15-20% Weighted average volatility %  %  % Expected life in years 8.5  8.8  8.8 ##TABLE_ENDLattice-based option valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs and those ranges are disclosed in the preceding table. Expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatilities of call options on our stock. We use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination patterns within the valuation model. The expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. A summary of options outstanding under the plans as of June 30, 2012 , and activity during the year then ended is presented below: ##TABLE_START Options in thousands Options Weighted Avg.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $820 , $628 and $342 in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The total grant-date fair value of options that vested during 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $435 , $445 and $563 , respectively. We have no specific policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options; however, we have historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash availability, market trends and other factors, to satisfy stock option exercise activity. At June 30, 2012 , there was $297 of compensation cost that has not yet been recognized related to stock option grants. That cost is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 1.8 years. At June 30, 2012 , there was $125 of compensation cost that has not yet been recognized related to restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 3.1 years. Cash received from options exercised was $1,735 , $1,237 and $703 in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises totaled $239 , $188 and $89 in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. NOTE 8 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN We offer various postretirement benefits to our employees. Defined Contribution Retirement Plans We have defined contribution plans which cover the majority of our U.S. employees, as well as employees in certain other countries. These plans are fully funded. We generally make contributions to participants' accounts based on individual base salaries and years of service. Total global defined contribution expense was $353 , $347 and $344 in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The primary U.S. defined contribution plan (the U.S. DC plan) comprises the majority of the expense for the Company's defined contribution plans. For the U.S. DC plan, the contribution rate is set annually. Total contributions for this plan approximated 15% of total participants' annual wages and salaries in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 . We maintain The Procter  Gamble Profit Sharing Trust (Trust) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) to provide a portion of the funding for the U.S. DC plan and other retiree benefits (described below). Operating details of the ESOP are provided at the end of this Note. The fair value of the ESOP Series A shares allocated to participants reduces our cash contribution required to fund the U.S. DC plan. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 53   The Procter  Gamble Company Defined Benefit Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits We offer defined benefit retirement pension plans to certain employees. These benefits relate primarily to local plans outside the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, plans assumed in previous acquisitions covering U.S. employees. We also provide certain other retiree benefits, primarily health care and life insurance, for the majority of our U.S. employees who become eligible for these benefits when they meet minimum age and service requirements. Generally, the health care plans require cost sharing with retirees and pay a stated percentage of expenses, reduced by deductibles and other coverages. These benefits are primarily funded by ESOP Series B shares and certain other assets contributed by the Company. Obligation and Funded Status . The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of these defined benefit plans: ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits (1)  Other Retiree Benefits (2) Years ended June 30    CHANGE IN BENEFIT OBLIGATION        Benefit obligation at beginning of year (3) $ 12,229  $ 11,245  $ 4,886  $ 4,778 Service cost    Interest cost    Participants' contributions    Amendments (44 )     Actuarial loss/(gain) 1,911  (633 )   (235 ) Acquisitions/(divestitures) (17 )       Special termination benefits      Currency translation and other (847 )  1,137  (95 )  Benefit payments (559 )  (492 )  (255 )  (239 ) BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT END OF YEAR (3) 13,573  12,229  6,006  4,886 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits (1)  Other Retiree Benefits (2)     CHANGE IN PLAN ASSETS        Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 7,962  $ 6,562  $ 2,975  $ 2,843 Actual return on plan assets   (126 )  Employer contributions    Participants' contributions    Currency translation and other (395 )     ESOP debt impacts (4)      Benefit payments (559 )  (492 )  (255 )  (239 ) FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AT END OF YEAR 7,974  7,962  2,713  2,975 FUNDED STATUS (5,599 )  (4,267 )  (3,293 )  (1,911 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Primarily non-U.S.-based defined benefit retirement plans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Primarily U.S.-based other postretirement benefit plans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  For the pension benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation.

We determine our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis. These assumptions are weighted to reflect each country that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits. The weighted average assumptions for the defined benefit and other retiree benefit calculations, as well as assumed health care trend rates, were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits Years ended June 30    ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS (1)        Discount rate 4.2 %  5.3 %  4.3 %  5.7 % Rate of compensation increase 3.3 %  3.5 %   %   % ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST (2)        Discount rate 5.3 %  5.0 %  5.7 %  5.4 % Expected return on plan assets 7.4 %  7.0 %  9.2 %  9.2 % Rate of compensation increase 3.5 %  3.5 %   %   % ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES        Health care cost trend rates assumed for next year     8.0 %  8.5 % Rate to which the health care cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend rate)     5.0 %  5.0 % Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate      ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Determined as of end of year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Determined as of beginning of year and adjusted for acquisitions. ##TABLE_END Several factors are considered in developing the estimate for the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets. For the defined benefit retirement plans, these factors include historical rates of return of broad equity and bond indices and projected long-term rates of return obtained from pension investment consultants. The expected long-term rates of return for plan assets are 8 - 9% for equities and 5 - 6% for bonds. For other retiree benefit plans, the expected long-term rate of return reflects the fact that the assets are comprised primarily of Company stock. The expected rate of return on Company stock is based on the long-term projected return of 9.5% and reflects the historical pattern of favorable returns. Assumed health care cost trend rates could have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other retiree benefit plans. A one- percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: ##TABLE_START  One-Percentage Point Increase  One-Percentage Point Decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost components $  $ (59 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation  (724 ) ##TABLE_ENDPlan Assets . Our target asset allocation for the year ended June 30, 2012 , and actual asset allocation by asset category as of June 30, 2012 and 2011 , were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Target Asset Allocation  Actual Asset Allocation at June 30      Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits Asset Category Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits     Cash %  %  %  %  %  % Debt securities %  %  %  %  %  % Equity securities %  %  %  %  %  % TOTAL %  %  %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company   56  The following tables set forth the fair value of the Company's plan assets as of June 30, 2012 and 2011 segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy (refer to Note 5 for further discussion on the fair value hierarchy and fair value principles). Common collective funds are valued using the net asset value reported by the managers of the funds and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. Company stock listed as Level 2 in the hierarchy represents preferred shares which are valued based on the value of Company common stock. Insurance contracts represent the majority of our Level 3 pension instruments and are based on their cash equivalent or models that project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate curves.  ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total         ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE:                Cash and cash equivalents $  $  $   $   $   $   $  $ Government bonds            Company stock              Common collective fund - equity     3,727  3,612      3,727  3,612 Common collective fund - fixed income     4,112  4,027      4,112  4,027 Other            TOTAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE   7,839  7,639    7,974  7,962 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Retiree Benefits  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total         ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE:                Cash and cash equivalents $  $  $   $   $   $   $  $ Company stock     2,418  2,655      2,418  2,655 Common collective fund - equity            Common collective fund - fixed income            Other            TOTAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE   2,695  2,928    2,713  2,975 ##TABLE_ENDThere was no significant activity within the Level 3 pension and other retiree benefits plan assets during the years presented. Our investment objective for defined benefit retirement plan assets is to meet the plans' benefit obligations, while minimizing the potential for future required Company plan contributions. The investment strategies focus on asset class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit payments and an appropriate balance of long-term investment return and risk. Target ranges for asset allocations are determined by matching the actuarial projections of the plans' future liabilities and benefit payments with expected long-term rates of return on the assets, taking into account investment return volatility and correlations across asset classes. Plan assets are diversified across several investment managers and are generally invested in liquid funds that are selected to track broad market equity and bond indices. Investment risk is carefully controlled with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and continual monitoring of investment managers' performance relative to the investment guidelines established with each investment manager. Cash Flows . Management's best estimate of cash requirements for the defined benefit retirement plans and other retiree benefit plans for the year ending June 30, 2013, is approximately $452 and $25 , respectively. For the defined benefit retirement plans, this is comprised of $144 in expected benefit payments from the Company directly to participants of unfunded plans and $308 of expected contributions to funded plans. For other retiree benefit plans, this is comprised of expected contributions that will be used directly for benefit payments. Expected contributions are dependent on many variables, including the variability of the market value of the plan assets as compared to the benefit obligation and other market or regulatory conditions. In addition, we take into consideration our business investment opportunities and resulting cash requirements. Accordingly, actual funding may differ significantly from current estimates. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 57   The Procter  Gamble Company Total benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which include payments funded from the Company's assets, as discussed above, as well as payments from the plans, are as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ending June 30 Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS $  $ 2014  2015  2016  2017  2018 - 2022 3,133  1,614 ##TABLE_END Employee Stock Ownership Plan We maintain the ESOP to provide funding for certain employee benefits discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The ESOP borrowed $1.0 billion in 1989 and the proceeds were used to purchase Series A ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the U.S. DC plan. Principal and interest requirements of the borrowing were paid by the Trust from dividends on the preferred shares and from advances provided by the Company. The original borrowing of $1.0 billion has been repaid in full, and advances from the Company of $127 remain outstanding at June 30, 2012 . Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock. The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $2.14 per share. The liquidation value is $6.82 per share. In 1991, the ESOP borrowed an additional $1.0 billion . The proceeds were used to purchase Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of retiree health care benefits. These shares, net of the ESOP's debt, are considered plan assets of the other retiree benefits plan discussed above. Debt service requirements are funded by preferred stock dividends, cash contributions and advances provided by the Company, of which $473 is outstanding at June 30, 2012 . Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock. The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $2.14 per share. The liquidation value is $12.96 per share. Our ESOP accounting practices are consistent with current ESOP accounting guidance, including the permissible continuation of certain provisions from prior accounting guidance. ESOP debt, which is guaranteed by the Company, is recorded as debt (see Note 4) with an offset to the reserve for ESOP debt retirement, which is presented within shareholders' equity. Advances to the ESOP by the Company are recorded as an increase in the reserve for ESOP debt retirement. Interest incurred on the ESOP debt is recorded as interest expense. Dividends on all preferred shares, net of related tax benefits, are charged to retained earnings. The series A and B preferred shares of the ESOP are allocated to employees based on debt service requirements, net of advances made by the Company to the Trust. The number of preferred shares outstanding at June 30 was as follows: ##TABLE_START Shares in thousands   Allocated 50,668  52,281  54,542 Unallocated 11,348  13,006  14,762 TOTAL SERIES A 62,016  65,287  69,304     Allocated 20,802  20,759  20,752 Unallocated 38,743  40,090  41,347 TOTAL SERIES B 59,545  60,849  62,099 ##TABLE_ENDFor purposes of calculating diluted net earnings per common share, the preferred shares held by the ESOP are considered converted from inception. NOTE 9 INCOME TAXES Income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current year and for the impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which represent future tax consequences of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using the enacted statutory tax rates and are adjusted for any changes in such rates in the period of change.

In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was signed into law. One of the provisions of the PPACA changed the taxability of federal subsidies received by plan sponsors that provide retiree prescription drug benefits at least equivalent to Medicare Part D coverage. As a result of the change in taxability of the federal subsidy, we were required to make adjustments to deferred tax asset balances, resulting in a $152 charge to income tax expense in 2010. Tax benefits credited to shareholders' equity totaled $661 and $510 for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. These primarily relate to the tax effects of net investment hedges, excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and the impacts of certain adjustments to pension and other retiree benefit obligations recorded in shareholders' equity. We have undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $39 billion at June 30, 2012 , for which deferred taxes have not been provided. Such earnings are considered indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiaries. If such earnings were repatriated, additional tax expense may result, although the calculation of such additional taxes is not practicable. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for uncertain tax positions is as follows: ##TABLE_START    BEGINNING OF YEAR $ 1,848  $ 1,797  $ 2,003 Increases in tax positions for prior years   Decreases in tax positions for prior years (188 )  (388 )  (146 ) Increases in tax positions for current year   Settlements with taxing authorities (49 )  (168 )  (216 ) Lapse in statute of limitations (81 )  (94 )  (45 ) Currency translation (101 )   (120 ) END OF YEAR 1,773  1,848  1,797 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company is present in over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40-50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statute of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. The Company is making a concerted effort to bring its audit inventory to a more current position. We have done this by working with tax authorities to conduct audits for several open years at once. We have tax years open ranging from 2002 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit. While we do not expect material changes, it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to our uncertain tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months related to the audits described above. At this time, we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of uncertain tax positions or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items. Included in the total liability for uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2012 , is $1.4 billion that, depending on the ultimate resolution, could impact the effective tax rate in future periods. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of June 30, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , we had accrued interest of $439 , $475 and $622 and penalties of $66 , $80 and $89 , respectively, that are not included in the above table. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , we recognized $(2) , $(197) and $38 in interest expense/(benefit) and $(10) , $(16) and $(8) in penalties expense/(benefit), respectively. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 59   The Procter  Gamble Company Deferred income tax assets and liabilities were comprised of the following: ##TABLE_START June 30  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS    Pension and postretirement benefits $ 2,366  $ 1,406 Stock-based compensation 1,304  1,284 Loss and other carryforwards  Goodwill and other intangible assets  Accrued marketing and promotion  Fixed assets  Unrealized loss on financial and foreign exchange transactions  Accrued interest and taxes  Inventory  Other  Valuation allowances (375 )  (293 ) TOTAL 5,839  5,581    DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES    Goodwill and other intangible assets $ 11,816  $ 12,206 Fixed assets 1,719  1,742 Other  TOTAL 13,821  14,159 ##TABLE_ENDNet operating loss carryforwards were $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion at June 30, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. If unused, $1.2 billion will expire between 2013 and 2032. The remainder, totaling $1.6 billion at June 30, 2012 , may be carried forward indefinitely. NOTE 10 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Guarantees In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may provide routine indemnifications (e.g., indemnification for representations and warranties and retention of previously existing environmental, tax and employee liabilities) for which terms range in duration and, in some circumstances, are not explicitly defined. The maximum obligation under some indemnifications is also not explicitly stated and, as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss on any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In certain situations, we guarantee loans for suppliers and customers. The total amount of guarantees issued under such arrangements is not material. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that have a material impact on our financial statements. Purchase Commitments and Operating Leases We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations are as follows:  ##TABLE_START June 30 2014 2016 Thereafter Purchase obligations $ 1,094 $ $ $ $ $ ##TABLE_ENDSuch amounts represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing. Approximately 22% of our purchase commitments relate to service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced to third-party suppliers. Due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination. We do not expect to incur penalty payments under these provisions that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our partner in a joint venture that holds a portion of our business in Spain has informed us of their intent to exercise their rights to put their interest in the joint venture to us. The put price is based on a formula tied to the venture's earnings and approximates fair value. Upon closing of the transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals, we would account for the transaction as a purchase, whereby we would record the entire underlying business at fair value and recognize a holding gain for the portion of the venture currently held by us. The purchase price for the partner's interest would be approximately $1 billion based on current exchange rates, and the resulting holding gain on our current interest in the venture would be approximately $400 to $600 . We also lease certain property and equipment for varying periods. Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases, net of guaranteed sublease income, are as follows:  ##TABLE_START June 30 2014 2016 Thereafter Operating leases $ $ $ $ $ $ ##TABLE_ENDLitigation We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters such as antitrust, trade and other governmental regulations, product liability, patent and trademark matters, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, labor and employments matters and income and other taxes. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company   60  As previously disclosed, the Company has had a number of antitrust matters in Europe. These matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. The Company's policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the Company is doing. Competition and antitrust law inquiries often continue for several years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. In response to the actions of the regulatory authorities, the Company launched its own internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws. The Company identified violations in certain European countries and appropriate actions were taken. Several regulatory authorities in Europe have issued separate decisions pursuant to their investigations alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in those countries. The Company has accrued the assessed fines for each of the decisions, of which all but $ 15 has been paid as of June 30, 2012. Most of those are on appeal. As a result of our initial and on-going analyses of other formal complaints, the Company has accrued liabilities for competition law violations totaling $ 18 as of June 30, 2012. While the ultimate resolution of these matters for which we have accrued liabilities may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts reserved, we do not expect any such incremental losses to materially impact our financial statements in the period in which they are accrued and paid, respectively. The remaining authorities' investigations are in various stages of the regulatory process. For these other remaining competition law matters, we cannot reasonably estimate any additional fines to which the Company may be subject as a result of the investigations. We will continue to monitor developments for all of these investigations and will record additional charges as appropriate. With respect to other litigation and claims, while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. NOTE 11 SEGMENT INFORMATION Effective during the quarter ended December 31, 2011, we implemented a number of changes to our organization structure for the Beauty  Grooming Global Business Unit (GBU), which resulted in changes to the components of the Beauty reportable segment and the Grooming reportable segment. As a result of these changes, female blades and razors transitioned from the Beauty segment to the Grooming segment, while male personal care products such as Old Spice and Gillette, moved from the Grooming segment to the Beauty segment. In May 2012, we completed the divestiture of the snacks business to The Kellogg Company. As a result of this transaction, the snacks business, which was previously included in the Snacks and Pet Care segment, is reported as discontinued operations. Additionally, as a result of this change, the pet care business is now included in the Fabric Care and Home Care segment. The segment information provided below reflects these changes for all periods presented. The Company has two GBUs: the Beauty  Grooming GBU and the Household Care GBU. Under U.S. GAAP, we have five reportable segments: ##TABLE_START  Beauty : Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Cosmetics, Hair Care, Hair Color, Personal Cleansing, Prestige Products, Salon Professional and Skin Care; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Grooming : Blades and Razors, Electronic Hair Removal Devices, Hair Care Appliances and Pre- and Post-Shave Products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Health Care : Feminine Care, Gastrointestinal, Incontinence, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care, Other Personal Health Care and Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fabric Care and Home Care : Bleach and Laundry Additives, Air Care, Batteries, Dish Care, Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Detergents, Pet Care, Professional and Surface Care; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Baby Care and Family Care : Baby Wipes, Diapers, Paper Towels, Tissues and Toilet Paper. ##TABLE_END The accounting policies of the businesses are generally the same as those described in Note 1. Differences between these policies and U.S. GAAP primarily reflect income taxes, which are reflected in the businesses using applicable blended statutory rates, and the treatment of certain unconsolidated investees. Certain unconsolidated investees are managed as integral parts of our business units for management reporting purposes. Accordingly, these partially owned operations are reflected as consolidated subsidiaries in segment results, with full recognition of the individual income statement line items through before-tax earnings. Eliminations to adjust these line items to U.S. GAAP are Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 61   The Procter  Gamble Company included in Corporate. In determining after-tax earnings for the businesses, we eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest and apply statutory tax rates. Adjustments to arrive at our effective tax rate are also included in Corporate. Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities that are not reflected in the operating results used internally to measure and evaluate the businesses, as well as eliminations to adjust management reporting principles to U.S. GAAP. Operating activities in Corporate include the results of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level along with the elimination of individual revenues and expenses generated by certain unconsolidated investees, discussed in the preceding paragraph, over which we exert significant influence, but do not control. Operating elements also include certain employee benefit costs, the costs of certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce rationalization, and other general Corporate items. The non-operating elements in Corporate primarily include interest expense, divestiture gains and interest and investing income. In addition, Corporate includes the historical results of certain divested businesses. Total assets for the reportable segments include those assets managed by the reportable segment, primarily inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets. Other assets, primarily including cash, accounts receivable, investment securities and goodwill, are included in Corporate. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, nine product categories individually accounted for 5% or more of consolidated net sales as follows: ##TABLE_START  % of Sales by Product Category  2011 Fabric Care 20% 20% 20% Baby Care 13% 12% 12% Hair Care 11% 11% 11% Male Grooming 9% 9% 9% Beauty Care 7% 7% 7% Home Care 7% 7% 7% Family Care 6% 7% 7% Oral Care 6% 6% 6% Feminine Care 6% 6% 6% All Other 15% 15% 15% Total 100% 100% 100% ##TABLE_ENDThe Company had net sales in the U.S. of $29.5 billion , $29.9 billion and $29.5 billion for the years ended June 30, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Assets in the U.S. totaled $68.0 billion and $70.3 billion as of June 30, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. No other country's net sales or assets exceed 10% of the Company.

Under the terms of the agreement, Kellogg acquired our branded snacks products, our manufacturing facilities in Belgium and the United States and the majority of the employees working on the snacks business. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the transaction of $ 1.4 billion, which is included in net earnings from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the year ended June 30, 2012. The snacks business had historically been part of the Company's Snacks and Pet Care reportable segment. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the snacks business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all years presented. In October 2009, the Company completed the divestiture of our global pharmaceuticals business to Warner Chilcott plc (Warner Chilcott) for $2.8 billion of cash, net of assumed and transferred liabilities. Under the terms of the agreement, Warner Chilcott acquired our portfolio of branded pharmaceutical products, our prescription drug product pipeline and our manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and Germany. In addition, the majority of the employees working on the pharmaceuticals business were transferred to Warner Chilcott. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the transaction of $1.5 billion, which is included in net earnings from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the year ended June 30, 2010. The pharmaceuticals business had historically been part of the Company's Health Care reportable segment.

This plan was approved by the Company's Board of Directors on February 14, 1997. Although the plan has not been submitted to shareholders for approval, it is nearly identical to The Procter  Gamble 1992 Stock Plan, approved by the Company's shareholders on October 13, 1992, except for a few minor changes designed to comply with the Belgian tax laws. The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate key Belgian employees. Under the plan, eligible participants were: (i) granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii) granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii) granted shares of the Company's common stock. Except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights must vest in no less than one year from the date of grant and must expire no later than fifteen years from the date of grant. The exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan is the average price of the Company's stock on the date of grant. If a recipient of a grant leaves the Company while holding an unexercised option or right, any unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, and any exercisable portions become void within one month of departure, except in the case of death or retirement. Any common stock awarded under the plan may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the committee administering the plan may determine. The Procter  Gamble Future Shares Plan On October 14, 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved The Procter  Gamble Future Shares Plan pursuant to which options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock may be granted to employees worldwide. The purpose of this plan is to advance the interests of the Company by giving substantially all employees a stake in the Company's future growth and success and to strengthen the alignment of interests between employees and the Company's shareholders through increased ownership of shares of the Company's stock. The plan has not been submitted to shareholders for approval. Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company's capitalization, the number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 17 million shares. Under the plan's regulations, recipients are granted options to acquire 100 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price equal to the average price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant. These options vest five years after the date of grant and expire ten years following the date of grant. If a recipient leaves the employ of the Company prior 69   The Procter  Gamble Company to the vesting date for a reason other than disability, retirement or special separation (as defined in the plan), then the award is forfeited. At the time of the first grant following Board approval of the plan, each employee of the Company not eligible for an award under the 1992 Stock Plan was granted options for 100 shares. From the date of this first grant through June 30, 2003, each new employee of the Company has also received options for 100 shares. Following the grant of options on June 30, 2003, the Company suspended this part of the plan. The plan terminated on October 13, 2007. The Gillette Company 1971 Stock Option Plan No further grants can be made under the plan after April 25, 2005, although unexercised stock options previously granted under this plan remain outstanding. The plan was approved by shareholders of The Gillette Company and assumed by the Company upon the merger between The Procter  Gamble Company and The Gillette Company. All options became immediately vested and exercisable on October 1, 2005 as a result of the merger. After the merger, all outstanding options became options to purchase shares of The Procter  Gamble Company subject to an exchange ratio of .975 shares of PG stock per share of Gillette stock. The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate key salaried employees of The Gillette Company and non-employee members of its Board of Directors. Under the plan, eligible participants receive the option to purchase Company stock at a pre-determined price which cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value per share at the time that the option is granted. The period of any option may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company's capitalization, the number of shares granted under the plan was not to exceed 198,000,000 shares. If a recipient leaves the employ of the Company for any reason other than death or discharge for cause, the recipient is permitted to exercise any vested options granted under the plan for a period between thirty days and five years after termination, depending on the circumstances of his/her departure. If a participant is discharged for cause, all options are immediately cancelled. If a participant dies while holding options, the options are exercisable for a period of one to three years depending on the date of grant. In addition, the plan allows Gillette employees whose employment is terminated for \"Good Reason\" within two years after the effective date of the merger the ability to exercise remaining options for the shorter of five years following their termination date or the original life of the grant. Employees terminated for \"Good Reason\" who are also eligible to retire under a Company plan are allowed to exercise their options subject to the original terms of the grant. The Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan Shareholders of The Gillette Company approved The Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan on May 20, 2004, and the plan was assumed by the Company upon the merger between The Procter  Gamble Company and The Gillette Company. All options became immediately vested and exercisable on October 1, 2005 as a result of the merger. After the merger, all outstanding options became options to purchase shares of The Procter  Gamble Company subject to an exchange ratio of .975 shares of PG stock per share of Gillette stock. Only employees previously employed by The Gillette Company prior to October 1, 2005 are eligible to receive grants under this plan. The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate employees of The Gillette Company, and until the effective date of the merger between The Gillette Company and The Procter  Gamble Company, non-employee members of the Gillette Board of Directors. Under the plan, eligible participants are: (i) granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii) granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii) granted shares of the Company's common stock or restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents). Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company's capitalization and the addition of any shares authorized but not issued or redeemed under The Gillette Company 1971 Stock Option Plan, the number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 19,000,000 shares. Except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights must expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan must be equal to or greater than the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of grant. Any common stock awarded under the plan may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the committee administering the plan may determine.  If a recipient of a grant leaves the Company while holding an unexercised option or right: (1) any unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement, special separation (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has waived the termination provisions; and (2) any exercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement, special separation, voluntary resignation that is not for Good Reason (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has waived the termination provisions.

Business . Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Management's Discussion and Analysis (MDA); Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the \"Company,\" \"PG,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" as used herein refer to The Procter  Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries. The Procter  Gamble Company is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world's consumers. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having been built from a business founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. Today, we sell our products in more than 180 countries and territories. Throughout this Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Company's annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains these reports at: www.sec.gov. You can also access these reports through links from our website at: www.pg.com/investors. Copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting Computershare Inc., 250 Royall Street, Canton, MA 02021. Financial Information about Segments As of June 30, 2013, the Company has five reportable segments under U.S. GAAP: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. Many of the factors necessary for understanding these businesses are similar. Operating margins of the individual businesses vary due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products, the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. Net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets and product categories in which they operate. While none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components within certain reportable segments, such as Batteries (Fabric Care and Home Care), Appliances (Grooming) and Prestige Fragrances (Beauty) are seasonal. In addition, anticipation or occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, can drive unusually high demand for batteries. Additional information about our reportable segments can be found in MDA and Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Narrative Description of Business Business Model . Our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products, as well as the creation of new products. The markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons, e-commerce and high-frequency stores, the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. We work collaboratively with our customers to improve the in-store presence of our products and win the \"first moment of truth\" - when a consumer is shopping in the store. We must also win the \"second moment of truth\" - when a consumer uses the product, evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and decides whether it was a good value. We believe we must continue to provide new, innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business. Research and product development activities, designed to enable sustained organic growth, continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year. While many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years, we believe these activities demonstrate our commitment to future growth. Key Product Categories . Information on key product categories can be found in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Key Customers . Our customers include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, high-frequency stores, distributors and e-commerce retailers. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 14% of our total revenue in 2013 and 2012, and 15% in 2011. No other customer represents more than 10% of our net sales. Our top ten customers account for approximately 30%, 31% and 32% of our total unit volume in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government. We believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete. Sources and Availability of Materials . Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from others, some of which are single-source suppliers. We produce certain raw materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing process and in the distribution of input materials and finished product to customers. The prices we pay for materials and 14   The Procter  Gamble Company other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers. The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, none of which is material to our business taken as a whole. Trademarks and Patents . We own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. All major products and trademarks in each business are registered. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses. Competitive Condition . The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. We support our products with advertising, promotions and other vehicles to build awareness of our brands in conjunction with an extensive sales force. We believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products. Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important competitive factors. Research and Development Expenditures . Research and development expenditures enable us to develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of our consumers. Total research and development expenses were $2.0 billion in 2013, 2012 and 2011.  Expenditures for Environmental Compliance . Expenditures for compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not material to the Company. No material change is expected in fiscal year 2014. Employees . Total number of employees is an estimate of total Company employees excluding interns, co-ops and employees of joint ventures. The number of employees includes manufacturing and non-manufacturing employees. A discussion of progress on non-manufacturing enrollment objectives is included in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Historical numbers include employees of discontinued operations.  ##TABLE_START  Total Number of Employees 121,000 126,000 129,000 127,000 132,000 135,000 ##TABLE_ENDFinancial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations Net sales in the United States account for approximately 36% of total net sales. No other individual country exceeds 10% of total net sales. Operations outside the United States are generally characterized by the same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may be affected by additional factors including changing currency values, different rates of inflation, economic growth and political and economic uncertainties and disruptions.

Risk Factors. We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-K, other quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the The Procter  Gamble Company   15  time the statements are made, which may become out of date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. The following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with MDA and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes incorporated in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. A change in consumer demand for our products and/or lack of market growth could have a significant impact on our business.  We are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. We expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by focusing on the most profitable businesses, biggest innovations and most important emerging markets. We also expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. If demand for our products and/or market growth rates in either developed or developing markets falls substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our volume, and consequently our results, could be negatively impacted. This could occur due to, among other things, unforeseen negative economic or political events, changes in consumer trends and habits or negative consumer responses to pricing actions. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels. The consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, there are ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. This includes, among other things, increasing competition from mid- and lower-tier value products in both developed and developing markets. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms. In addition, the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer and consumer preferences, as well as market dynamics. Failure to effectively compete in these new channels could negatively impact results. Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and our ability to successfully respond to competitive innovation . Achieving our business results depends, in part, on the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products and improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. Successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance, to obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of others. We must also be able to successfully respond to technological advances made by competitors and intellectual property rights granted to competitors. Failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our results. Our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, energy costs, pension and healthcare costs and foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. In addition, our financial projections include cost savings described in our announced productivity plan. Failure to deliver these savings could adversely impact our results. We face risks that are inherent in global manufacturing that could negatively impact our business results. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements, to achieve our cost targets. While we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials, it may be impracticable to have a sufficient alternative source, particularly when the input materials are in limited supply. In addition, our strategy for global growth includes increased presence in emerging markets. Some emerging markets have greater political volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than established markets. Any significant disruption of manufacturing, such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, have an adverse impact on our business. 16   The Procter  Gamble Company We face risks associated with having significant international operations. We are a global company, with manufacturing operations in more than 40 countries and a significant portion of our revenue is outside the U.S. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to: ##TABLE_START  compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with a variety of local regulations and laws; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from overseas; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales outside the United States. ##TABLE_END We have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange, import authorization or pricing controls, including, but not limited to, Venezuela, Argentina, China, India and Egypt. Our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment. Fluctuations in exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition. We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States are translated into U.S. dollars. Our operations outside of the U.S. generate a significant portion of our net revenue. Fluctuations in exchange rates may therefore adversely impact our business results or financial condition. See also the Results of Operations and Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity sections of the MDA and Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We face risks related to changes in the global and political economic environment, including the global capital and credit markets. Our business is impacted by global economic conditions, which continue to be volatile. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world. If the global economy experiences significant disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to: a slow-down in the general economy; supplier, vendor or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets; and/or temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. Our objective is to maintain credit ratings that provide us with ready access to global capital and credit markets. Any downgrade of our current credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. We could also be negatively impacted by political issues or crises in individual countries or regions, including sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments. For example, we could be adversely impacted by continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the European Union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the United States. Consequently, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographies, as well as any political or economic disruption. These risks could negatively impact our overall liquidity and financing costs, as well as our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, and/or create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions. If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. The Company's reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, such as customers and suppliers. In addition, many of our brands have worldwide recognition. This recognition is the result of the large investments we have made in our products over many years. The quality and safety of our products is critical to our business. Our Company also devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, efficacy or similar matters, these issues could negatively impact sentiments toward the Company or our products, our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer. Our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands and the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit The Procter  Gamble Company   17  products. In addition, given the association of our individual products with the Company, an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products, or the Company as a whole, thereby potentially hurting results. Our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change could impact our business results. We recently experienced a CEO transition, as well as other senior leadership changes, and we continue to execute a number of significant business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies. We expect these types of changes, which may include many staffing adjustments as well as employee departures, to continue for the foreseeable future. Successfully managing these changes, including retention of particularly key employees, is critical to our business success. Further, ongoing business and organizational changes are likely to result in more reliance on third parties for various services and that reliance may increase reputational, operational and compliance risks, including the risk of corruption. We are generally a build-from-within company and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes developing organization capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense. Finally, our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement. If we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities could impact our business results. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, 2) we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with divested brands, or 3) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions and joint ventures, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets. Additionally, joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with each joint venture. Our business is subject to changes in legislation, regulation and enforcement, and our ability to manage and resolve pending legal matters in the United States and abroad. Changes in laws, regulations and related interpretations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and increased enforcement actions and penalties may alter the environment in which we do business. As a U.S. based multinational company we are subject to tax regulations in the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the United States is not taxed in the United States, provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. If these or other tax regulations should change, our financial results could be impacted. In addition, our ability to manage regulatory, environmental, tax and legal matters (including, but not limited to, product liability, patent and other intellectual property matters) and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability may materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Furthermore, if pending legal matters, including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. There are increasing calls in the United States from members of leadership in both major U.S. political parties for comprehensive tax reform which may significantly change the income tax rules that are applicable to U.S. domiciled corporations, such as PG. It is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential legislation would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flows, but such changes could significantly impact our financial results. A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We sell most of our products via retail customers, which consist of mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, high-frequency stores, distributors and e-commerce retailers. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. This includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. Our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of our products or experience a significant business disruption. Consolidation among our retail customers could also create significant cost and margin pressure and lead to more complexity across broader geographic boundaries for both us 18   The Procter  Gamble Company and our key retailers. This would be particularly challenging if major customers are addressing local trade pressures, local law and regulation changes or financial distress. A failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. We rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems, networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. The various uses of these IT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: ##TABLE_START  ordering and managing materials from suppliers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  converting materials to finished products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  shipping products to customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  marketing and selling products to consumers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  processing transactions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  summarizing and reporting results of operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  providing data security; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  handling other processes necessary to manage our business. ##TABLE_END Increased IT security threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of our IT systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. If the IT systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and reputational, competitive and/or business harm, which may adversely impact our results of operations and/or financial condition.

The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax.

Management's Discussion and Analysis Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including, without limitation, in the following sections: Management's Discussion and Analysis and Risk Factors. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believe, project, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, strategy, future, opportunity, plan, may, should, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled \"Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks\" and the section titled Risk Factors (Item 1A of this Form 10-K). Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. The following Management's Discussion and Analysis (MDA) is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of PG's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. MDA is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. MDA is organized in the following sections: ##TABLE_START  Overview ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Summary of 2013 Results ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Results of Operations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Segment Results ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Information  ##TABLE_END Throughout MDA, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain specified charges and gains. Free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of MDA provides more details on the use and derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in MDA are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category and are measured on an annual basis versus the prior 12 month period. References to competitive activity include promotional and product initiatives from our competitors. OVERVIEW PG is a global leader in retail goods focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons and high-frequency stores. We continue to expand our presence in other channels, including perfumeries, pharmacies and e-commerce. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. 24   The Procter  Gamble Company ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE Our organizational structure is comprised of Global Business Units (GBUs), Global Operations, Global Business Services (GBS) and Corporate Functions (CF). Global Business Units Under U.S. GAAP, the GBUs are aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. The GBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the key product categories and brand composition within each segment. ##TABLE_START Reportable Segment % of Net Sales* % of Net Earnings* GBUs (Categories) Billion Dollar Brands Beauty 24% 21% Beauty Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Cosmetics, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); Hair Care and Color; Prestige (SK-II, Fragrances); Salon Professional Head  Shoulders, Olay, Pantene, SK-II, Wella Grooming 9% 16% Shave Care (Blades and Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products); Braun and Appliances Fusion, Gillette, Mach3, Prestobarba Health Care 15% 17% Feminine Care (Feminine Care, Incontinence); Oral Care (Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Other Personal Health Care, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements) Always, Crest, Oral-B, Vicks Fabric Care and Home Care 32% 27% Fabric Care (Bleach and Laundry Additives, Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, Surface Care); Personal Power (Batteries); Pet Care; Professional Ace, Ariel, Dawn, Downy, Duracell, Febreze, Gain, Iams, Tide Baby Care and Family Care 20% 19% Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper) Bounty, Charmin, Pampers ##TABLE_END*  Percent of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2013 (excluding results held in Corporate). Recent Developments: In fiscal 2012, we completed the divestiture of our snacks business to The Kellogg Company. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of our snacks business are presented as discontinued operations in 2012 and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and from segment results for all periods presented. Beauty: We are a global market leader in the beauty category. Most of the beauty markets in which we compete are highly fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. We compete in beauty care, hair care and color and prestige. In beauty care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to cosmetics to skin care, such as our Olay brand, which is the top facial skin care brand in the world with approximately 10% global market share. In hair care and color, we compete in both the retail and salon professional channels. We are the global market leader in the hair care and color market with over 20% global market share behind our Pantene and Head  Shoulders brands. In the prestige channel, we compete primarily with our prestige fragrances and the SK-II brand. We are the global market leader in prestige fragrances, primarily behind our Dolce  Gabbana, Gucci and Hugo Boss fragrance brands. Grooming: We are the global market leader in the blades and razors market globally and in nearly all of the geographies in which we compete. Our global blades and razors market share is approximately 70%, primarily behind the Gillette franchise including Fusion, Mach3, Prestobarba and Venus. Our electronic hair removal devices, such as electric razors and epilators, are sold under the Braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. We hold over 20% of the male shavers market and over 40% of the female epilators market. Health Care: We compete in oral care, feminine care and personal health care. In oral care, there are several global competitors in the market and we have the number two market share position with approximately 20% global market share. We are the global market leader in the feminine care category with over 30% global market share. In personal health care, we are the global market leader in nonprescription heartburn medications behind our Prilosec OTC brand and in respiratory treatments behind our Vicks brand. Nearly all of our sales outside the U.S in personal health are generated through the PGT Healthcare partnership with Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd.  The Procter  Gamble Company   25  Fabric Care and Home Care: This segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products, including: laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; home care products, including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners; batteries; and pet care. In fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader, with over 25% global market share, primarily behind our Tide, Ariel and Downy brands. Our global home care market share is approximately 20% across the categories in which we compete. In batteries, we have over 25% global battery market share, behind our Duracell brand. In pet care, we compete in several markets primarily in the premium pet care segment, with the Iams and Eukanuba brands. The vast majority of our pet care business is in North America, where we have over 5% market share. Baby Care and Family Care: In baby care, we compete mainly in diapers, pants and baby wipes, with approximately 35% global market share. We are the number one or number two baby care competitor in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind Pampers, the Company's largest brand, with annual net sales of more than $10 billion. Our family care business is predominantly a North American business comprised largely of the Bounty paper towel and Charmin toilet paper brands. U.S. market shares are approximately 45% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin. Fiscal Year 2014 Changes to Global Business Unit Structure We recently announced a number of changes to our GBU structure, which will result in changes to our reportable segments. Effective July 1, 2013, as part of our plan to improve business performance, we organized our Global Business Units into four industry-based sectors, comprised of 1) Global Baby, Feminine and Family Care, 2) Global Beauty, 3) Global Health and Grooming, and 4) Global Fabric and Home Care. Under U.S. GAAP, the GBUs underlying these sectors will be aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Global Baby, Feminine and Family Care, 2) Global Beauty, 3) Global Health, 4) Grooming and 5) Global Fabric and Home Care. As a result, Feminine Care will transition from Health Care to Global Baby, Feminine and Family Care. Additionally, Pet Care will transition from Fabric Care and Home Care to Global Health. These changes will be reflected in our segment reporting beginning in fiscal year 2014, at which time our historical segment reporting will also be restated to reflect the new structure. The segment discussions in MDA and the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the organizational structure that existed through June 30, 2013. Global Operations Global Operations is comprised of our Market Development Organization (MDO), which is responsible for developing go-to-market plans at the local level. The MDO includes dedicated retail customer, trade channel and country-specific teams. It is organized along five geographic regions: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa (CEEMEA), Latin America and Asia, which is comprised of Japan, Greater China and ASEAN/Australia/India/Korea (AAIK). Throughout MDA, we reference business results in developing markets, which we define as the aggregate of CEEMEA, Latin America, AAIK and Greater China, and developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan. Global Business Services GBS provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the GBUs and the MDO to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment. Corporate Functions CF provides Company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources and legal, as well as other centralized functional support. STRATEGIC FOCUS We are focused on strategies that we believe are right for the long-term health of the Company with the objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. We are focusing our resources on our leading, most profitable categories and markets. ##TABLE_START  We will focus on our core markets, such as the U.S., to strengthen and grow these businesses. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We will focus our developing market investments on the categories and countries with the largest size of prize and highest likelihood of winning. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We will focus the portfolio, allocating resources to businesses where we can create disproportionate value. ##TABLE_END To create flexibility to fund our growth efforts and deliver our financial commitments, we are working to make productivity a core strength for PG. We have taken significant steps to accelerate cost savings, including a five-year cost savings initiative which was announced in February 2012. The cost savings program covers all elements of costs including cost of goods sold, marketing expense and non-manufacturing overhead. Innovation has always been - and continues to be - PG's lifeblood. To consistently win with consumers around the world across price tiers and preferences and to consistently win versus our best competitors, each PG product category needs a full portfolio of innovation, including a mix of commercial programs, product improvements and game-changing innovations. 26   The Procter  Gamble Company Finally, we are focused on improving operating discipline in everything we do. Executing better than our competitors is how we win with customers and consumers and generate leadership returns for our shareholders. Given current market growth rates, the Company expects the consistent delivery of the following annual financial targets will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive peer group: ##TABLE_START  Grow organic sales modestly above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Deliver Core EPS growth of high single digits, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Generate free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater. ##TABLE_ENDSUMMARY OF 2013 RESULTS ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions, except per share amounts  Change vs. Prior Year   Change vs. Prior Year  Net sales $ 84,167  1%  $ 83,680  3%  $ 81,104 Operating income 14,481  9%  13,292  (14)%  15,495 Net earnings from continuing operations 11,402  22%  9,317  (20)%  11,698 Net earnings from discontinued operations   (100)%  1,587  593%  Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble 11,312  5%  10,756  (9)%  11,797 Diluted net earnings per common share 3.86  5%  3.66  (7)%  3.93 Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations 3.86  24%  3.12  (19)%  3.85 Core earnings per common share 4.05  5%  3.85  (1)%  3.87 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net sales increased 1% to $84.2 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Organic sales increased 3%. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Unit volume increased 2% due to low single-digit increases in both developing and developed regions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble were $11.3 billion, an increase of $556 million or 5% versus the prior year period. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net earnings from continuing operations increased $2.1 billion, or 22%, to $11.4 billion. The combination of the net year-over-year impact of acquisition and divestiture gains and the net year-over-year decline in impairment charges drove $1.9 billion of the increase. The remaining increase was largely due to net sales growth and gross margin expansion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $1.6 billion due to the gain on the sale of the snacks business and the earnings of the snacks business prior to the divestiture in the prior year period. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted net earnings per share increased 5% to $3.86. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 24% to $3.86. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Core EPS increased 5% to $4.05. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash flow from operating activities was $14.9 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Free cash flow was $10.9 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Free cash flow productivity was 95%. ##TABLE_END ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES AND RISKS We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are \"forward-looking statements\" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in this 10-K. Ability to Achieve Business Plans . We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail The Procter  Gamble Company   27  trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation with respect to both products and operations, on the continued positive reputations of our brands and our ability to successfully maintain trademark protection. This means we must be able to obtain patents and trademarks, and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing net sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms and product initiatives. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of ongoing acquisition, divestiture and joint venture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Daily conduct of our business also depends on our ability to maintain key information technology systems, including systems operated by third-party suppliers and to maintain security over our data. Cost Pressures . Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions, as well as consistent productivity improvements. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in certain countries with currency exchange controls, such as Venezuela, China, India, Egypt and Argentina. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and manufacturing plant arrangements, and successfully manage any disruptions at Company manufacturing sites. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce optimization. Successfully managing these changes, including identifying, developing and retaining key employees, is critical to our success. Global Economic Conditions . Demand for our products has a correlation to global macroeconomic factors. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic. Economic changes, terrorist activity, political unrest and natural disasters may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, due to terrorist and other hostile activities or natural disasters. We could also be negatively impacted by a global, regional or national economic crisis, including sovereign risk in the event of a deterioration in the credit worthiness of, or a default by local governments, resulting in a disruption of credit markets. Such events could negatively impact our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions and/or negatively impact our overall liquidity. Additionally, changes in exchange controls and other limits could impact our ability to repatriate earnings from overseas. Regulatory Environment . Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and tax laws or the enforcement thereof. Our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including, but not limited to, product liability, patent and other intellectual property matters) and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA), other non-operating items and income taxes. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, geographic expansion and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the U.S. Most of our cost of products sold and SGA are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, product and geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary drivers of SGA are marketing-related costs and overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we do achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. Overhead costs are also variable in nature, but on a relative basis, less so than marketing costs due to our 28   The Procter  Gamble Company ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth. Accordingly, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs. In February and November 2012, the Company made announcements related to a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overhead expenses. The plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the Company's growth strategy. The Company expects to incur in excess of $3.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a five-year period (fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2016) as part of this plan. Overall, the costs are expected to deliver in excess of $2.0 billion in before-tax annual savings. Net Sales Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Net sales increased 1% to $84.2 billion in 2013 on a 2% increase in unit volume. Volume in Baby Care and Family Care grew mid-single digits. Volume in Fabric Care and Home Care and in Health Care grew low single digits. Beauty volume was in line with the prior year. Grooming volume decreased low single digits. Volume grew low single digits in both developed and developing regions. The impact of overall global market growth was partially offset by market share declines in certain categories. Price increases added 1% to net sales, driven by price increases across all business segments, primarily executed in prior periods to offset cost increases and devaluing developing market currencies. Foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Organic sales growth was 3% driven by both volume and price increases. Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 Net sales increased 3% to $83.7 billion in 2012 on unit volume that was consistent with the prior year period. Difficult macroeconomic conditions caused a slowdown in market growth in fiscal 2012, particularly in developed markets. In addition, we initiated a number of price increases across each reportable segment in fiscal 2012, in large part to recover the rising cost of commodities and currency devaluations. These factors negatively impacted volume growth in 2012, but the price increases led to higher overall sales. Volume grew low single digits in Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, and Baby Care and Family Care. Fabric Care and Home Care volume decreased low single digits. Volume grew mid-single digits in developing regions and was down low single digits in developed regions. The impact of overall global market growth was partially offset by market share declines in certain categories. Price increases added 4% to net sales, driven by price increases across all business segments and regions, primarily to help offset commodity costs and devaluing currencies in certain developing markets. Mix reduced net sales by 1% due to unfavorable geographic mix across the Beauty, Grooming, Health Care and Fabric Care and Home Care reportable segments and unfavorable product mix. Foreign exchange was neutral to net sales. Organic sales growth was 3% driven by price increases.

Gross margin was positively impacted by 70 basis points from higher pricing and approximately 160 basis points from manufacturing cost savings. Gross margin was negatively impacted by 160 basis points from negative geographic and product mix behind disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier products, both of which have lower gross margins than the Company average. Gross margin was also reduced by capacity investments and to a lesser extent by foreign exchange impacts and higher commodity costs. Total SGA increased 2% to $27.0 billion in 2013, driven by a charge for the balance sheet impact from the devaluation of the official foreign exchange rate in Venezuela and an increase in marketing spending, partially The Procter  Gamble Company   29  offset by reduced overhead costs as a result of the productivity and cost savings plan. SGA as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points to 32.0% largely due to a 40 basis point impact from the Venezuela devaluation charge and a 10 basis point increase in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales declined 20 basis points, as a 70-basis point benefit from our productivity and cost savings plan and 20 basis points of lower restructuring costs were largely offset by the impact of foreign exchange. This was due to a higher portion of SGA spending in strengthening currencies as compared to net sales, higher employee wages and benefit costs and increased merchandising investments. In fiscal 2013 we incurred impairment charges of $308 million ($290 million after-tax) related to the carrying value of goodwill in our Appliances business and the related Braun trade name intangible asset. In fiscal 2012 we incurred impairment charges of $1.6 billion ($1.5 billion after-tax) related to the carrying values of goodwill in our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses and our Koleston Perfect and Wella indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are part of our Salon Professional business. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details, including factors leading to the impairment charges. Since goodwill is included in Corporate for internal management and segment reporting, the goodwill impairment charges are included in the Corporate segment. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments are also included in the Corporate segment for management and segment reporting. Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 Gross margin contracted 160 basis points in 2012 to 49.3% of net sales. The reduction in gross margin was driven mainly by a 230-basis point impact from higher commodity and energy costs. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by 200 basis points from negative geographic and product mix and by 30 basis points from the impact of increased restructuring spending due to the productivity and cost savings plan. The negative mix resulted from disproportionate growth in developing regions, as developing regions have lower relative gross margins than developed regions. These impacts were partially offset by a 200-basis point impact from increased pricing and a 140-basis point impact from manufacturing cost savings. Total SGA increased 3% to $26.4 billion in 2012, driven by higher marketing spending to support initiative activity and a $510 million increase in restructuring spending from our productivity and cost savings plan, partially offset by a reduction in competition law fines (see Item 3 of this Form 10-K and Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), which were $303 million in 2011 compared to $75 million in 2012. SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 31.5%, as reduced competition law fines and the impact of increased scale leverage on marketing and overhead costs from higher sales were partially offset by 60 basis points of incremental restructuring costs. Non-Operating Items Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Interest expense decreased 13% in 2013 to $667 million, due to lower interest rates on floating-rate debt. Interest income increased 13% in 2013 to $87 million, due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and debt securities. Other non-operating income, net primarily includes divestiture gains and investment income. Other non-operating income increased $757 million to $942 million in 2013 mainly due to net acquisition and divestiture activities. A holding gain of $631 million resulting from the purchase of the balance of PG's Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia and a gain of approximately $250 million from the sale of our Italian bleach business, both in the current year, were partially offset by a $130 million divestiture gain from the PUR water filtration business in the prior year period. Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 In 2012, interest expense decreased 7% to $769 million, due to lower interest rates on floating-rate debt and a decrease in average debt outstanding. Interest income increased 24% in 2012 to $77 million, due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and debt securities. Other non-operating income, net decreased $86 million to $185 million in 2012 mainly behind the impact of minor brand divestitures. A divestiture gain from the sale of the PUR water filtration brand in fiscal 2012 was less than the Zest and Infasil divestiture gains in fiscal 2011. Income Taxes Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 390 basis points to 23.2% in 2013. The primary drivers of this rate decline were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Approximately 210 basis points due to the non-deductibility of impairment charges related to our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses, which were higher in the base period versus the current year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Approximately 100 basis points due to the tax impacts from acquisition and divestiture activity (primarily the non-taxable gain on the purchase of the balance of the Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Approximately 50 basis points due to the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions. The current year net benefit was $275, or 180 basis points, versus a net benefit of 130 basis points in the prior year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Approximately 20 basis points from the impact of the Venezuela currency devaluation. ##TABLE_END 30   The Procter  Gamble Company Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 In 2012, the effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 510 basis points to 27.1% primarily due to a 250-basis point impact from the non-deductibility of impairment charges in fiscal 2012 and the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions, which drove 250 basis points of the tax rate difference. The net benefit from favorable discrete adjustments was $165 million in fiscal 2012, which netted to 130 basis points, versus 380 basis points of net benefits in fiscal 2011. Net Earnings Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Net earnings from continuing operations increased $2.1 billion or 22% to $11.4 billion in 2013. The combination of the net year-over-year impact of acquisition and divestiture gains and the net year-over-year decline in impairment charges drove $1.9 billion of the increase. Earnings also increased due to the increase in net sales and the 30-basis point gross margin expansion in the current year. Net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $1.6 billion in 2013 due to the gain on the divestiture of the snacks business and the earnings from the snacks business prior to the divestiture in the prior year period. Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble increased $556 million, or 5% to $11.3 billion. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 24% to $3.86 due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in shares outstanding. The number of shares outstanding decreased due to $6.0 billion of treasury share repurchases under our publicly announced share repurchase program, partially offset by shares issued under share-based compensation plans. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations was $0.54 in the prior year period (zero in the current period) due to the gain on the divestiture of the snacks business and earnings of the snacks business prior to the divestiture. Diluted net earnings per share increased 5% to $3.86. Core EPS increased 5% to $4.05 primarily due to increased net sales, gross margin expansion and the reduction in shares outstanding. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the current period charge for the balance sheet impact from the devaluation of the official foreign exchange rate in Venezuela, the current year holding gain on the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture and charges in both years for European legal matters, incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan and impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 In 2012, net earnings from continuing operations decreased 20% to $9.3 billion as an increase in net sales was more than offset by the impact of impairment charges, incremental restructuring charges and an increase in income taxes. Operating margin declined 320 basis points due primarily to a 190-basis point impact from goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges in our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses and an 85-basis point impact from incremental restructuring charges. The impact of higher commodity costs and negative product mix was largely offset by higher pricing, manufacturing cost savings and increased scale leverage. Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $1.4 billion in 2012 due to the gain on the divestiture of the snacks business. Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble declined 9% to $10.8 billion. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 19% in 2012 to $3.12 due to the decline in net earnings, partially offset by a reduction in shares outstanding. The reduction in the number of shares outstanding was driven by treasury share repurchases of $4.0 billion, which were made under our publicly announced share repurchase program, partially offset by shares issued under share-based compensation plans. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations increased $0.46 due to the gain on the divestiture of the snacks business, partially offset by a decrease in the earnings of the snacks business prior to the divestiture. Diluted net earnings per share decreased 7% from the prior year to $3.66 in fiscal 2012. Core EPS in 2012 decreased 1% to $3.85. Venezuela Currency Impacts Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. As a result, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Venezuela. Any currency remeasurement adjustments for non-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by these subsidiaries and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. The Venezuelan government has established one official exchange rate for qualifying dividends and imported goods and services. That rate was equal to 4.3 Bolivares Fuertes (VEF) to one U.S. dollar through February 12, 2013. Effective February 13, 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency relative to the U.S. dollar from 4.3 to 6.3 (official rate). The remeasurement of our balance sheets in 2013 to reflect the impact of the devaluation resulted in a net after-tax charge of $236 million ($0.08 per share). There will also be an ongoing impact related to translating our income statement at the new exchange rates. Moving from the 4.3 rate to the 6.3 rate will reduce future total Company reported net sales by less than 1% on a going basis. This does not impact our organic sales growth rate, which excludes the impact of foreign currency changes. Versus our existing business plans, the exchange rate change reduced our reported earnings per share by approximately $0.04 per share in 2013. The Procter  Gamble Company   31  Transactions at the official exchange rate are subject to CADIVI (Venezuelan government's Foreign Exchange Administrative Commission). Our overall results in Venezuela are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at the official rate, which is currently the rate expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations. In addition to the official exchange rate, there had been a parallel exchange market (SITME) that was controlled by the Central Bank of Venezuela as the only legal intermediary to execute foreign exchange transactions outside of CADIVI. The published rate was 5.3 through February 12, 2013. The notional amount of transactions that ran through this foreign exchange rate for nonessential goods was restrictive, which for us essentially eliminated our ability to access any foreign exchange rate other than the official CADIVI rate to pay for imported goods and/or manage our local monetary asset balances. When the government devalued its currency in February, 2013, it also eliminated SITME, but established a new exchange rate market program, referred to as SICAD. As of June 30, 2013, there is little official information available on the new auction process or the underlying auction rates. As of June 30, 2013, we had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of $913 million. Local currency balances decreased 14% since June 30, 2012 due to the impact of the February 2013 devaluation and an increase in payments by the government through CADIVI, partially offset by an increase in the net amount of indirect value added taxes (VAT) receivable from the government from goods receipts and shipments. Prior to the February 2013 devaluation, a portion of our net monetary assets denominated in local currency was remeasured using the SITME rate because we planned to use that amount of the net assets (largely cash) to satisfy U.S. dollar denominated liabilities that do not qualify for official rate dollars. The remaining net monetary asset balances had been reflected within our Consolidated Financial Statements at the 4.3 official exchange rate. However, as noted in the preceding paragraph, the parallel SITME market was eliminated at the time of the February 2013 devaluation, and there is little information available on the SICAD mechanism. Accordingly, all of our net monetary assets are measured at the official 6.3 exchange rate at June 30, 2013. Additionally, the Venezuelan government enacted a price control law during the second half of fiscal 2012 that negatively impacted the net selling prices of certain products sold in Venezuela. Depending on the ultimate transparency and liquidity of the SICAD market, it is possible that we may remeasure a portion of our net monetary balances (the amount of the net assets needed to satisfy U.S. dollar denominated liabilities that do not qualify for official rate dollars, approximately $240 million as of June 30, 2013) at the SICAD rate. This would result in an additional devaluation charge. Over time, we intend to restore net sales and profit to levels achieved prior to the devaluation. However, our ability to do so will be impacted by several factors. These include the Company's ability to mitigate the effect of the recently enacted price controls, any potential future devaluation, any further Venezuelan government price or exchange controls, economic conditions and the availability of raw materials and utilities. In addition, depending on the future availability of U.S. dollars at the official rate, our local U.S. dollar needs, our overall repatriation plans, the creditworthiness of the local depository institutions and other creditors and our ability to collect amounts due from customers and the government, including VAT receivable, we may have exposure for our local monetary assets. We also have devaluation exposure for the differential between the current and potential future official exchange rates. SEGMENT RESULTS Segment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs such as interest expense, investing activities and certain restructuring and asset impairment costs. These costs are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, as described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have investments in certain companies over which we exert significant influence, but do not control the financial and operating decisions and, therefore, do not consolidate these companies for U.S. GAAP purposes (\"unconsolidated entities\"). Given that certain of these investments are managed as integral parts of the Company's business units, they are accounted for as if they were consolidated subsidiaries for management and segment reporting purposes. This means pre-tax earnings in the business units include 100% of each pre-tax income statement component. In determining after-tax earnings in the business units, we eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest, and apply the statutory tax rates. Eliminations to adjust each line item to U.S. GAAP are included in our Corporate segment. All references to net earnings throughout the discussion of segment results refer to net earnings from continuing operations. 32   The Procter  Gamble Company ##TABLE_START Net Sales Change Drivers (2013 vs. 2012)  Volume with Acquisitions  Divestitures  Volume Excluding Acquisitions  Divestitures  Foreign Exchange  Price  Mix  Other  Net Sales Growth Beauty 0%  0%  -2%  2%  -1%  -1%  -2% Grooming -1%  0%  -4%  2%  0%  -1%  -4% Health Care 3%  3%  -3%  1%  1%  1%  3% Fabric Care and Home Care 3%  3%  -2%  1%  -1%  0%  1% Baby Care and Family Care 4%  4%  -2%  1%  -1%  0%  2% TOTAL COMPANY 2%  2%  -2%  1%  0%  0%  1% ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Net Sales Change Drivers (2012 vs. 2011)  Volume with Acquisitions  Divestitures  Volume Excluding Acquisitions  Divestitures  Foreign Exchange  Price  Mix  Other  Net Sales Growth Beauty 2%  2%  0%  3%  -3%  0%  2% Grooming 1%  1%  -1%  2%  -1%  0%  1% Health Care 1%  0%  0%  3%  -1%  0%  3% Fabric Care and Home Care -1%  -1%  0%  5%  -1%  0%  3% Baby Care and Family Care 1%  1%  0%  5%  0%  0%  6% TOTAL COMPANY 0%  0%  0%  4%  -1%  0%  3% ##TABLE_ENDNet sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.

Global market share of the hair care and color category was down more than half a point. Volume in Beauty Care was in line with the prior year period. A low single-digit volume increase in personal cleansing and a mid-single-digit increase in deodorants, driven by innovation and market growth in developing regions, was offset by a mid-single-digit decline in facial skin care, where global market share decreased about a point. Volume in Salon Professional was in line with the prior year period due to mid-single-digit growth in developing markets behind new innovations, offset by a low single-digit decline in developed regions from market contraction. Volume in Prestige was in line with the prior year period due to minor brand divestitures and market contraction in Western Europe, offset by innovation and market growth in developing markets. Organic volume in Prestige increased low single digits. Net earnings increased 4% to $2.5 billion, as lower net sales were more than offset by a 60-basis point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to gross margin expansion, a decrease in SGA as a percentage of sales and a lower effective tax rate. Gross margin increased behind manufacturing cost savings and higher pricing. SGA as a percentage of net sales declined largely due to reduced overhead spending. The effective tax rate declined due to the geographic mix of earnings. Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 Beauty net sales increased 2% to $20.3 billion in 2012 on unit volume growth of 2%. Organic sales also grew 2% on 2% organic volume growth.

Volume in developed regions was down low single digits due to competitive activity. Global market share of the hair care category was unchanged. Volume in Beauty Care decreased mid-single digits due to the Zest and Infasil divestitures and the impact of competitive activity in North America and Western Europe which contributed to about half a point of global share loss. Volume in Salon Professional was down high single digits mainly due to market contraction in Europe and the impact of competitive activity. Volume in Prestige Products increased mid-single digits driven by initiative activity, partially offset by minor brand divestitures. Net earnings decreased 6% to $2.4 billion as higher net sales were more than offset by a 100-basis point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due to gross margin contraction partially offset by lower SGA as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin decreased primarily due to an increase in commodity costs and unfavorable geographic and product mix, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and higher pricing. SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased due to scale leverage from increased sales.

Oral Care volume increased mid-single digits due to geographic expansion, innovation and market growth. Global market share of the oral care category was down slightly. Volume in Personal Health Care increased mid-single digits partially due to a net increase from prior year acquisition and divestiture activity (the addition of the PGT Healthcare partnership and New Chapter VMS, partially offset by the divestiture of the PuR business). Organic volume increased low single digits primarily due to the launch of ZzzQuil and geographic expansion for Vicks. Volume in Feminine Care increased low single digits with mid-single-digit growth in developing markets behind market growth and innovation partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in developed regions due to increased promotional activity from competition and market contraction. Global market share of the feminine care category was down half a point. Net earnings increased 4% to $1.9 billion due to higher net sales and a 10-basis point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to a reduction in overhead spending, partially offset by an increase in marketing spending and gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased due to increased commodity costs and supply chain investments, partially offset by higher pricing and manufacturing cost savings. Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 Health Care net sales increased 3% to $12.4 billion in 2012 on 1% growth in unit volume. Organic sales were up 2% on flat organic volume. Price increases contributed 3% to net sales growth. Mix negatively impacted net sales by 1% due to disproportionate growth in certain developing countries and products with lower than segment average selling prices. Global market share of the Health Care segment decreased 0.1 points. Volume increased mid-single digits in developing regions and decreased low single digits in developed regions. Oral Care volume was in line with the prior year period as the expansion of Oral-B toothpaste in Western Europe and Latin America was offset by the impact of competitive activity in developed markets and Asia and lost volume following price increases in Asia. Global market share of the oral care category was down slightly. Volume in Personal Health Care increased low single digits driven by the addition of the PGT Healthcare partnership. Organic volume was down low single digits as the benefits from market growth were more than offset by lower shipments of Prilosec OTC in North America. All-outlet value share of the U.S. personal health care market was down slightly. Volume in Feminine Care was up low single digits driven by mid-single-digit growth in developing markets due to market growth and initiative activity in India, Brazil and CEEMEA. Feminine Care global market share was down about half a point. Net earnings increased 2% to $1.8 billion behind higher net sales partially offset by a 20-basis point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due to gross margin contraction, partially offset by lower SGA as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin declined due to higher commodity costs and unfavorable product and geographic mix, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and price increases. SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to scale leverage from increased sales.

CORPORATE ##TABLE_START ($ millions)  Change vs 2012   Change vs Net sales $(895)  -22%  $(1,145)  -9% Net earnings $(175)  N/A  $(1,744)  N/A ##TABLE_ENDCorporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical results of certain divested brands and categories; certain asset impairment charges; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate net sales, cost of products sold and SGA for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and noncontrolling interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Since certain unconsolidated entities and less than 100%-owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the related segments, they are accounted for similar to a wholly-owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings in the segments, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests in Corporate. In determining segment net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company's effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest. Corporate net sales primarily reflect the adjustment to eliminate the sales of unconsolidated entities included in business segment results. Accordingly, Corporate net sales are generally negative. Negative net sales in Corporate for 2013 decreased by $250 million due to 1) the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture (after which this business is consolidated for both segment and consolidated results and the underlying sales no longer need to be eliminated) and 2) smaller adjustments required to eliminate reduced sales of the remaining unconsolidated entities. Corporate net earnings improved $1.6 billion primarily due to reduced net after-tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges (which totaled $1.5 billion in the prior year as compared to $290 million in the current period), along with the current year net after-tax holding gain related to the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture, partially offset by the current year charge for the impact of the Venezuela devaluation. Additional discussion of the items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section. In 2012, negative net sales in Corporate decreased by $108 million due to adjustments required to eliminate the lower net sales of unconsolidated entities. Corporate net earnings declined $2.2 billion primarily due to the net after tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $1.5 billion, incremental after-tax restructuring charges of $587 million and the impact of lower net discrete tax adjustments in 2012. Additional discussion of the items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section above. Productivity and Cost Savings Plan In February and November 2012, the Company made announcements related to a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. As part of this plan, the Company expects to incur in excess of $3.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a five-year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2016). Approximately 55% of the costs have been incurred through the end of fiscal 2013. Savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the corollary benefits achieved, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. Overall, the costs are expected to deliver in excess of $2 billion in before-tax annual savings. The cumulative before-tax savings realized as a result of restructuring costs incurred through 2013 were approximately $940 million. Restructuring accruals of $323 million as of June 30, 2013, are classified as current liabilities. Approximately 86% of the restructuring charges incurred during fiscal 2013 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. Refer to Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program. The Procter  Gamble Company   37  CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations. Operating Cash Flow Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Operating cash flow was $14.9 billion in 2013, a 12% increase from the prior year. Operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, deferred income taxes and gains on sale and purchase of businesses) and a decrease in working capital. Increased accounts receivable used $415 million of cash primarily to fund growth. In addition, accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased two days due to the timing and mix of sales late in the period and foreign exchange impacts. Increased inventory used $225 million of cash to support product initiatives and to build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes, partially offset by inventory management improvement efforts. Inventory days on hand increased by one day primarily due to foreign exchange impacts. Increased accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities generated $1.3 billion of cash primarily due to an increase in marketing accruals from increased advertising and other marketing costs. Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 Operating cash flow was $13.3 billion in 2012, in line with the prior year. Operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, deferred income taxes and gains on sale of businesses), partially offset by working capital increases. Increased accounts receivable used $427 million of cash to fund growth. However, accounts receivable days sales outstanding were down two days primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange. Inventory generated $77 million of cash, mainly due to an increase in inventory management improvement efforts, partially offset by inventory to support product initiatives and to build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes. Inventory days on hand declined by 10 days primarily due to inventory management improvement efforts and the impact of foreign exchange. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities used $22 million of cash, due primarily to the payment of fines related to violations of the European competition laws. Cash flow from discontinued operations contributed approximately $200 million to operating cash flow. Free Cash Flow. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Free cash flow was $10.9 billion in 2013, an increase of 17% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows. Free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings, was 95% in 2013. Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 Free cash flow was $9.3 billion in 2012, a decrease of 7% versus the prior year. Free cash flow decreased primarily due to higher capital spending to support geographic expansion. Free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings, was 85% in 2012. Investing Cash Flows Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Net investing activities consumed $6.3 billion in cash in 2013 mainly due to capital spending, cash paid for acquisitions and investments in available-for-sale securities, partially offset by asset sales. Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 Net investing activities consumed $1.1 billion in cash in 2012 mainly due to capital spending, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of $2.9 billion. These proceeds were primarily related to cash received from the sale of our snacks business in 2012. Capital Spending. We manage capital spending to support our business growth plans and have cost controls to deliver our cash generation targets. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $4.0 billion in both 2013 and 2012. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 4.8% in 2013. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points to 4.7% in 2012. Acquisitions. Acquisitions used $1.1 billion of cash in 2013 primarily for the acquisition of our partner's interest in a joint venture in Iberia. Acquisitions used $134 million of 38   The Procter  Gamble Company cash in 2012 primarily for the acquisition of New Chapter, a vitamins supplement business. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $584 million in cash in 2013 mainly due to the divestitures of our bleach business in Italy and the Braun household appliances business. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $2.9 billion to cash in 2012 mainly due to the sale of our snacks business. Financing Cash Flows Dividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 7% to $2.29 per share in 2013. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $6.5 billion in 2013 and $6.1 billion in 2012. In April 2013, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.5620 to $0.6015 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This represents a 7% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 57th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend in every year since our incorporation in 1890. Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $31.5 billion as of June 30, 2013 and $29.8 billion as of June 30, 2012. Our total debt increased in 2013 mainly due to debt issuances and an increase in commercial paper outstanding, partially offset by bond maturities. Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $6.0 billion in 2013 and $4.0 billion in 2012. Liquidity At June 30, 2013, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $6.0 billion, largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. Additionally, a portion of our cash is held off-shore by foreign subsidiaries. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the United States to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. On June 30, 2013, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard  Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings are Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard  Poor's), both with a stable outlook. We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $11.0 billion facility split between a $7.0 billion 5-year facility and a $4.0 billion 364-day facility, which expire in August 2018 and August 2014, respectively. The 364-day facility can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in, and in accordance with, the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain largely undrawn for the foreseeable future. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity.  The Procter  Gamble Company   39  Contractual Commitments The following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2013. ##TABLE_START ($ millions) Total  Less Than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  After 5 Years RECORDED LIABILITIES          Total debt $ 31,441  $ 12,393  $ 6,004  $ 2,609  $ 10,435 Capital leases      Uncertain tax positions (1)        OTHER          Interest payments relating to long-term debt 8,220   1,382  1,169  4,804 Operating leases (2) 1,512     Minimum pension funding (3)       Purchase obligations (4) 2,183  1,114    TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS 44,155  14,940  8,925  4,298  15,992 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  As of June 30, 2013, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $2.0 billion, including $447 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2013, cannot be made. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. These amounts do not include expected future discretionary contributions, including the July 2013 contribution to a foreign pension plan of approximately $1 billion. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2016 are not currently determinable. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing. Approximately 20% relates to service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position. ##TABLE_END SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include income taxes, certain employee benefits and acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of 40   The Procter  Gamble Company expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized. We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. For additional details on the Company's income taxes, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Employee Benefits We sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits. The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense, since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2013, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets were 7.3% and 8.3%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $100 million. Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans of 4.0% and 4.8%, respectively, represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100-basis point change in the pension discount rate would impact annual after-tax defined benefit pension expense by approximately $160 million. A change in the OPEB discount rate of 100 basis points would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $65 million. For additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets Our Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the transaction. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations The Procter  Gamble Company   41  and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are primarily based on these same factors. All of our acquired technology and customer-related intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives. The costs of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. We test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the book values of each asset to the estimated fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment test is performed and indefinite-lived brands may be adjusted to a determinable life. With the exception of our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses, all of our reporting units have fair values that significantly exceed recorded values. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year. The recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets from recently impaired businesses and recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and therefore are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge. For example, the Gillette intangible and goodwill amounts represent values as of a more recent acquisition date and, as such, the amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate. Gillette indefinite-lived intangible assets represent approximately 89% of the $26.8 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets at June 30, 2013. Goodwill allocated to stand-alone reporting units consisting primarily of businesses purchased as part of the Gillette acquisition represents 42% of the $55.2 billion of goodwill at June 30, 2013. This includes the Shave Care and Appliances businesses, which are components of the Grooming segment, and the Batteries business, which is part of the Fabric Care and Home Care segment. The results of our impairment testing during fiscal 2012 indicated that the estimated fair values of our Appliances and Salon Professional reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts. Therefore, we recorded a non-cash before- and after-tax impairment charge of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2012. Additionally, our impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets during fiscal 2012 indicated a decline in the fair value of our Koleston Perfect and Wella trade name intangible assets below their respective carrying values. This resulted in a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge of $246 million ($173 million after-tax) to reduce the carrying amounts of these assets to their estimated fair values. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the estimated fair value of our Appliances reporting units declined further, below the carrying amount resulting from the fiscal 2012 impairment. Therefore, we recorded an additional non-cash before and after-tax impairment charge of $259 million in fiscal 2013. Additionally, our fourth quarter 2013 impairment testing for Appliances indicated a decline in the fair value of our Braun trade name intangible asset below its carrying value. This resulted in a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge of $49 million ($31 million after-tax) to reduce the carrying amount of this asset to its estimated fair value. 42   The Procter  Gamble Company The Appliances business was acquired as part of the Gillette acquisition in 2005 and the Salon Professional business consists primarily of operations acquired in the Wella acquisition in 2004. Both businesses are stand-alone reporting units. These businesses represent some of our more discretionary consumer spending categories. Because of this, their operations and underlying fair values were disproportionately impacted by the economic downturn that began in fiscal 2009, which led to a reduction in home and personal grooming appliance purchases and in visits to hair salons that drove the fiscal 2012 impairment. The additional impairment of the Appliances business in fiscal 2013 was due to the devaluation of currency in Japan, a key country that generates a significant portion of the earnings of the Appliances business, relative to the currencies in which the underlying net assets are recorded. As of June 30, 2013, the Appliances business has remaining goodwill of $313 million, while the Salon Professional business has remaining goodwill of $424 million. As a result of the impairments, the estimated fair value of our Appliances business approximates its carrying value, while the estimated fair value of the Salon Professional business now slightly exceeds its carrying value. Our fiscal 2013 valuations of the Appliances and Salon Professional businesses has them returning to sales and earnings growth rates consistent with our long-term business plans. Failure to achieve these business plans or a further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions could result in a valuation that would trigger an additional impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses. New Accounting Pronouncements During fiscal 2013, the Company adopted ASU 2011-05, \"Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) - Presentation of Comprehensive Income\" (ASU 2011-05), and ASU 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) - Reporting of Amounts Reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2013-02). This guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders' equity and requires entities to present the components of net earnings and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. We chose to present net earnings and other comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance also requires entities to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income. We chose to present the requirements in the notes to the financial statements (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. OTHER INFORMATION Hedging and Derivative Financial Instruments As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. Except within financing operations, we leverage the Company's broadly diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments. Derivative positions can be monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the CorporateManager value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics dataset as of June 30, 2013. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics, a reasonable proxy is included. Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term. Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments. Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2013, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on The Procter  Gamble Company   43  historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements. Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with our financing operations, we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months. In addition, we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions. Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2013, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements. Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. In addition to fixed price contracts, we may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures. As of and during the year ended June 30, 2013, we did not have material commodity hedging activity. Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAP Our discussion of financial results includes several \"non-GAAP\" financial measures. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MDA, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. These measures include: Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:  ##TABLE_START Year ended June 30, 2013 Net Sales Growth  Foreign Exchange Impact  Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact*  Organic Sales Growth Beauty %  %  %  % Grooming %  %  %  % Health Care %  %  %  % Fabric Care and Home Care %  %  %  % Baby Care and Family Care %  %  %  % TOTAL COMPANY %  %  %  %         Year ended June 30, 2012 Net Sales Growth  Foreign Exchange Impact  Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact*  Organic Sales Growth Beauty %  %  %  % Grooming %  %  %  % Health Care %  %  %  % Fabric Care and Home Care %  %  %  % Baby Care and Family Care %  %  %  % TOTAL COMPANY %  %  %  % ##TABLE_END* Acquisition/Divestiture Impact includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. Core EPS. This is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. This includes a charge in 2013 for the balance sheet impact from the devaluation of the official foreign exchange rate in Venezuela, a holding gain in 2013 on the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture, impairment charges in 2013 and 2012 for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, charges in 2013 and 2012 related to incremental restructuring due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings, a significant benefit in 2011 from the settlement of U.S. tax litigation primarily related to the valuation of technology donations and charges in 2013, 2012 and 2011 related to pending European legal matters. We do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results. We believe the Core EPS measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year earnings per share growth. Core EPS is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. 44   The Procter  Gamble Company The table below provides a reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to Core EPS: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   Diluted net earnings per share - continuing operations $ 3.86  $ 3.12  $ 3.85 Venezuela balance sheet devaluation Impacts 0.08     Gain on purchase of balance of Iberian JV (0.21 )     Impairment charges 0.10  0.51   Incremental restructuring charges 0.18  0.20   Settlement from U.S. tax litigation     (0.08 ) Charges for pending European legal matters 0.05  0.03  0.10 Rounding (0.01 )  (0.01 )   CORE EPS 4.05  3.85  3.87 Core EPS Growth %  (1 )%   ##TABLE_ENDNote - All reconciling items are presented net of tax. Tax effects are calculated consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction. The significant adjustment to an income tax reserve was tax expense. There was no tax impact on EPS due to the charges for pending European legal matters. Free Cash Flow. Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Free Cash Flow Productivity. Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. Free cash flow productivity is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity ($ millions):  ##TABLE_START  Operating Cash Flow Capital Spending Free Cash Flow Net Earnings Free Cash Flow Productivity $ 14,873 $ (4,008 ) $ 10,865 $ 11,402 % 13,284 (3,964 ) 9,320 10,904 % 13,330 (3,306 ) 10,024 11,927 % ##TABLE_END", "7A": " Item 7A.

High-quality financial reporting is our responsibility, one we execute with integrity, and within both the letter and spirit of the law. High-quality financial reporting is characterized by accuracy, objectivity and transparency. Management is responsible for maintaining an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting to deliver those characteristics in all material respects. The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, provides oversight. We have engaged Deloitte  Touche LLP to audit our Consolidated Financial Statements, on which they have issued an unqualified opinion. Our commitment to providing timely, accurate and understandable information to investors encompasses: Communicating expectations to employees .

G. Lafley A. G. Lafley Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer /s/ Jon R. Moeller Jon R. Moeller Chief Financial Officer 46   The Procter  Gamble Company MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of The Procter  Gamble Company (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Strong internal controls is an objective that is reinforced through our Worldwide Business Conduct Manual , which sets forth our commitment to conduct business with integrity, and within both the letter and the spirit of the law. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes a Control Self-Assessment Program that is conducted annually for critical financial reporting areas of the Company and is audited by the internal audit function. Management takes the appropriate action to correct any identified control deficiencies. Because of its inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, may not prevent or detect misstatements due to the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden or that misstatements due to error or fraud may occur that are not detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2013 , using criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2013 , based on these criteria. Deloitte  Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2013 , as stated in their report which is included herein. /s/ A. G. Lafley A. G. Lafley Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer /s/ Jon R. Moeller Jon R. Moeller Chief Financial Officer August 8, 2013  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Procter  Gamble Company We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2013 and 2012 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Shareholders' Equity and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2013 . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2013 and 2012 , and the results of its operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2013 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted the new accounting guidance in ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) - Presentation of Comprehensive Income , and ASU 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) - Reporting of Amounts Reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income . We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2013 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 8, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP Cincinnati, Ohio August 8, 2013  The Procter  Gamble Company   47  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Procter  Gamble Company We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Procter  Gamble Company   53  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations The Procter  Gamble Company's (the \"Company,\" \"Procter  Gamble,\" \"we\" or \"us\") business is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through retail operations including mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons, high-frequency stores and e-commerce. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated. Use of Estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, consumer and trade promotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, post-employment benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets, uncertain income tax positions and contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although management does not generally believe such differences would materially affect the financial statements in any individual year. However, in regard to ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those anticipated at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that materially affect the financial statements in a given year. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned. Revenue transactions represent sales of inventory. The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. The revenue includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to the customer. Our policy is to recognize revenue when title to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period that the revenue is recognized. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred, generally at the time of the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in the accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacture of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product. Cost of products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense (SGA) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items. Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $2.0 billion in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include worldwide television, print, radio, internet and in-store advertising expenses and were $9.7 billion in 2013 , $9.3 billion in 2012 and $9.2 billion in 2011 . Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids, which are included in SGA, as well as coupons and customer trade funds, which are recorded as reductions to net sales. Other Non-Operating Income, Net Other non-operating income, net, primarily includes net acquisition and divestiture gains and investment income. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 54   The Procter  Gamble Company Currency Translation Financial statements of operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). Currency translation adjustments in accumulated OCI were a gain of $353 at June 30, 2013 and a loss of $357 at June 30, 2012 . For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Re-measurement adjustments for financial statements in highly inflationary economies and other transactional exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. Cash Flow Presentation The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method, which reconciles net earnings to cash flow from operating activities. The reconciliation adjustments include the removal of timing differences between the occurrence of operating receipts and payments and their recognition in net earnings. The adjustments also remove cash flows arising from investing and financing activities, which are presented separately from operating activities. Cash flows from foreign currency transactions and operations are translated at an average exchange rate for the period. Cash flows from hedging activities are included in the same category as the items being hedged. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as financing activities. Realized gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative instruments used to hedge currency exposures resulting from intercompany financing transactions are also classified as financing activities. Cash flows from other derivative instruments used to manage interest, commodity or other currency exposures are classified as operating activities. Cash payments related to income taxes are classified as operating activities. Cash flows from the Company's discontinued operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash Equivalents Highly liquid investments with remaining stated maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents and recorded at cost. Investments Investment securities consist of readily marketable debt and equity securities. Unrealized gains or losses for investments classified as trading are charged to earnings. Unrealized gains or losses on securities classified as available-for-sale are generally recorded in OCI. If an available-for-sale security is other than temporarily impaired, the loss is charged to either earnings or OCI depending on our intent and ability to retain the security until we recover the full cost basis and the extent of the loss attributable to the creditworthiness of the issuer. Investment securities are included as other current assets or other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Investments in certain companies over which we exert significant influence, but do not control the financial and operating decisions, are accounted for as equity method investments. Other investments that are not controlled, and over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method. Both equity and cost method investments are included as other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value. Product-related inventories are primarily maintained on the first-in, first-out method. Minor amounts of product inventories, including certain cosmetics and commodities, are maintained on the last-in, first-out method. The cost of spare part inventories is maintained using the average-cost method. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized over the assets' estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Machinery and equipment includes office furniture and fixtures (15-year life), computer equipment and capitalized software (3- to 5-year lives) and manufacturing equipment (3- to 20-year lives). Buildings are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 40 years. Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, when appropriate, changes are made prospectively. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. Our annual impairment testing of goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. The annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is based on valuation models that incorporate assumptions and internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans. We believe such assumptions are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. We have acquired brands that have been determined to have indefinite lives. We evaluate a number of factors to determine whether an indefinite life is appropriate, including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company   55  indefinite-lived brands may be adjusted to a determinable life. The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology and other intangible assets with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives. Customer relationships, brands and other non-contractual intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over periods generally ranging from 5 to 30 years. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and remaining lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted. Fair Values of Financial Instruments Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Changes in assumptions or estimation methods could affect the fair value estimates; however, we do not believe any such changes would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, other investments and short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair values of long-term debt and financial instruments are disclosed in Note 5. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies Other than as described below, no new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2013, the Company adopted ASU 2011-05, \"Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) - Presentation of Comprehensive Income\", and ASU 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) - Reporting of Amounts Reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This guidance eliminates the option to present the components of OCI as part of the statement of shareholders' equity and requires entities to present the components of net earnings and OCI in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements. We chose to present net earnings and OCI in two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance also requires entities to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) by component and to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI by the respective line items of net income. We chose to present the requirements in the notes to the financial statements (see Note 6). The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. NOTE 2 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS The change in the net carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment was as follows: ##TABLE_START  Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby Care and Family Care Corporate Total Company GOODWILL at JUNE 30, 2011 - Gross $ 18,039 $ 22,650 $ 8,179 $ 6,735 $ 1,553 $ $ 57,562 Accumulated impairment losses at June 30, 2011        GOODWILL at JUNE 30, 2011 - Net 18,039 22,650 8,179 6,735 1,553 57,562 Acquisitions and divestitures (3 ) (12 ) 34  (92 ) Goodwill impairment charges (431 ) (899 )     (1,330 ) Translation and other (1,176 ) (1,059 ) (314 ) (212 ) (94 ) (5 ) (2,860 ) GOODWILL at JUNE 30, 2012 - Gross 16,860 21,579 8,339 6,557 1,459 55,103 Accumulated impairment losses at June 30, 2012 (431 ) (899 )     (1,330 ) GOODWILL at JUNE 30, 2012 - Net 16,429 20,680 8,339 6,557 1,459 53,773 Acquisitions and divestitures (21 ) (40 ) (11 )  1,015 Goodwill impairment charges  (259 )     (259 ) Translation and other 236 40  GOODWILL at JUNE 30, 2013 - Gross 17,094 21,775 9,059 6,586 1,954 56,777 Accumulated impairment losses at June 30, 2013 (431 ) (1,158 )     (1,589 ) GOODWILL at JUNE 30, 2013 - Net 16,663 20,617 9,059 6,586 1,954 55,188 ##TABLE_ENDAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 56   The Procter  Gamble Company In October 2012, the Company acquired our partner's interest in a joint venture in Iberia that operates in our Baby Care and Family Care and Health Care reportable segments. We paid $1.1 billion for our partner's interest and the transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The total enterprise value of $1.9 billion was allocated to indefinite-lived intangible assets of $0.2 billion , defined-life intangible assets of $0.9 billion and goodwill of $1.1 billion . These were partially offset by $0.3 billion of deferred tax liabilities on the intangible assets. The Company recognized a $0.6 billion holding gain on its previously held investment, which was included in other non-operating income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in fiscal 2013. In addition to these items and the impairment discussed below, the remaining net increase in goodwill since June 30, 2012 was primarily due to currency translation across all reportable segments. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the estimated fair value of our Appliances reporting unit declined below its carrying amount. As a result, we recorded a non-cash before and after-tax impairment charge of $259 in fiscal 2013 to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to estimated fair value. The same factors that led to the decline in the fair value of the reporting unit led to a decline in the fair value of our Braun trade name intangible asset below its respective carrying value. This resulted in a non-cash before-tax impairment charge of $49 ( $31 after-tax) to reduce the carrying amount of this asset to its fair value. The results of our goodwill impairment testing during fiscal 2012 determined that the estimated fair values of our Appliances and Salon Professional reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts. As a result, we recorded a non-cash before and after-tax impairment charge of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2012 to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to estimated fair value; $899 of the impairment related to Appliances and $431 related to Salon Professional. Our impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets during fiscal 2012 also indicated a decline in the fair value of our Koleston Perfect and Wella trade name intangible assets below their respective carrying values. This resulted in a non-cash before-tax impairment charge of $246 ( $173 after-tax) to reduce the carrying amounts of these assets to their respective fair values. All of the fiscal 2013 and 2012 goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges are included in Corporate for segment reporting. The goodwill and intangible asset valuations are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those used in our valuations. To the extent such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows used to estimate fair value, we may need to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future. The fiscal 2013 declines in fair values of the Appliances reporting unit and the Braun trade name intangible asset were primarily driven by currency impacts. Specifically, currency in Japan, a country that generates a significant portion of the Appliances earnings, devalued approximately 20% in the second half of fiscal 2013 relative to the currencies in which the underlying net assets are recorded. This sustained reduction in the yen reduced the underlying category market size and the projected future cash flows of the business, which in turn triggered the impairment. The fiscal 2012 declines in the fair values of the Appliances and Salon Professional reporting units and the underlying Koleston Perfect and Wella trade name intangible assets were driven by a combination of similar competitive and economic factors, which resulted in a reduction in the forecasted growth rates and cash flows used to estimate fair value. The factors included: (1) a more prolonged and deeper deterioration of the macroeconomic environment than was previously expected which, due to the more discretionary nature of the Appliances and Salon Professional businesses, led to a reduction in the overall market size in the short term and a more significant and prolonged reduction in the expected underlying market growth rates and resulting sales levels in the longer term. This was particularly evident in Europe, where we have historically generated a majority of the Appliances and Salon Professional sales; (2) increasing competitive levels of innovation in Salon Professional, which negatively impacted our current and nearer-term projected market share progress; and, (3) an increasing level of competitive pricing activities, which negatively impacted overall category profitability. As a result of these factors, we reduced our current and long-term sales and earnings forecasts for these businesses.

Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually. In February and November 2012, the Company made announcements regarding an incremental restructuring program as part of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The productivity and cost savings plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the Company's growth strategy. The Company expects to incur in excess of $3.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a five year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2016), including costs incurred as part of the ongoing and incremental restructuring program. The Company has incurred approximately 55% of the costs under this plan as of the end of fiscal 2013, with the remainder expected to be incurred in fiscal years 2014 through 2016. The restructuring program is being executed across the Company's centralized organization as well as across virtually all of its Market Development Organizations (MDO) and Global Business Units (GBU). The restructuring program plans included an initial targeted net reduction in non-manufacturing overhead enrollment of Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 58   The Procter  Gamble Company approximately 5,700 by the end of fiscal 2013. Through fiscal 2013, the Company has reduced non-manufacturing enrollment by approximately 7,000 , which is 1,300 positions above the initial target. In addition to the reduction of 5,700 employees, the restructuring program includes plans for a further non-manufacturing overhead personnel reduction of approximately 2% - 4% annually from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2016, roughly doubling the size of the initial enrollment reduction target. This is being done via the elimination of duplicate work, simplification through the use of technology and the optimization of various functional and business organizations and the Company's global footprint. In addition, the plan includes integration of newly acquired companies and the optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees and asset-related costs to exit facilities. The Company is also incurring other types of costs as outlined below. The Company incurred total restructuring charges of approximately $ 956 million and $ 1.1 billion for the years ended June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012, respectively. Approximately $ 600 and $ 746 of these charges were recorded in SGA for the years ended June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012, respectively. The remainder is included in cost of products sold. Since the inception of this restructuring program, the Company has incurred charges of approximately $ 2.0 billion . Approximately $ 1.1 billion of these charges were related to separations, $ 487 million were asset-related and $ 431 million were related to other restructuring-type costs. The following table presents restructuring activity for the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012: ##TABLE_START  Separations  Asset-Related Costs  Other  Total RESERVE JUNE 30, 2011 $  $   $  $         Charges    1,052 Cash spent (300 )    (182 )  (482 ) Charges against assets   (378 )    (378 ) RESERVE JUNE 30, 2012             Charges    Cash spent (615 )    (252 )  (867 ) Charges against assets   (109 )    (109 ) RESERVE JUNE 30, 2013     ##TABLE_ENDSeparation Costs Employee separation charges for the years ended June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012 relate to severance packages for approximately 3,450 and 3,300 employees, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012, these severance packages include approximately 2,390 and 2,250 non-manufacturing employees, respectively. These separations are primarily in North America and Western Europe. The packages are predominantly voluntary and the amounts are calculated based on salary levels and past service periods. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Since its inception, the restructuring program has incurred separation charges related to approximately 6,750 employees, of which approximately 4,640 are non-manufacturing overhead personnel. Asset-Related Costs Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal. These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardization. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other Costs Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program. Such charges primarily include employee relocation related to separations and office consolidations, termination of contracts related to supply chain redesign and the cost to change internal systems and processes to support the underlying organizational changes. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges are funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting. Accordingly, 100% of the charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment.

NOTE 5 RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. To the extent we choose to manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions that we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. At inception, we formally designate and document qualifying instruments as hedges of underlying exposures. We formally assess, at inception and at least quarterly, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. Fluctuations in the value of these instruments generally are offset by changes in the value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. This is driven by the high degree of effectiveness between the exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument. The ineffective portion of a change in the fair value of a qualifying instrument is immediately recognized in earnings. The amount of ineffectiveness recognized was immaterial for all years presented. Credit Risk Management We have counterparty credit guidelines and normally enter into transactions with investment grade financial institutions. Counterparty exposures are monitored daily and downgrades in counterparty credit ratings are reviewed on a timely basis. We have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, material credit losses on our risk management or other financial instruments. Certain of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 60   The Procter  Gamble Company arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position as of June 30, 2013 , was not material. The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features. Interest Rate Risk Management Our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. To manage this risk in a cost-efficient manner, we enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to exchange with the counterparty, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional amount. Interest rate swaps that meet specific accounting criteria are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in interest expense. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument is reported in OCI and reclassified into interest expense over the life of the underlying debt obligation. The ineffective portion for both cash flow and fair value hedges, which was not material for any year presented, was immediately recognized in interest expense. Foreign Currency Risk Management We manufacture and sell our products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world. As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To manage the exchange rate risk primarily associated with our financing operations, we have historically used a combination of forward contracts, options and currency swaps. As of June 30, 2013 , we had currency swaps with maturities up to five years, which are intended to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in OCI and reclassified into SGA and interest expense in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion, which was not material for any year presented, was immediately recognized in SGA. The change in fair values of certain non-qualifying instruments used to manage foreign exchange exposure of intercompany financing transactions and certain balance sheet items subject to revaluation are immediately recognized in earnings, substantially offsetting the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposures. Net Investment Hedging We hedge certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries. To accomplish this, we either borrow directly in foreign currencies and designate all or a portion of the foreign currency debt as a hedge of the applicable net investment position or we enter into foreign currency swaps that are designated as hedges of net investments. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in OCI to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. Currency effects of these hedges reflected in OCI were after-tax gains of $156 and $740 in 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Accumulated net balances were after-tax losses of $3,550 and $3,706 as of June 30, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The ineffective portion, which was not material in any year presented, was immediately recognized in interest expense. Commodity Risk Management Certain raw materials used in our products or production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. To manage the volatility related to anticipated purchases of certain of these materials, we have historically, on a limited basis, used futures and options with maturities generally less than one year and swap contracts with maturities up to five years. As of and during the year ended June 30, 2013, we did not have material commodity hedging activity. Insurance We self-insure for most insurable risks. However, we purchase insurance for Directors and Officers Liability and certain other coverage where it is required by law, by contract or deemed to be in the best interest of the Company. Fair Value Hierarchy Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets. When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets or liabilities during the year. Our fair value estimates take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and our counterparties. When active market quotes are not available for financial assets and liabilities, we use industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company   61  using market-based observable inputs including credit risk, interest rate curves, foreign currency rates and forward and spot prices for currencies. In circumstances where market-based observable inputs are not available, management judgment is used to develop assumptions to estimate fair value. Generally, the fair value of our Level 3 instruments is estimated as the net present value of expected future cash flows based on external inputs. The following table sets forth the Company's financial assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2013 and 2012 that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total June 30        ASSETS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE                Investments:                U.S. government securities $   $   $ 1,571  $   $   $   $ 1,571  $  Other investments          Derivatives relating to:                Foreign currency hedges              Other foreign currency instruments (1)            Interest rates            Net investment hedges            Commodities              TOTAL ASSETS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE (2)   2,182     2,229           LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE                Derivatives relating to:                Foreign currency hedges $   $   $   $  $   $   $   $ Other foreign currency instruments (1)            Interest rates              Net investment hedges              Commodities              TOTAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE (3)            LIABILITIES NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE                Long-term debt (4) 22,671  25,829  3,022  2,119      25,693  27,948 TOTAL LIABILITIES RECORDED AND NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE 22,671  25,829  3,171  2,305      25,842  28,134 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Other foreign currency instruments are comprised of foreign currency financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Investment securities and all derivative assets are presented in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other noncurrent assets. The amortized cost of the U.S. government securities was $1,604 as of June 30, 2013. All U.S. government securities have contractual maturities between one and five years. Fair values are generally estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  All liabilities are presented in accrued and other liabilities or other noncurrent liabilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Long-term debt includes the current portion ( $4,540 and $4,095 as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively) of debt instruments.

Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. ##TABLE_END The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. During fiscal 2013, the Company transferred long-term debt instruments with a fair value of $455 from Level 1 to Level 2. The transferred instruments represent the Company's investment in industrial development bonds which are infrequently traded in an observable market. There were no additional transfers between levels during the periods presented. In addition, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 62   The Procter  Gamble Company During fiscal 2013 and 2012, we recorded impairments of certain goodwill and intangible assets. Also, during fiscal 2013, we applied purchase accounting and re-measured assets and liabilities at fair value related to the purchase of the balance of a joint venture in Iberia (see Note 2 for additional details on these items). In addition, the Company re-measured certain operating real estate assets to an estimated fair value of $8 during the year ended June 30, 2012, using comparable prices for similar assets, resulting in a $220 impairment. Except for these items, there were no significant assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years presented.

Key managers can elect to receive up to 100% of the value of their option award in RSUs. Key manager RSUs vest and are settled in shares of common stock five years from the grant date. The awards provided to the Company's directors are in the form of restricted stock and RSUs. In addition to our key manager and director grants, we make other minor stock option and RSU grants to employees for which the terms are not substantially different than those described in the preceding paragraph. In 2011, we implemented a performance stock program (PSP) and granted PSUs to senior level executives. Under this program, the number of PSUs that will vest three years after the respective grant date is based on the Company's performance relative to pre-established performance goals during that three year period. A total of 180 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under stock-based compensation plans approved by shareholders in 2003 and 2009. A total of 56 million shares remain available for grant under the 2003 and 2009 plans. Total stock-based compensation expense for stock option grants was $249 , $317 and $358 for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Total compensation expense for restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs was $97 , $60 and $56 in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for stock options, restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs was $96 , $102 and $117 in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. In calculating the compensation expense for stock options granted, we utilize a binomial lattice-based valuation model.

The Procter  Gamble Company   65  Assumptions utilized in the model, which are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and experience, were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   Interest rate 0.2-2.0%  0.2-2.1%  0.3-3.7% Weighted average interest rate 1.8 %  1.9 %  3.4 % Dividend yield 2.9 %  2.6 %  2.4 % Expected volatility 14-15%  12-18%  14-18% Weighted average volatility %  %  % Expected life in years 8.9  8.5  8.8 ##TABLE_ENDLattice-based option valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs and those ranges are disclosed in the preceding table. Expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatilities of call options on our stock. We use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination patterns within the valuation model. The expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. A summary of options, RSUs and PSUs outstanding under the plans as of June 30, 2013 , and activity during the year then ended is presented below: ##TABLE_START Options in thousands Options Weighted Avg.

The total grant-date fair value of options that vested during 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $352 , $435 and $445 , respectively. At June 30, 2013 , there was $233 of compensation cost that has not yet been recognized related to stock option grants. That cost is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 1.8 years. Cash received from options exercised was $3,294 , $1,735 and $1,237 in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises totaled $575 , $239 and $188 in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. ##TABLE_START  RSUs  PSUs Other Stock-Based Awards in thousands Units  Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value  Units  Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Non-vested at July 1, 2012 3,670  $ 55.53  1,261  $ 58.79 Granted 1,951  62.69   67.70 Vested (952 )  59.50     Forfeited (79 )  55.31     Non-vested at June 30, 2013 4,590  56.88  1,887  61.75 ##TABLE_ENDAt June 30, 2013 , there was $195 of compensation cost that has not yet been recognized related to restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs.

We have no specific policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options, RSUs and PSUs. However, we have historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash availability, market trends and other factors, to offset the impacts of such activity. NOTE 9 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN We offer various postretirement benefits to our employees. Defined Contribution Retirement Plans We have defined contribution plans which cover the majority of our U.S. employees, as well as employees in certain other countries. These plans are fully funded. We generally make contributions to participants' accounts based on individual base salaries and years of service. Total global defined contribution expense was $314 , $353 and $347 in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The primary U.S. defined contribution plan (the U.S. DC plan) comprises the majority of the expense for the Company's defined contribution plans. For the U.S. DC plan, the contribution rate is set annually. Total contributions for this plan approximated 15% of total participants' annual wages and salaries in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . We maintain The Procter  Gamble Profit Sharing Trust (Trust) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) to provide a portion of the funding for the U.S. DC plan and other retiree benefits (described below). Operating details of the ESOP are provided at the end of this Note. The fair value of the ESOP Series A shares allocated to participants Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 66   The Procter  Gamble Company reduces our cash contribution required to fund the U.S. DC plan. Defined Benefit Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits We offer defined benefit retirement pension plans to certain employees. These benefits relate primarily to local plans outside the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, plans assumed in previous acquisitions covering U.S. employees. We also provide certain other retiree benefits, primarily health care and life insurance, for the majority of our U.S. employees who become eligible for these benefits when they meet minimum age and service requirements. Generally, the health care plans require cost sharing with retirees and pay a stated percentage of expenses, reduced by deductibles and other coverages. These benefits are primarily funded by ESOP Series B shares and certain other assets contributed by the Company. Obligation and Funded Status . The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of these defined benefit plans: ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits (1)  Other Retiree Benefits (2) Years ended June 30    CHANGE IN BENEFIT OBLIGATION        Benefit obligation at beginning of year (3) $ 13,573  $ 12,229  $ 6,006  $ 4,886 Service cost    Interest cost    Participants' contributions    Amendments  (44 )     Actuarial loss/(gain)  1,911  (1,022 )  Acquisitions/(divestitures)  (17 )     Special termination benefits     Currency translation and other (4 )  (847 )   (95 ) Benefit payments (602 )  (559 )  (234 )  (255 ) BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT END OF YEAR (3) 14,514  13,573  5,289  6,006 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START CHANGE IN PLAN ASSETS        Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 7,974  7,962  2,713  2,975 Actual return on plan assets    (126 ) Acquisitions/(divestitures)       Employer contributions    Participants' contributions    Currency translation and other (77 )  (395 )     ESOP debt impacts (4)      Benefit payments (602 )  (559 )  (234 )  (255 ) FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AT END OF YEAR 8,561  7,974  3,553  2,713 FUNDED STATUS (5,953 )  (5,599 )  (1,736 )  (3,293 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Primarily non-U.S.-based defined benefit retirement plans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Primarily U.S.-based other postretirement benefit plans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  For the pension benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation.

The Procter  Gamble Company   69  Several factors are considered in developing the estimate for the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets. For the defined benefit retirement plans, these factors include historical rates of return of broad equity and bond indices and projected long-term rates of return obtained from pension investment consultants. The expected long-term rates of return for plan assets are 8 - 9% for equities and 5 - 6% for bonds. For other retiree benefit plans, the expected long-term rate of return reflects the fact that the assets are comprised primarily of Company stock. The expected rate of return on Company stock is based on the long-term projected return of 8.5% and reflects the historical pattern of returns. Assumed health care cost trend rates could have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other retiree benefit plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: ##TABLE_START  One-Percentage Point Increase  One-Percentage Point Decrease Effect on the total service and interest cost components $  $ (70 ) Effect on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation  (643 ) ##TABLE_ENDPlan Assets . Our investment objective for defined benefit retirement plan assets is to meet the plans' benefit obligations, while minimizing the potential for future required Company plan contributions. The investment strategies focus on asset class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit payments and an appropriate balance of long-term investment return and risk. Target ranges for asset allocations are determined by matching the actuarial projections of the plans' future liabilities and benefit payments with expected long-term rates of return on the assets, taking into account investment return volatility and correlations across asset classes. Plan assets are diversified across several investment managers and are generally invested in liquid funds that are selected to track broad market equity and bond indices. Investment risk is carefully controlled with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and with continual monitoring of investment managers' performance relative to the investment guidelines established with each investment manager. Our target asset allocation for the year ended June 30, 2013 , and actual asset allocation by asset category as of June 30, 2013 and 2012 , were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Target Asset Allocation  Actual Asset Allocation at June 30      Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits Asset Category Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits     Cash %  %  %  %  %  % Debt securities %  %  %  %  %  % Equity securities %  %  %  %  %  % TOTAL %  %  %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDThe following tables set forth the fair value of the Company's plan assets as of June 30, 2013 and 2012 segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy (refer to Note 5 for further discussion on the fair value hierarchy and fair value principles). Common collective funds are valued using the net asset value reported by the managers of the funds and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. Company stock listed as Level 2 in the hierarchy represents preferred shares which are valued based on the value of Company common stock. The majority of our Level 3 pension instruments are insurance contracts. Their fair values are based on their cash equivalent or models that project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate curves. ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total June 30        ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE                Cash and cash equivalents $  $  $   $   $   $   $  $ Common collective fund - equity     3,993  3,727      3,993  3,727 Common collective fund - fixed income     4,361  4,112      4,361  4,112 Other          TOTAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE   8,354  7,839    8,561  7,974 ##TABLE_ENDAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 70   The Procter  Gamble Company ##TABLE_START  Other Retiree Benefits  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total June 30        ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE                Cash and cash equivalents $  $  $   $   $   $   $  $ Company stock     3,270  2,418      3,270  2,418 Common collective fund - equity            Common collective fund - fixed income            Other            TOTAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE   3,486  2,695    3,553  2,713 ##TABLE_ENDThere was no significant activity within the Level 3 pension and other retiree benefits plan assets during the years presented. Cash Flows . Management's best estimate of cash requirements and discretionary contributions for the defined benefit retirement plans and other retiree benefit plans for the year ending June 30, 2014, is approximately $1,463 and $31 , respectively. For the defined benefit retirement plans, this is comprised of $90 in expected benefit payments from the Company directly to participants of unfunded plans and $1,373 of expected contributions to funded plans. This estimate includes a discretionary contribution made to a foreign pension plan for approximately $1.0 billion in July 2013. For other retiree benefit plans, this is comprised of expected contributions that will be used directly for benefit payments. Expected contributions are dependent on many variables, including the variability of the market value of the plan assets as compared to the benefit obligation and other market or regulatory conditions. In addition, we take into consideration our business investment opportunities and resulting cash requirements. Accordingly, actual funding may differ significantly from current estimates. Total benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which include payments funded from the Company's assets, as discussed above, as well as payments from the plans, are as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ending June 30 Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS $  $ 2015  2016  2017  2018  2019 - 2023 3,392  1,549 ##TABLE_ENDEmployee Stock Ownership Plan We maintain the ESOP to provide funding for certain employee benefits discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The ESOP borrowed $1.0 billion in 1989 and the proceeds were used to purchase Series A ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the U.S. DC plan. Principal and interest requirements of the borrowing were paid by the Trust from dividends on the preferred shares and from advances provided by the Company. The original borrowing of $1.0 billion has been repaid in full, and advances from the Company of $112 remain outstanding at June 30, 2013 . Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock. The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $2.29 per share. The liquidation value is $6.82 per share. In 1991, the ESOP borrowed an additional $1.0 billion . The proceeds were used to purchase Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of retiree health care benefits. These shares, net of the ESOP's debt, are considered plan assets of the other retiree benefits plan discussed above. Debt service requirements are funded by preferred stock dividends, cash contributions and advances provided by the Company, of which $539 is outstanding at June 30, 2013 . Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock. The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $2.29 per share. The liquidation value is $12.96 per share. Our ESOP accounting practices are consistent with current ESOP accounting guidance, including the permissible continuation of certain provisions from prior accounting guidance. ESOP debt, which is guaranteed by the Company, is recorded as debt (see Note 4) with an offset to the reserve for ESOP debt retirement, which is presented within shareholders' equity. Advances to the ESOP by the Company are recorded as an increase in the reserve for ESOP debt retirement. Interest incurred on the ESOP debt is recorded as interest expense. Dividends on all preferred shares, net of related tax benefits, are charged to retained earnings. The series A and B preferred shares of the ESOP are allocated to employees based on debt service requirements, net of advances made by the Company to the Trust.

NOTE 10 INCOME TAXES Income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current year and for the impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which represent future tax consequences of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using the enacted statutory tax rates and are adjusted for any changes in such rates in the period of change.

Tax costs charged to shareholders' equity totaled $503 for the year ended June 30, 2013 . This primarily relates to the impact of certain adjustments to pension obligations recorded in shareholders' equity, partially offset by excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Tax benefits credited to shareholders' equity totaled $661 for the year ended June 30, 2012. These primarily relate to the tax effects of net investment hedges, excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and the impacts of certain adjustments to pension and other retiree benefit obligations recorded in shareholders' equity. We have undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $42.0 billion at June 30, 2013 , for which deferred taxes have not been provided. Such earnings are considered indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiaries. If such earnings were repatriated, additional tax expense may result. However, the calculation of the amount of deferred U.S. income tax on these earnings is not practicable because of the large number of assumptions necessary to compute the tax.

We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statute of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. The Company is making a concerted effort to bring its audit inventory to a more current position. We have done this by working with tax authorities to conduct audits for several open years at once. We have tax years open ranging from 2002 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit. While we do not expect material changes, it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to our uncertain tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months related to the audits described above. At this time, we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of uncertain tax positions or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items. Included in the total liability for uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2013 , is $1.2 billion that, depending on the ultimate resolution, could impact the effective tax rate in future periods. Accounting pronouncements require that, without discretion, we recognize the additional accrual of any possible related interest and penalties relating to the underlying uncertain tax position in income tax expense, unless the Company qualifies for a specific exception. As of June 30, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , we had accrued interest of $413 , $439 and $475 and accrued penalties of $34 , $66 and $80 , respectively, that are not included in the above table. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , we recognized $24 , $2  and $197 in interest benefit and $32 , $10 and $16 in penalties benefit, respectively. The net benefits recognized resulted primarily from the favorable resolution of tax positions for prior years. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities were comprised of the following: ##TABLE_START June 30  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS    Pension and postretirement benefits $ 1,777  $ 2,366 Stock-based compensation 1,125  1,304 Loss and other carryforwards 1,062  Goodwill and other intangible assets  Accrued marketing and promotion  Fixed assets  Unrealized loss on financial and foreign exchange transactions  Accrued interest and taxes  Inventory  Other  Valuation allowances (341 )  (375 ) TOTAL 5,367  5,839    DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES    Goodwill and other intangible assets $ 11,941  $ 11,816 Fixed assets 1,718  1,719 Other  TOTAL 13,974  13,821 ##TABLE_ENDNet operating loss carryforwards were $3.1 billion and $2.8 billion at June 30, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. If unused, $1.4 billion will expire between 2014 and 2033. The remainder, totaling $1.7 billion at June 30, 2013 , may be carried forward indefinitely. NOTE 11 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Guarantees In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may provide routine indemnifications (e.g., indemnification for representations and warranties and retention of previously existing environmental, tax and employee liabilities) for which terms range in duration and, in some circumstances, are not explicitly defined. The maximum obligation under some indemnifications is also not explicitly stated and, as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss on any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company   73  In certain situations, we guarantee loans for suppliers and customers. The total amount of guarantees issued under such arrangements is not material. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that have a material impact on our financial statements. Purchase Commitments and Operating Leases We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations are as follows:  ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30      Thereafter Purchase obligations $ 1,114  $  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDSuch amounts represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing. Approximately 20% of our purchase commitments relate to service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced to third-party suppliers. Due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination. We do not expect to incur penalty payments under these provisions that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We also lease certain property and equipment for varying periods. Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases, net of guaranteed sublease income, are as follows:  ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30      Thereafter Operating leases $  $  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDLitigation We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters such as antitrust, trade and other governmental regulations, product liability, patent and trademark matters, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, labor and employments matters and income and other taxes. As previously disclosed, the Company has had a number of antitrust matters in Europe. These matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. Several regulatory authorities in Europe have issued separate decisions pursuant to their investigations alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in those countries. The Company has accrued the assessed fines for each of the decisions, of which all but $16 has been paid as of June 30, 2013. Some of those are on appeal. As a result of our initial and on-going analyses of other formal complaints, the Company has accrued liabilities for competition law violations totaling $139 as of June 30, 2013. While the ultimate resolution of these matters may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts reserved, we do not expect any such incremental losses to materially impact our financial statements in the period in which they are accrued and paid, respectively. With respect to other litigation and claims, while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. NOTE 12 SEGMENT INFORMATION Under U.S. GAAP, the GBUs (Categories) are aggregated into five reportable segments: ##TABLE_START  Beauty : Beauty Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Cosmetics, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); Hair Care and Color; Prestige (SKII, fragrances); Salon Professional; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Grooming : Shave Care (Blades and Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products); Braun and Appliances; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Health Care : Feminine Care (Feminine Care, Incontinence); Oral Care (Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Other Personal Health Care, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fabric Care and Home Care : Fabric Care (Bleach and Laundry Additives, Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, Surface Care); Personal Power (Batteries); Pet Care; Professional; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Baby Care and Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper). ##TABLE_END The accounting policies of the businesses are generally the same as those described in Note 1. Differences between these policies and U.S. GAAP primarily reflect income taxes, which are reflected in the businesses using applicable blended statutory rates, and the treatment of certain unconsolidated investees. Certain unconsolidated investees are managed as integral parts of our businesses for Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 74   The Procter  Gamble Company management reporting purposes. Accordingly, these partially owned operations are reflected as consolidated subsidiaries in segment results, with full recognition of the individual income statement line items through before-tax earnings. Eliminations to adjust these line items to U.S. GAAP are included in Corporate. In determining after-tax earnings for the businesses, we eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest, and apply statutory tax rates. Adjustments to arrive at our effective tax rate are also included in Corporate. Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities that are not reflected in the operating results used internally to measure and evaluate the businesses, as well as eliminations to adjust management reporting principles to U.S. GAAP. Operating activities in Corporate include the results of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level along with the elimination of individual revenues and expenses generated by certain unconsolidated investees, discussed in the preceding paragraph, over which we exert significant influence, but do not control. Operating elements also include certain employee benefit costs, the costs of certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization and other general Corporate items. The non-operating elements in Corporate primarily include interest expense, acquisition and divestiture gains and interest and investing income. In addition, Corporate includes the historical results of certain divested businesses. Total assets for the reportable segments include those assets managed by the reportable segment, primarily inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets. Other assets, primarily including cash, accounts receivable, investment securities and goodwill, are included in Corporate. Our business units are comprised of similar product categories. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, nine business units individually accounted for 5% or more of consolidated net sales as follows: ##TABLE_START  % of Sales by Business Unit Years ended June 30   Fabric Care 20%  20%  20% Baby Care 13%  13%  12% Hair Care and Color 11%  11%  11% Shave Care 8%  9%  9% Beauty Care 7%  7%  7% Home Care 7%  7%  7% Family Care 7%  6%  7% Oral Care 6%  6%  6% Feminine Care 6%  6%  6% All Other 15%  15%  15% Total 100%  100%  100% ##TABLE_ENDThe Company had net sales in the U.S. of $30.3 billion , $29.5 billion and $29.9 billion for the years ended June 30, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.

This plan was approved by the Company's Board of Directors on February 14, 1997. Although the plan has not been submitted to shareholders for approval, it is nearly identical to The Procter  Gamble 1992 Stock Plan, approved by the Company's shareholders on October 13, 1992, except for a few minor changes designed to comply with the Belgian tax laws. The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate key Belgian employees. Under the plan, eligible participants were: (i) granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii) granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii) granted shares of the Company's common stock. Except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights must vest in no less than one year from the date of grant and must expire no later than fifteen years from the date of grant. The exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan is the average price of the Company's stock on the date of grant. If a recipient of a grant leaves the Company while holding an unexercised option or right, any unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, and any exercisable portions become void within one month of departure, except in the case of death or retirement. Any common stock awarded under the plan may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the committee administering the plan may determine. The Procter  Gamble Future Shares Plan On October 14, 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved The Procter  Gamble Future Shares Plan pursuant to which options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock may be granted to employees worldwide. The purpose of this plan is to advance the interests of the Company by giving substantially all employees a stake in the Company's future growth and success and to strengthen the alignment of interests between employees and the Company's shareholders through increased ownership of shares of the Company's stock. The plan has not been submitted to shareholders for approval. Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company's capitalization, the number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 17 million shares. Under the plan's regulations, recipients are granted options to acquire 100 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price equal to the average price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant. These options vest five years after the date of grant and expire ten years following the date of grant. If a recipient leaves the employ of the Company prior to the vesting date for a reason other than disability, retirement or special separation (as defined in the plan), then the award is forfeited. At the time of the first grant following Board approval of the plan, each employee of the Company not eligible for an award under the 1992 Stock Plan was granted options for 100 shares. From the date of this first grant through June 30, 2003, each new employee of the Company has also received options for 100 shares. Following the grant of options on June 30, 2003, the Company suspended this part of the plan. The plan terminated on October 13, 2007. The Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan Shareholders of The Gillette Company approved The Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan on May 20, 2004, and the plan was assumed by the Company upon the merger between The Procter  Gamble Company and The Gillette Company. All options became immediately vested and exercisable on October 1, 2005 as a result of the merger. After the merger, all outstanding options became options to purchase shares of The Procter  Gamble Company subject to an exchange ratio of .975 shares of PG stock per share of Gillette stock. Only employees previously employed by The Gillette Company prior to October 1, 2005 are eligible to receive grants under this plan. The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate employees of The Gillette Company, and until the effective date of the merger between The Gillette Company and The Procter  Gamble Company, non-employee members of the Gillette Board of Directors. Under the plan, eligible participants are: (i) granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii) granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii) granted shares of the Company's common stock or restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents). Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company's capitalization and the addition of any shares authorized but not issued or redeemed under The Gillette Company 1971 Stock Option Plan, the number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 19,000,000 shares. Except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights must expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan must be equal to or greater than the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of grant. Any common stock awarded under the plan may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the committee administering the plan may determine.  If a recipient of a grant leaves the Company while holding an unexercised option or right: (1) any unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement, special separation (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has waived the termination provisions; and (2) any exercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of 80   The Procter  Gamble Company death, retirement, special separation, voluntary resignation that is not for Good Reason (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has waived the termination provisions.

The Company's annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains these reports at: www.sec.gov. You can also access these reports through links from our website at: www.pg.com/investors. Copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting Computershare Inc., 250 Royall Street, Canton, MA 02021. Financial Information about Segments As of June 30, 2014, the Company has five reportable segments under U.S. GAAP: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby, Feminine and Family Care. Many of the factors necessary for understanding these businesses are similar. Operating margins of the individual businesses vary due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products, the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. Net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets and product categories in which they operate. While none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components within certain reportable segments, such as Batteries (Fabric Care and Home Care), Appliances (Grooming) and Prestige Fragrances (Beauty) are seasonal. In addition, anticipation or occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, can drive unusually high demand for batteries. Additional information about our reportable segments can be found in MDA and Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Narrative Description of Business Business Model . Our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products, as well as the creation of new products. The markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons, e-commerce and high-frequency stores. We utilize our superior marketing and online presence to win with consumers at the \"zero moment of truth\" - when they are searching for information about a brand or product. We work collaboratively with our customers to improve the in-store presence of our products and win the \"first moment of truth\" - when a consumer is shopping in the store. We must also win the \"second moment of truth\" - when a consumer uses the product, evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and decides whether it was a good value. We believe we must continue to provide new, innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business. Research and product development activities, designed to enable sustained organic growth, continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year. While many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years, we believe these activities demonstrate our commitment to future growth. Key Product Categories . Information on key product categories can be found in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Key Customers . Our customers include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons, distributors, e-commerce and high-frequency stores. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 14% of our total revenue in 2014, 2013 and 2012. No other customer represents more than 10% of our net sales. Our top ten customers account for approximately 30% of our total unit volume in 2014 and 2013 and 31% of our total unit volume in 2012. The nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government. We believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete. Sources and Availability of Materials . Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from others, some of which are single-source suppliers. We produce certain raw materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing process and in the distribution of input materials and finished 12   The Procter  Gamble Company product to customers. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers. The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, none of which is material to our business taken as a whole. Trademarks and Patents . We own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. All major products and trademarks in each business are registered. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses. Competitive Condition . The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. We support our products with advertising, promotions and other marketing vehicles to build awareness and trial of our brands and products in conjunction with an extensive sales force. We believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products. Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important differentiating factors. Research and Development Expenditures . Research and development expenditures enable us to develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of our consumers. Total research and development expenses were $2.0 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012. Expenditures for Environmental Compliance . Expenditures for compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not material to the Company. No material change is expected in fiscal year 2015. Employees . Total number of employees is an estimate of total Company employees excluding interns, co-ops and employees of joint ventures. The number of employees includes manufacturing and non-manufacturing employees. A discussion of progress on non-manufacturing enrollment objectives is included in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Historical numbers include employees of discontinued operations.  ##TABLE_START  Total Number of Employees 118,000 121,000 126,000 129,000 127,000 132,000 ##TABLE_ENDFinancial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations Net sales in the U.S. account for approximately 35% of total net sales. No other individual country exceeds 10% of total net sales. Operations outside the U.S. are generally characterized by the same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may be affected by additional factors including changing currency values, different rates of inflation, economic growth and political and economic uncertainties and disruptions.

Risk Factors. We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-K, quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the The Procter  Gamble Company   13 time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. The following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with MDA and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes incorporated in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. A change in consumer demand for our products and/or lack of market growth could have a significant impact on our business.  We are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. We expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by focusing on the most profitable businesses, biggest innovations and most important emerging markets. We also expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. If demand for our products and/or market growth rates, in either developed or developing markets, falls substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our volume, and consequently our results, could be negatively impacted. This could occur due to, among other things, unforeseen negative economic or political events, unexpected changes in consumer trends and habits or negative consumer responses to pricing actions. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels. The consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, there are ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. This includes, among other things, increasing competition from mid- and lower-tier value products in both developed and developing markets. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms. In addition, the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer and consumer preferences, as well as market dynamics. Failure to effectively compete in these new channels could negatively impact results. Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and our ability to successfully respond to competitive innovation . Achieving our business results depends, in part, on the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products and improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. Successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance, to obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of others. We must also be able to successfully respond to technological advances made by competitors and intellectual property rights granted to competitors. Failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our results. Our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, energy costs, pension and healthcare costs and foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. In addition, our financial projections include cost savings described in our announced productivity plan. Failure to deliver these savings could adversely impact our results. We face risks that are inherent in global manufacturing that could negatively impact our business results. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements, to achieve our cost targets. While we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials, it may be impracticable to have a sufficient alternative source, particularly when the input materials are in limited supply. In addition, our strategy for global growth includes increased presence in emerging markets. Some emerging markets have greater political volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than established markets. Any significant disruption of manufacturing, such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, have an adverse impact on our business. 14   The Procter  Gamble Company We rely on third parties in many aspect our business, which creates additional risk. Due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties for certain functions, such as our suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners or external business partners. While we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and/or operational risk. We face risks associated with having significant international operations. We are a global company, with manufacturing operations in more than 40 countries and a significant portion of our revenue outside the U.S. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to: ##TABLE_START  compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with a variety of local regulations and laws; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from overseas; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales outside the U.S. ##TABLE_END We have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange, import authorization or pricing controls, including, but not limited to, Venezuela, Argentina, China, India and Egypt. Our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment. Fluctuations in exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition. We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are translated into U.S. dollars. Our operations outside of the U.S. generate a significant portion of our net revenue. Fluctuations in exchange rates may therefore adversely impact our business results or financial condition. See also the Results of Operations and Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity sections of the MDA and Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We face risks related to changes in the global and political economic environment, including the global capital and credit markets. Our business is impacted by global economic conditions, which continue to be volatile. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world. If the global economy experiences significant disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to: a slow-down in the general economy; supplier, vendor or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets; and/or temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. Our objective is to maintain credit ratings that provide us with ready access to global capital and credit markets. Any downgrade of our current credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. We could also be negatively impacted by political issues or crises in individual countries or regions, including sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments. For example, we could be adversely impacted by instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the European Union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the U.S. Consequently, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographies, as well as any political or economic disruption. These risks could negatively impact our overall liquidity and financing costs, as well as our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, and/or create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions. If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. The Company's reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, such as customers and suppliers. In addition, many of our brands have worldwide recognition. This recognition is the result of the large investments we have made in our products over many years. The quality and safety of our products is critical to our business. Our Company also devotes significant time and resources to programs that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. If we are unable to effectively The Procter  Gamble Company   15 manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, efficacy or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted; our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer. Our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands and the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination. Negative or inaccurate postings or comments about the Company could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands. In addition, given the association of our individual products with the Company, an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products, or the Company as a whole, thereby potentially hurting results. Our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change could impact our business results. Our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement. If we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. We continue to execute a number of significant business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies. We expect these types of changes, which may include many staffing adjustments as well as employee departures, to continue for the foreseeable future. Successfully managing these changes, including retention of particularly key employees, is critical to our business success. We are generally a build-from-within company and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense. Our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities could impact our business results. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, 2) we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with divested brands, or 3) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions and joint ventures, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets. Our business is subject to changes in legislation, regulation and enforcement, and our ability to manage and resolve pending legal matters in the U.S. and abroad. Changes in laws, regulations and related interpretations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and increased enforcement actions and penalties may alter the environment in which we do business. The increasingly complex and rapidly changing legal and regulatory environment creates additional challenges for our ethics and compliance programs. Our ability to continue to meet these challenges could have an impact on our legal, reputational and business risk. As a U.S.-based multinational company, we are subject to tax regulations in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the U.S. is not taxed in the U.S., provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. If these or other tax regulations should change, our financial results could be impacted. For example, there are increasing calls in the U.S. from members of leadership in both major U.S. political parties for comprehensive tax reform which may significantly change the income tax rules that are applicable to U.S. domiciled corporations, such as PG. It is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential legislation would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flows, but such changes could significantly impact our financial results. Our ability to manage regulatory, environmental, tax (including, but not limited to, any audits or other investigations) and legal matters (including, but not limited to, product liability, patent and other intellectual property matters) and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability may materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Furthermore, if pending legal matters, including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We sell most of our products via retail customers, which consist of mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons, distributors, e-commerce and high-frequency stores. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. This includes 16   The Procter  Gamble Company our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. Our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of our products or experience a significant business disruption. Consolidation among our retail customers could also create significant cost and margin pressure and lead to more complexity across broader geographic boundaries for both us and our key retailers. This would be particularly challenging if major customers are addressing local trade pressures, local law and regulation changes or financial distress. A breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. We rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems, networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. The various uses of these IT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: ##TABLE_START  ordering and managing materials from suppliers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  converting materials to finished products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  shipping products to customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  marketing and selling products to consumers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  processing transactions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  summarizing and reporting results of operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  providing data security; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  handling other processes necessary to manage our business. ##TABLE_END Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of our IT systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. The Company has made investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems, employee training and security policies for the Company and its third-party providers. However, because the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. If the IT systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. The costs and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. ", "1B": " Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. ", "2": " Item 2.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Management's Discussion and Analysis Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this report, other than historical and present factual information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including, without limitation, in the following sections: Management's Discussion and Analysis and Risk Factors. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believe, project, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, strategy, future, opportunity, plan, may, should, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled \"Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks\" and the section titled Risk Factors (Item 1A of this Form 10-K). Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. The following Management's Discussion and Analysis (MDA) is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of PG's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. MDA is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. MDA is organized in the following sections: ##TABLE_START  Overview ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Summary of 2014 Results ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Results of Operations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Segment Results ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Information  ##TABLE_END Throughout MDA, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain specified charges and gains. Free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of MDA provides more details on the use and derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in MDA are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category and are measured on an annual basis versus the prior 12 month period. References to competitive activity include promotional and product initiatives from our competitors. OVERVIEW PG is a global leader in fast moving consumer goods focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons, distributors, e-commerce and high-frequency stores. We continue to expand our presence in other channels, including perfumeries and pharmacies. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. The Procter  Gamble Company   23 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE Our organizational structure is comprised of Global Business Units (GBUs), Global Operations, Global Business Services (GBS) and Corporate Functions (CF). Global Business Units Under U.S. GAAP, the GBUs are aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby, Feminine and Family Care. The GBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the key product categories and brand composition within each segment. ##TABLE_START Reportable Segment % of Net Sales* % of Net Earnings* GBUs (Categories) Billion Dollar Brands Beauty 24% 23% Beauty Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Cosmetics, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); Hair Care and Color; Prestige; Salon Professional Head  Shoulders, Olay, Pantene, SK-II, Wella Grooming 10% 17% Shave Care (Electronic Hair Removal, Female Blades  Razors, Male Blades  Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care) Fusion, Gillette, Mach3, Prestobarba Health Care 9% 9% Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care); Oral Care (Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care) Crest, Oral-B, Vicks Fabric Care and Home Care 32% 26% Fabric Care (Laundry Additives, Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, PG Professional, Surface Care); Personal Power (Batteries) Ariel, Dawn, Downy, Duracell, Febreze, Gain, Tide Baby, Feminine and Family Care 25% 25% Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper) Always, Bounty, Charmin, Pampers ##TABLE_END*  Percent of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2014 (excluding results held in Corporate). Recent Developments: On July 31, 2014 the Company completed the divestiture of its pet care operations in North America, Latin America, and other selected countries to Mars, Incorporated (Mars) for $2.9 billion in an all-cash transaction. The gain or loss related to this transaction is not expected to be material and will be included in fiscal 2015 results. The European Union countries are not included in the agreement with Mars. The Company is pursuing alternate plans to sell its Pet Care business in these markets. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of our Pet Care business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and from segment results for all periods presented. Beauty: We are a global market leader in the beauty category. Most of the beauty markets in which we compete are highly fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. We compete in beauty care, hair care and color and prestige. In beauty care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to cosmetics to skin care, such as our Olay brand, which is the top facial skin care brand in the world with over 8% global market share. In hair care and color, we compete in both the retail and salon professional channels. We are the global market leader in the retail hair care and color market with over 20% global market share primarily behind our Pantene and Head  Shoulders brands. In the prestige channel, we compete primarily with our prestige fragrances behind Dolce  Gabbana, Gucci and Hugo Boss fragrance brands and the SK-II brand. Grooming: We are the global market leader in the blades and razors market globally. Our global blades and razors market share is approximately 70%, primarily behind the Gillette franchise including Fusion, Mach3, Prestobarba and Venus. Our electronic hair removal devices, such as electric razors and epilators, are sold under the Braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. We hold over 20% of the male shavers market and over 40% of the female epilators market. Health Care: We compete in oral care and personal health care. In oral care, there are several global competitors in the market and we have the number two market share position with approximately 20% global market share. In personal health care, we are a top ten competitor in a large, highly fragmented industry behind respiratory treatments (Vicks brand) and nonprescription heartburn medications (Prilosec OTC brand). Nearly all of our sales outside the U.S in personal health are generated through the PGT Healthcare partnership with Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd.  24   The Procter  Gamble Company Fabric Care and Home Care: This segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products, including: laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; home care products, including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners; and batteries. In fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader, with over 25% global market share, primarily behind our Tide, Ariel and Downy brands. Our global home care market share is approximately 20% across the categories in which we compete. In batteries, we have over 25% global battery market share, behind our Duracell brand. Baby, Feminine and Family Care: In baby care, we compete mainly in diapers, pants and baby wipes, with over 30% global market share. We are the number one or number two baby care competitor in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind Pampers, the Company's largest brand, with annual net sales of more than $10 billion. We are the global market leader in the feminine care category with over 30% global market share, primarily behind Always. Our family care business is predominantly a North American business comprised largely of the Bounty paper towel and Charmin toilet paper brands. U.S. market shares are approximately 45% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin. Global Operations Global Operations is comprised of our Sales and Market Operations (SMO), which is responsible for developing and executing go-to-market plans at the local level. The SMO includes dedicated retail customer, trade channel and country-specific teams. Through June 30, 2014, it was organized along five geographic regions: North America, Western Europe, Central  Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa (CEEMEA), Latin America and Asia, which is comprised of Japan, Greater China and ASEAN/Australia/India/Korea (AAIK). Throughout MDA, we reference business results in developing markets, which we define as the aggregate of CEEMEA, Latin America, AAIK and Greater China, and developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan. Effective July 1, 2014, our SMO reorganized under five revised regions, comprised of North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia, and India/Middle East/Africa (IMEA). Global Business Services GBS provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the GBUs and the SMO to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment. Corporate Functions CF provides Company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources and legal, as well as other centralized functional support. STRATEGIC FOCUS We are focused on strategies that we believe are right for the long-term health of the Company with the objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. We are focusing our resources on our leading, most profitable categories and markets: ##TABLE_START  Strengthening core categories, such as baby care and fabric care, and core markets, such as the U.S., to grow these businesses. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Investing in developing markets on the categories and countries with the largest size of prize and highest likelihood of winning. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Narrowing and refocusing the Company's portfolio to compete in categories and brands that are structurally attractive and that play to PG strengths and looking at alternatives to partner, divest or discontinue the balance. This will enable us to allocate resources to leading brands - marketed in the right set of countries, channels, and customers - where the size of the prize and probability of winning is highest. ##TABLE_END Innovation has always been - and continues to be - PG's lifeblood. To consistently win with consumers around the world across price tiers and preferences and to consistently win versus our best competitors, each PG product category needs a full portfolio of innovation, including a mix of commercial programs, product improvements and game-changing innovations. Productivity is a core strength for PG, which creates flexibility to fund our growth efforts and deliver our financial commitments. We have taken significant steps to accelerate productivity and savings across all elements of costs, including cost of goods sold, marketing expense and non-manufacturing overhead. Finally, we are focused on improving execution and operating discipline in everything we do. Operating discipline and execution have always been - and must continue to be - core capabilities and competitive advantages for PG. At current market growth rates, the Company expects the consistent delivery of the following annual financial targets will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive peer group: ##TABLE_START  Organic sales growth modestly above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Core EPS growth of high single digits; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater. ##TABLE_END The Procter  Gamble Company   25 SUMMARY OF 2014 RESULTS ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions, except per share amounts  Change vs. Prior Year   Change vs. Prior Year  Net sales $ 83,062  1%  $ 82,581  1%  $ 82,006 Operating income 15,288  7%  14,330  10%  13,035 Net earnings from continuing operations 11,707  4%  11,301  24%  9,150 Net earnings from discontinued operations  (23)%   (94)%  1,754 Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble 11,643  3%  11,312  5%  10,756 Diluted net earnings per common share 4.01  4%  3.86  5%  3.66 Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations 3.98  4%  3.83  25%  3.06 Core earnings per common share 4.22  5%  4.02  6%  3.79 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net sales increased 1% to $83.1 billion including a negative 2% impact from foreign exchange. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Organic sales increased 3%. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Unit volume increased 3%.

Foreign exchange impacts negatively impacted net earnings by approximately 9%. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $23 million due to reduced earnings in Pet Care from ongoing impacts of prior year product recalls. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted net earnings per share increased 4% to $4.01. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 4% to $3.98 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Core EPS increased 5% to $4.22. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash flow from operating activities was $14.0 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Free cash flow was $10.1 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Free cash flow productivity was 86%. ##TABLE_END ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES AND RISKS We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are \"forward-looking statements\" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete.

Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in this 10-K. Ability to Achieve Business Plans . We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the continued positive reputations of our brands. This means we must be able to obtain and maintain patents and trademarks and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in a more fast-paced and rapidly changing environment. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing net sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the markets in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms and product initiatives. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of ongoing acquisition, divestiture and joint venture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Daily conduct of our business also depends on our ability to maintain key information technology systems, including systems operated by third-party suppliers and to maintain security over our data. 26   The Procter  Gamble Company Cost Pressures . Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions, as well as ongoing productivity improvements. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in certain countries with currency exchange controls, such as Venezuela, China, India, Egypt and Argentina. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and manufacturing plant arrangements, and successfully manage any disruptions at Company manufacturing sites. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our established outsourcing relationships and those related to general overhead and workforce optimization. Successfully managing these changes, including identifying, developing and retaining key employees, is critical to our success. Global Economic Conditions . Demand for our products has a correlation to global macroeconomic factors. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic. Economic changes, terrorist activity, political unrest and natural disasters may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, due to terrorist and other hostile activities or natural disasters. We could also be negatively impacted by a global, regional or national economic crisis, including sovereign risk in the event of a deterioration in the credit worthiness of, or a default by local governments, resulting in a disruption of credit markets. Such events could negatively impact our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions and/or negatively impact our overall liquidity. Additionally, changes in exchange controls and other limits could impact our ability to repatriate earnings from overseas. Regulatory Environment . Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and tax laws or the enforcement thereof. Our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including, but not limited to, product liability, patent and other intellectual property matters) and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA), other non-operating items and income taxes. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, the level of initiatives and other activities by competitors, geographic expansion and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the U.S. Most of our cost of products sold and SGA are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary drivers of SGA are marketing-related costs and overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we do achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. Overhead costs are also variable in nature, but on a relative basis, less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth. Accordingly, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs. The Company is in the midst of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overhead expenses. The plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. The Company expects to incur in excess of $4.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a five-year period (fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2016) as part of this plan. Overall, the costs and other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions are expected to deliver in excess of $ 2.8 billion in annual gross before-tax savings (see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Net Sales Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Net sales increased 1% to $83.1 billion in 2014 on a 3% increase in unit volume versus the prior year period. Fabric Care and Home Care along with Baby, Feminine and Family Care volume grew mid-single digits. Grooming and Health Care volume grew low single digits. Beauty volume was unchanged. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and grew mid-single digits in developing regions. The Procter  Gamble Company   27 Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Organic sales grew 3% driven by the unit volume increase. A 1% favorable impact from higher pricing was offset by a 1% impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix due to higher relative growth of developing regions, which have lower than average selling prices, and of lower priced product categories such as Fabric Care and Baby Care. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Net sales increased 1% to $82.6 billion in 2013 on a 2% increase in unit volume. Volume in Health Care and Baby, Feminine and Family Care grew mid-single digits. Volume in Fabric Care and Home Care grew low single digits. Beauty volume was in line with the prior year. Grooming volume decreased low single digits. Volume grew low single digits in both developed and developing regions. The impact of overall global market growth was partially offset by market share declines in certain categories. Price increases added 1% to net sales, driven by price increases across all business segments, primarily executed in prior periods to offset cost increases and devaluing developing market currencies. Foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Organic sales growth was 3% driven by both volume and price increases. Operating Costs ##TABLE_START Comparisons as a percentage of net sales; Years ended June 30  Basis Point Change   Basis Point Change  Gross margin 48.9 %  (100 )  49.9 %   49.5 % Selling, general and administrative expense 30.5 %  (170 )  32.2 %   31.7 % Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges  %  (40 )  0.4 %  (150 )  1.9 % Operating margin 18.4 %   17.4 %   15.9 % Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 17.9 %   17.8 %   15.3 % Net earnings from continuing operations 14.1 %   13.7 %   11.2 % Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble 14.0 %   13.7 %   13.1 % ##TABLE_ENDFiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Gross margin contracted 100 basis points to 48.9% of net sales in 2014. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by a 150 basis point impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix, a 50 basis point impact from higher commodity costs, and a 90 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings of 190 basis points and a 40 basis point benefit from higher pricing. The unfavorable geographic and product mix was caused by disproportionate growth in developing regions, and the Fabric Care and Home Care and Baby, Feminine and Family Care segments, which have lower gross margins than the Company average. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5% to $25.3 billion in 2014 due to a reduction in marketing spending, overhead expense and restructuring costs. SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased 170 basis points to 30.5%. Lower restructuring spending drove 30 basis points of the decline. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 80 basis points primarily due to lower spending behind a focus on more efficient marketing support and scale benefits from increased net sales. Overhead spending decreased 50 basis points from productivity savings of 40 basis points and scale benefits from increased net sales. The 2014 impact from foreign currency policy changes in Venezuela was comparable to the prior year devaluation impact. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Gross margin expanded 40 basis points in 2013 to 49.9% of net sales, driven by higher pricing and manufacturing cost savings, partially offset by negative mix and higher commodity costs. Gross margin was positively impacted by 70 basis points from higher pricing and approximately 160 basis points from manufacturing cost savings. Gross margin was negatively impacted by 160 basis points from negative geographic and product mix behind disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier products, both of which have lower gross margins than the Company average. Gross margin was also reduced by capacity investments and to a lesser extent by foreign exchange impacts and higher commodity costs. Total SGA increased 2% to $26.6 billion in 2013, driven by a charge for the balance sheet impact from the devaluation of the official foreign exchange rate in Venezuela and an increase in marketing spending, partially offset by reduced overhead costs as a result of the productivity and cost savings plan. SGA as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points to 32.2% largely due to a 40 basis point impact from the Venezuela devaluation charge and a 10 basis point increase in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales declined 20 basis points, as a 70 basis point benefit from our productivity and cost savings plan and 20 basis points of lower restructuring costs were largely offset by the impact of foreign exchange. This was due to a higher 28   The Procter  Gamble Company portion of SGA spending in strengthening currencies as compared to net sales, higher employee wages and benefit costs and increased merchandising investments. In fiscal 2013 we incurred impairment charges of $308 million ($290 million after-tax) related to the carrying value of goodwill in our Appliances business and the related Braun trade name intangible asset. In fiscal 2012 we incurred impairment charges of $1.6 billion ($1.5 billion after-tax) related to the carrying values of goodwill in our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses and our Koleston Perfect and Wella indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are part of our Salon Professional business. See Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details, including factors leading to the impairment charges. Since goodwill is included in Corporate for internal management and segment reporting, the goodwill impairment charges are included in the Corporate segment. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments are also included in the Corporate segment for management and segment reporting. Non-Operating Items Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Interest expense increased 6% in 2014 to $709 million, primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding. Interest income was $100 million in 2014, an increase of $13 million versus the prior year due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. Other non-operating income, net, primarily includes divestiture gains and investment income. Other non-operating income decreased $736 million to $206 million, primarily due to acquisition and divestiture impacts. In 2014, we had approximately $150 million in divestiture gains, primarily related to the sale of our bleach businesses in CEEMEA and Latin America, our Pert hair care business in Latin America and MDVIP. The prior year acquisition and divestiture activities included a $631 million holding gain resulting from PG's purchase of the balance of its Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia and an approximate $250 million gain from the divestiture of our Italy bleach business. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Interest expense decreased 13% in 2013 to $667 million, due to lower interest rates on floating-rate debt. Interest income increased 13% in 2013 to $87 million, due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and debt securities. Other non-operating income increased $757 million to $942 million in 2013 mainly due to net acquisition and divestiture activities. The $631 million holding gain resulting from the purchase of the balance of PG's Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia and the gain of approximately $250 million from the sale of our Italian bleach business, both in fiscal 2013, were partially offset by a $130 million divestiture gain from the PUR water filtration business in 2012. Income Taxes Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 170 basis points to 21.4% in 2014. The primary driver of this rate decline was approximately 320 basis points from the favorable geographic mix of earnings and approximately 60 basis points due to the non-deductibility of the prior year impairment charges related to our Appliances business. These impacts were partially offset by a 50 basis point increase due to the Venezuela currency policy changes and devaluation discussed below (which decreased the prior year rate 20 basis points and increased the current year rate by 30 basis points), a 110 basis point increase due to the tax impacts of acquisition and divestiture activities (the gains from the purchase of the balance of the Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia and the sale of our Italy bleach business in the prior year), and a 30 basis point increase is due to the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions. The net benefit on the current year was $228 million, or 150 basis points, versus 180 basis points of net benefit in the prior year. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 390 basis points to 23.1% in 2013. The primary drivers of this rate decline were approximately 210 basis points due to the non-deductibility of impairment charges related to our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses, which were higher in the base period versus the current year, approximately 100 basis points due to the tax impacts from acquisition and divestiture activity (primarily the non-taxable gain on the purchase of the balance of the Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia), approximately 20 basis points from the impact of the Venezuela currency devaluation, and approximately 50 basis points due to the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions. The 2013 net benefit was $275 million, or 180 basis points, versus a net benefit of 130 basis points in 2012. Net Earnings Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Net earnings from continuing operations increased $406 million or 4% to $11.7 billion in 2014 due to the increase in sales and a 40-basis point expansion in net earnings margin. The increase in net earnings margin was primarily driven by the decrease in SGA as a percentage of net sales and the lower tax rate, partially offset by the gross margin contraction and the acquisition and divestiture-driven net reduction in other non-operating income, net. Net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $23 million in 2014 due to ongoing impacts of prior year product recalls in Pet Care. Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble increased $331 million, or 3% to $11.6 billion. The Procter  Gamble Company   29 Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 4% to $3.98 primarily due to the increase in net earnings. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations was $0.03 due to the earnings of the Pet Care business. Diluted net earnings per share increased 4% to $4.01. Core EPS increased 5% to $4.22 primarily due to increased net sales, a 40 basis point net earnings margin expansion and the reduction in shares outstanding. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the current and prior year charge for the balance sheet impacts from foreign exchange policy changes and the devaluation of the foreign exchange rates in Venezuela (see below), the prior year holding gain on the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture, impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the prior year and charges in both years for European legal matters and incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Net earnings from continuing operations increased $2.2 billion or 24% to $11.3 billion in 2013. The combination of the net year-over-year impact of acquisition and divestiture gains and the net year-over-year decline in impairment charges drove $1.9 billion of the increase. Earnings also increased due to the increase in net sales and the  40 basis point gross margin expansion in 2013. Net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $1.7 billion in 2013 due to the gain on the divestiture of the Snacks business and the earnings from the Snacks business prior to the divestiture in the prior year. Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble increased $556 million, or 5% to $11.3 billion. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 25% to $3.83 in 2013 due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in shares outstanding. The number of shares outstanding decreased due to $6.0 billion of treasury share repurchases under our publicly announced share repurchase program, partially offset by shares issued under share-based compensation plans. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations was $0.03 due to the earnings of the Pet Care business. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations in 2012 was $0.60 primarily due to the gain on the divestiture of the Snacks business and earnings of the Snacks business prior to divestiture. Diluted net earnings per share increased 5% to $3.86. Core EPS increased 6% to $4.02 in 2013 primarily due to increased net sales, gross margin expansion and the reduction in shares outstanding. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the 2013 charge for the balance sheet impact from the devaluation of the official foreign exchange rate in Venezuela, the 2013 holding gain on the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture and charges in both years for European legal matters, incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan and impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Venezuela Currency Impacts Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. As a result, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Venezuela. Any currency remeasurement adjustments for non-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by these subsidiaries and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. For the current fiscal year, Venezuela represented approximately 1% of the Companys consolidated net sales and operating profit excluding the impact of the remeasurement charge discussed below. Through December 31, 2013, the Venezuelan government had established one official exchange rate for qualifying dividends and imported goods and services. Transactions at the official exchange rate are subject to approval by CENCOEX (National Center for External Commerce), previously CADIVI (Foreign Exchange Administrative Commission). Effective February 9, 2013 the Venezuelan government devalued its currency from 4.3 to 6.3 Venezuelan bolivares fuerte (VEF) per dollar. The remeasurement of our local balance sheets to reflect this devaluation in the fiscal year ended 2013 resulted in an after tax charge of $236 million ($0.08 per share). In addition to the preferential CENCOEX exchange rate, there are and have been parallel exchange markets controlled by the Central Bank of Venezuela as the only legal intermediary to execute foreign exchange transactions outside of CENCOEX. Through December 31, 2013, various regulations and a limited notional amount of transactions that ran through these programs essentially eliminated the Company's ability to access any foreign exchange rate other than the preferential rate to pay for imported goods and/or manage our local monetary asset balances. Accordingly, all of our net monetary assets were measured at the preferential 6.3 VEF per dollar exchange rate through December 31, 2013. In addition, through December 31, 2013, our results in Venezuela were reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at the official CADIVI rate, which was the rate we expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations. On January 24, 2014, the government made a number of announcements affecting currency exchange rate and other controls. The preferential CENCOEX exchange rate remains at 6.3 VEF per dollar. In addition, while there is considerable uncertainty as to the nature of transactions that will flow through CENCOEX and how CENCOEX will operate in the future, the Company believes that a significant portion of its imports will continue to qualify for the preferential rate. However, the importation of certain finished goods and raw materials for some product categories, along with the payment of dividends and 30   The Procter  Gamble Company royalties, will be executed under the SICAD (Complementary System for Foreign Exchange Administration) program. SICAD is an auction-based exchange program. The Company expects to be able to access the SICAD program for dividends and other transactions. The rate available through SICAD was 11.7 VEF per dollar in January 2014, and was 10.6 VEF per dollar at June 30, 2014. The Company incurred an after tax charge of $275 million ($0.09 per share) in January 2014 to remeasure certain portions of our local Venezuela balance sheets not qualifying for the preferential CENCOEX rate to the initial SICAD exchange rate. In late March 2014, the government introduced a third exchange mechanism, referred to as SICAD II, which is also an auction-based program currently trading at approximately 50.0 VEF per dollar. The Company does not expect to access SICAD II. Accordingly, the underlying SICAD II exchange rates have not been utilized for purposes of remeasuring or translating our Venezuela results. As of June 30, 2014, the Company had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of approximately $1.0 billion. Approximately $670 million of that amount is expected to be utilized to satisfy liabilities for past imports that were approved under CENCOEX and are measured at the preferential 6.3 VEF per dollar rate. The remaining balance has been measured at the SICAD rate. Local currency net monetary balances increased approximately $110 million versus June 30, 2013 as increases due to earnings in Venezuela, the timing of CENCOEX payments and an increase in the net amount of indirect value added taxes (VAT) receivable from the government from goods receipts and shipments, was partially offset by the remeasurement of balances from the preferential CENCOEX rate to the SICAD rate. Other controls imposed by the Venezuelan government include import authorization controls, currency exchange and payment controls, price controls and recently enacted profit margin controls. The ongoing impact of the recent announcements and our ability to restore net sales and profit to levels achieved prior to the recent devaluations will be impacted by several factors. These include our ability to mitigate the effect of the price and profit margin controls, any potential future devaluation of the preferential CENCOEX exchange rate, any significant change in the  auction exchange rates or liquidity in the SICAD program, any migration of additional product categories from the CENCOEX to the SICAD rates, any Company actions to access the SICAD II market, any further Venezuelan government price or exchange controls, economic conditions and the availability of raw materials and utilities. In addition, depending on the future availability of U.S. dollars at the preferential rate, our local U.S. dollar needs, our overall repatriation plans, including our ability to obtain government approval for the payment of dividends, which has been limited in recent years, the creditworthiness of the local depository institutions and other creditors and our ability to collect amounts due from customers and the government, including VAT receivables, we may have exposure for our local monetary assets. SEGMENT RESULTS Segment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs such as interest expense, investing activities and certain restructuring and asset impairment costs. These costs are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, as described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments. Eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate. We previously had a difference in the treatment of certain unconsolidated investees. Certain unconsolidated investees that are managed as integral parts of our businesses were reflected as consolidated subsidiaries for management reporting and in segment results, with full recognition of the individual income statement line items through before-tax earnings. Eliminations to adjust these line items to U.S. GAAP were included in Corporate. In determining after-tax earnings for the businesses, we eliminated the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest, and applied statutory tax rates. During the final quarter of fiscal 2014, we changed our management accounting for unconsolidated investees. Pursuant to this change, segment results no longer include full recognition of the individual income statement line items of unconsolidated investees and eliminations of such amounts are no longer included in Corporate. All periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. All references to net earnings throughout the discussion of segment results refer to net earnings from continuing operations.

Global market share of the beauty care category decreased nearly half a point. Volume in Salon Professional decreased mid-single digits due to competitive activity and European market contraction. Volume in Prestige decreased low single digits due to minor brand divestitures. Net earnings increased 11% to $2.7 billion due to a 160 basis point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to a decrease in SGA and a gain on a minor brand divestiture (Pert in Latin America), partially offset by gross margin contraction. SGA decreased primarily due to a reduction in marketing spending resulting from optimization efforts. Gross margin decreased slightly due to the impact of foreign exchange and negative geographic and product mix, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Beauty net sales decreased 2% to $20.0 billion in 2013 on unit volume that was in line with the prior year period. Organic sales increased 1%. Price increases contributed 2% to net sales growth.

Volume in Salon Professional was in line with the prior year period due to mid-single-digit growth in developing markets behind new innovations, offset by a low single-digit decline in developed regions from market contraction. Volume in Prestige was in line with the prior year period due to minor brand divestitures and market contraction in Western Europe, offset by innovation and market growth in developing markets. Organic volume in Prestige increased low single digits. Net earnings increased 4% to $2.5 billion, as lower net sales were more than offset by a 60-basis point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to gross margin expansion, a decrease in SGA as a percentage of sales and a lower effective tax rate. Gross margin increased behind manufacturing cost savings and higher pricing. SGA as a percentage of net sales declined largely due to reduced overhead spending.

Batteries volume increased low single digits due to a mid-single-digit increase in developing regions from market growth and geographic expansion, partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in developed markets due to market contraction and share losses, primarily behind higher pricing in Western Europe to improve the margin structure. Global market share of the batteries category was unchanged. Net earnings increased 10% to $3.1 billion due to a 90-basis point increase in net earnings margin and the increase in net sales. Net earnings margin increased due to gross margin expansion. Gross margin increased due to higher pricing and manufacturing cost savings, partially offset by higher commodity costs. SGA as a percentage of net sales was unchanged as higher marketing spending was offset by reduced overhead costs.

Organic sales were up 4% on 3% organic volume growth. Price increases primarily in Baby Care increased net sales by 1%. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3%. Global market share of the Baby, Feminine and Family Care segment decreased 0.3 points. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and mid-single digits in developing regions. Volume in Baby Care increased mid-single digits due to a mid-single digit increase in developing regions, from market growth and product innovation, and a mid-single digit increase in developed regions due to the buyout of our joint venture partner in Iberia and product innovation in North America, partially offset by competitive activity. Global market share of the baby care category decreased slightly. Volume in Feminine Care increased mid-single digits due to a mid-single digit increase in developed regions, from the buyout of our joint venture partner in Iberia and innovation, and a low single digit increase in developing regions, from market growth and innovation. Organic volume was up low single digits. Global market share of the feminine care category decreased less than half a point. Volume in Family Care increased low single digits due to product innovation on Charmin and Bounty and lower pricing, partially offset by competitive activity. In the U.S., all-outlet share of the family care category decreased less than half point. Net earnings decreased 4% to $2.9 billion as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 90-basis point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased primarily due to gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased due to the impact of foreign exchange, higher commodity costs, and unfavorable product and geographic mix from disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier products, both of which have lower gross margins than the segment average, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and pricing. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Baby, Feminine and Family Care net sales increased 4% to $20.5 billion in 2013 on 5% volume growth. Organic sales were up 6% on 3% organic volume growth. Pricing added 2% to net sales growth. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Global market share of the Baby, Feminine and Family Care segment decreased 0.2 points. Volume increased mid-single digits in both developing and developed regions. Volume in Baby Care increased mid-single digits. Excluding the buyout of our joint venture partner in Iberia, organic volume increased low-single digits as a mid-single digit increase in developing regions from market growth, distribution expansion and innovation, was partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in developed regions due to market contraction and competitive promotional activity, primarily in Western Europe. Global market share of the baby care category decreased nearly half a point. Volume in Feminine Care increased mid-single digits from mid-single-digit growth in developing markets behind market growth and innovation and high single-digit increase in developed regions due to the buyout of our joint venture partner in Iberia. Global market share of the feminine care category was down half a point. Volume in Family Care increased mid-single digits primarily due to market growth and innovation on Charmin and Bounty. In the U.S., all-outlet share of the family care category was flat. Net earnings increased 4% to $3.0 billion due to the increase in net sales. Net earnings margin was down slightly due to gross margin expansion offset by a higher effective tax rate. The increase in gross margin was driven by the impact of higher pricing and manufacturing and commodity cost savings, partially offset by unfavorable product and geographic mix. The effective tax rate increased due to the geographic mix of earnings.

These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical results of certain divested brands and categories; certain asset impairment charges; The Procter  Gamble Company   35 certain balance sheet impacts from significant foreign exchange devaluations; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item includes income taxes to adjust from blended statutory tax rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Net sales in Corporate increased by $176 million in 2014. Corporate net earnings improved by $191 million in 2014 primarily due to reduced net after-tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges (which totaled $290 million in the prior year but were zero in the current period), lower current year restructuring and overhead spending and lower overall Company effective tax rate, partially offset by the holding gain in the prior year from the buyout of our Iberian joint venture partner. Additional discussion of the items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section. In 2013, net sales in Corporate decreased by $258 million due to a reduction in sales from PG Chemicals as a result of lower commodity prices. Corporate net earnings improved $1.6 billion primarily due to reduced net after-tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges (which totaled $1.5 billion in the prior year as compared to $290 million in the current period), along with the 2013 net after-tax holding gain related to the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture, partially offset by the 2013 charge for the impact of the Venezuela devaluation. Additional discussion of the items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section above. Productivity and Cost Savings Plan In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. As part of this plan, the Company expects to incur in excess of $4.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a five-year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2016). Approximately 62% of the costs have been incurred through the end of fiscal 2014. Savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the corollary benefits achieved (e.g., enrollment reduction achieved via normal attrition), the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. Overall, the costs and other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions are expected to deliver in excess of $2.8 billion in annual gross savings (before-tax). The cumulative before-tax savings realized through 2014 were approximately $1.4 billion. Restructuring accruals of $381 million as of June 30, 2014, are classified as current liabilities. Approximately 75% of the restructuring charges incurred during fiscal 2014 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. Refer to Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program. CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations. Operating Cash Flow Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Operating cash flow was $14.0 billion in 2014, a 6% decrease from the prior year, which was primarily driven by a $1 billion discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan. Operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and gains on sale and purchase of businesses) partially offset by the impact of other operating assets and liabilities. Working capital changes did not have a significant impact on operating cash flow in 2014. Reduced accounts receivable generated $87 million of cash primarily due to improved collection results, which, along with the timing and mix of sales late in the period, drove a 1 day decrease in accounts receivable days sales outstanding. Inventory changes did not significantly impact operating cash flow as inventory management improvement efforts offset inventory needed to support product initiatives and build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes. Inventory days on hand decreased by 3 days primarily due to inventory management improvement efforts. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities also did not significantly impact operating cash flow. Other operating assets and liabilities utilized $1.6 billion of cash, primarily driven by $1 billion of cash used for a discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan. 36   The Procter  Gamble Company Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Operating cash flow was $14.9 billion in 2013, a 12% increase from the prior year. Operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, deferred income taxes and gains on sale and purchase of businesses) and a decrease in working capital. Increased accounts receivable used $415 million of cash primarily to fund growth. In addition, accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased two days due to the timing and mix of sales late in the period and foreign exchange impacts. Increased inventory used $225 million of cash to support product initiatives and to build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes, partially offset by inventory management improvement efforts. Inventory days on hand increased by one day primarily due to foreign exchange impacts. Increased accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities generated $1.3 billion of cash primarily due to an increase in marketing accruals from increased advertising and other marketing costs. Free Cash Flow. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Free cash flow was $10.1 billion in 2014, a decrease of 7% versus the prior year. The decrease was driven by the decrease in operating cash flows, which was primarily due to a $1 billion discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan. Free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings, was 86% in 2014. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Free cash flow was $10.9 billion in 2013, an increase of 17% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows. Free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings, was 95% in 2013. Investing Cash Flows Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Net investing activities consumed $4.1 billion in cash in 2014 mainly due to capital spending and cash paid for investments in available-for-sale securities, partially offset by asset sales. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Net investing activities consumed $6.3 billion in cash in 2013 mainly due to capital spending, cash paid for acquisitions and investments in available-for-sale securities, partially offset by asset sales. Capital Spending. We manage capital spending to support our business growth plans and have cost controls to deliver our cash generation targets. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $3.8 billion in 2014 and $4.0 billion in 2013. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 4.6% in 2014. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales in 2013 increased 10 basis points to 4.9%. Acquisitions. Acquisition activity was not material in 2014. Acquisitions used $1.1 billion of cash in 2013 primarily for the acquisition of our partner's interest in a joint venture in Iberia. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $570 million in cash in 2014 mainly due to minor brand divestiture activities, including MDVIP, the Pert business in Latin America, and the bleach business in CEEMEA and Latin America. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $584 million in cash in 2013 mainly due to the divestitures of the bleach business in Italy and the Braun household appliances business. Financing Cash Flows Dividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 7% to $2.45 per share in 2014. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $6.9 billion in 2014 and $6.5 billion in 2013. In April 2014, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.6015 to $0.6436 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This represents a 7% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 58th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend in every year since our incorporation in 1890. Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $35.4 billion as of June 30, 2014 and $31.5 billion as of June 30, 2013. Our total debt increased in 2014 mainly due to debt issuances and an increase in commercial paper outstanding, partially offset by bond maturities. Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $6.0 billion in 2014 and 2013. Liquidity At June 30, 2014, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $2.1 billion ($4.3 billion, excluding current assets and current liabilities of the Pet Care business held for sale), largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses The Procter  Gamble Company   37 its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. The majority of our cash is held off-shore by foreign subsidiaries, but we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the United States to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. On June 30, 2014, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard  Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings are Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard  Poor's), all with a stable outlook. We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $11.0 billion facility split between a $7.0 billion 5-year facility and a $4.0 billion 364-day facility, which expire in August 2018 and July 2015, respectively. The 364-day facility can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in, and in accordance with, the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain largely undrawn for the foreseeable future. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity.  38   The Procter  Gamble Company Contractual Commitments The following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2014. ##TABLE_START ($ millions) Total  Less Than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  After 5 Years RECORDED LIABILITIES          Total debt $ 35,229  $ 15,576  $ 4,391  $ 3,939  $ 11,323 Capital leases     Uncertain tax positions (1)        OTHER          Interest payments relating to long-term debt 7,929   1,385  1,195  4,518 Operating leases (2) 1,944     Minimum pension funding (3)       Purchase obligations (4) 1,985  1,068    TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS 48,024  18,083  7,304  5,725  16,912 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  As of June 30, 2014, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $1.9 billion, including $443 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2014, cannot be made. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2017 are not currently determinable. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing. Approximately 19% relates to service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position. ##TABLE_END SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement or net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized to reduce future taxes. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment. The Procter  Gamble Company   39 Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized. We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. For additional details on the Company's income taxes, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Employee Benefits We sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits. The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense, since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2014, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets was 7.2% and 8.3%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $111 million. Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans of 3.5% and 4.4%, respectively, represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100-basis point change in the pension discount rate would impact annual after-tax defined benefit pension expense by approximately $197 million. A change in the OPEB discount rate of 100 basis points would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $79 million. For additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. 40   The Procter  Gamble Company Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are primarily based on these same factors. All of our acquired technology and customer-related intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives. The costs of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. We test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the book values of each asset to the estimated fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. With the exception of our Appliances, Batteries and Salon Professional businesses, all of our reporting units have fair values that significantly exceed recorded values. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. In addition, any potential change in the strategic plans for these businesses due to the refocusing of our business portfolio could impact these judgments, assumptions, and estimates, in turn, impacting our fair value. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year. The recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets from recently impaired businesses and recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and therefore are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge. The results of our impairment testing during fiscal 2012 indicated that the estimated fair values of our Appliances and Salon Professional reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts. Therefore, we recorded a non-cash before- and after-tax impairment charge of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2012. Additionally, our impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets during fiscal 2012 indicated a decline in the fair value of our Koleston Perfect and Wella trade name intangible assets below their respective carrying values. This resulted in a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge of $246 million ($173 million after-tax) to reduce the carrying amounts of these assets to their estimated fair values. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the estimated fair value of our Appliances reporting units declined further, below the carrying amount resulting from the fiscal 2012 impairment. Therefore, we recorded an additional non-cash before and after-tax impairment charge of $259 million in fiscal 2013. Additionally, our fourth quarter 2013 impairment testing for Appliances indicated a decline in the fair value of our Braun trade name intangible asset below its carrying value. This resulted in a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge of $49 million ($31 million after-tax) to reduce the carrying amount of this asset to its estimated fair value. The Appliances business was acquired as part of the Gillette acquisition in 2005 and the Salon Professional business consists primarily of operations acquired in the Wella acquisition in 2004. Both businesses are stand-alone reporting units. These businesses represent some of our more discretionary consumer spending categories. Because of this, their operations and underlying fair values were disproportionately impacted by the economic downturn that began in fiscal 2009, which led to a reduction in home and personal grooming appliance purchases and in visits to hair salons that drove the fiscal 2012 impairment. The additional impairment of the Appliances business in fiscal 2013 was due to the devaluation of currency in Japan, a key country that generates a significant portion of the earnings of the Appliances business, relative to the currencies in which the underlying net assets are recorded. As of June 30, 2014, the Appliances business has remaining goodwill of $317 million and remaining intangible assets of $875 million, while the Salon Professional business has remaining goodwill of $436 million and remaining intangible assets of $726 million. As a result of the impairments, the estimated fair value of our Appliances business and the Salon Professional business slightly exceed their respective carrying values. Our fiscal 2014 valuations of the Appliances and Salon Professional businesses has them returning to sales and earnings growth The Procter  Gamble Company   41 rates consistent with our long-term business plans. Changes to or a failure to achieve these business plans or a further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions could result in a valuation that would trigger an additional impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses. The results of our annual goodwill impairment testing during fiscal 2014 indicated a decline in the fair value of the Batteries reporting unit due to lower long-term market growth assumptions in certain key geographies. The estimated fair value of Batteries continues to exceed its underlying carrying value, but the fair value cushion has been reduced to about 5%. As of June 30, 2014, the Batteries business has goodwill of $2.6 billion and intangible assets of $2.4 billion. The actual Batteries business results for the year ended June 30, 2014 were in line with the 2014 projections used in our annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing. The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, actual events and results of the Batteries reporting unit could differ substantially from those used in our valuations. To the extent such factors result in a further reduction of the level of projected cash flows used to estimate the Batteries reporting unit fair value, we may need to record non-cash impairment charges in the future. In addition, in the fourth quarter of the year ended June 30, 2014, a key competitor announced its intent to split its consolidated business into two separate companies during 2015. One of those companies would operate primarily in the batteries category. While this proposed transaction has not been consummated, initial independent third party estimates of the competitors stand-alone batteries business valuation are well below the earnings multiple implied from the valuation of our batteries business. We attribute the implied valuation differences to our more favorable business trends, primarily organic net sales and share growth, along with scale dis-synergies, general market uncertainty regarding the capabilities and competitiveness of a stand-alone company and lack of a control premium. In addition, the Company conducts a regular portfolio review of its businesses to assess long-term strategic fit. If our portfolio review process were to result in a decision to divest the batteries business, a divestiture could result in a loss that could be material if potential acquirers utilize valuations consistent with those indicated above for the key competitor. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing results. New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This guidance outlines a single, comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. We will adopt the standard on July 1, 2017. We are evaluating the impact, if any, that the standard will have on our financial statements. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. OTHER INFORMATION Hedging and Derivative Financial Instruments As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. Except within financing operations, we leverage the Company's broadly diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments. Derivative positions can be monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the CorporateManager value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics dataset as of June 30, 2014. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics, a reasonable proxy is included. Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term. Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on 42   The Procter  Gamble Company our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments. Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2014, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements. Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with our financing operations, we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months. In addition, we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions. Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2014, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements. Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures. As of and during the years ended June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013, we did not have any commodity hedging activity. Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAP Our discussion of financial results includes several \"non-GAAP\" financial measures. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MDA, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. These measures include: Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:  ##TABLE_START Year ended June 30, 2014 Net Sales Growth  Foreign Exchange Impact  Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact*  Organic Sales Growth Beauty %  %  %  % Grooming %  %  %  % Health Care %  %  %  % Fabric Care and Home Care %  %  %  % Baby, Feminine and Family Care %  %  %  % TOTAL COMPANY %  %  %  %         Year ended June 30, 2013 Net Sales Growth  Foreign Exchange Impact  Acquisition/ Divestiture Impact*  Organic Sales Growth Beauty %  %  %  % Grooming %  %  %  % Health Care %  %  %  % Fabric Care and Home Care %  %  %  % Baby, Feminine and Family Care %  %  %  % TOTAL COMPANY %  %  %  % ##TABLE_END* Acquisition/Divestiture Impact includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. Core EPS. This is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. This includes charges in 2014, 2013 and 2012 for incremental restructuring due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings, charges in 2014 and 2013 for the balance sheet impacts from foreign exchange policy changes and the devaluations of the official foreign currency exchange rate in Venezuela, charges in 2014, 2013 and 2012 related to pending European legal matters, a holding gain in 2013 on the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture (JV), and impairment charges in 2013 and 2012 for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets . We do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results. We believe the Core EPS measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year earnings per share growth. Core EPS is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The Procter  Gamble Company   43 The table below provides a reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to Core EPS: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   Diluted net earnings per share - continuing operations $ 3.98  $ 3.83  $ 3.06 Incremental restructuring charges 0.12  0.18  0.20 Venezuela balance sheet devaluation Impacts 0.09  0.08   Charges for pending European legal matters 0.02  0.05  0.03 Gain on purchase of balance of Iberian JV   (0.21 )   Impairment charges   0.10  0.51 Rounding 0.01  (0.01 )  (0.01 ) CORE EPS 4.22  4.02  3.79 Core EPS Growth %  %  (1 )% ##TABLE_ENDNote - All reconciling items are presented net of tax. Tax effects are calculated consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction. Free Cash Flow. Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Free Cash Flow Productivity. Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. Free cash flow productivity is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING At The Procter  Gamble Company, we take great pride in our long history of doing what's right. If you analyze what's made our Company successful over the years, you may focus on our brands, our marketing strategies, our organization design and our ability to innovate. But if you really want to get at what drives our Company's success, the place to look is our people. Our people are deeply committed to our Purpose, Values and Principles. It is this commitment to doing what's right that unites us. This commitment to doing what's right is embodied in our financial reporting. High-quality financial reporting is our responsibility, one we execute with integrity, and within both the letter and spirit of the law. High-quality financial reporting is characterized by accuracy, objectivity and transparency. Management is responsible for maintaining an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting to deliver those characteristics in all material respects. The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, provides oversight. We have engaged Deloitte  Touche LLP to audit our Consolidated Financial Statements, on which they have issued an unqualified opinion. Our commitment to providing timely, accurate and understandable information to investors encompasses: Communicating expectations to employees . Every employee, from senior management on down, is required to be trained on the Company's Worldwide Business Conduct Manual , which sets forth the Company's commitment to conduct its business affairs with high ethical standards. Every employee is held personally accountable for compliance and is provided several means of reporting any concerns about violations of the Worldwide Business Conduct Manual , which is available on our website at www.pg.com. Maintaining a strong internal control environment . Our system of internal controls includes written policies and procedures, segregation of duties and the careful selection and development of employees. The system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are executed as authorized and appropriately recorded, that assets are safeguarded and that accounting records are sufficiently reliable to permit the preparation of financial statements conforming in all material respects with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We monitor these internal controls through control self-assessments conducted by business unit management. In addition to performing financial and compliance audits around the world, our Global Internal Audit organization provides training and continuously improves internal control processes. Appropriate actions are taken by management to correct any identified control deficiencies. Executing financial stewardship . We maintain specific programs and activities to ensure that employees understand their fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders. This ongoing effort encompasses financial discipline in strategic and daily business decisions and brings particular focus to maintaining accurate financial reporting and effective controls through process improvement, skill development and oversight. Exerting rigorous oversight of the business . We continuously review business results and strategic choices. Our Global Leadership Council is actively involved - from understanding strategies to reviewing key initiatives, financial performance and control assessments. The intent is to ensure we remain objective, identify potential issues, continuously challenge each other and ensure recognition and rewards are appropriately aligned with results. Engaging our Disclosure Committee . We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported timely and accurately. Our Disclosure Committee is a group of senior-level executives responsible for evaluating disclosure implications of significant business activities and events. The Committee reports its findings to the CEO and CFO, providing an effective process to evaluate our external disclosure obligations. Strong and effective corporate governance from our Board of Directors . We have an active, capable and diligent Board that meets the required standards for independence, and we welcome the Board's oversight. Our Audit Committee comprises independent directors with significant financial knowledge and experience. We review significant accounting policies, financial reporting and internal control matters with them and encourage their independent discussions with external auditors. Our corporate governance guidelines, as well as the charter of the Audit Committee and certain other committees of our Board, are available on our website at www.pg.com. PG has a strong history of doing what's right. Our employees embrace our Purpose, Values and Principles. We take responsibility for the quality and accuracy of our financial reporting. We present this information proudly, with the expectation that those who use it will understand our Company, recognize our commitment to performance with integrity and share our confidence in PG's future. /s/ A. G. Lafley A. G. Lafley Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer /s/ Jon R. Moeller Jon R. Moeller Chief Financial Officer The Procter  Gamble Company   45 MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of The Procter  Gamble Company (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Strong internal controls is an objective that is reinforced through our Worldwide Business Conduct Manual , which sets forth our commitment to conduct business with integrity, and within both the letter and the spirit of the law. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes a Control Self-Assessment Program that is conducted annually for critical financial reporting areas of the Company and is audited by the internal audit function. Management takes the appropriate action to correct any identified control deficiencies. Because of its inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, may not prevent or detect misstatements due to the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden or that misstatements due to error or fraud may occur that are not detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2014 , using criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2014 , based on these criteria. Deloitte  Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2014 , as stated in their report which is included herein. /s/ A. G. Lafley A. G. Lafley Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer /s/ Jon R. Moeller Jon R. Moeller Chief Financial Officer August 8, 2014  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Procter  Gamble Company We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2014 and 2013 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Shareholders' Equity and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2014 . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2014 and 2013 , and the results of its operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2014 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2014 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 8, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP Cincinnati, Ohio August 8, 2014  46   The Procter  Gamble Company REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Procter  Gamble Company We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2014 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of and for the year ended June 30, 2014 and our report dated August 8, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP Cincinnati, Ohio August 8, 2014 The Procter  Gamble Company   47 Consolidated Statements of Earnings ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions except per share amounts;

Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through retail operations including mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons, high-frequency stores and e-commerce. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation for amounts related to discontinued operations (see Note 13) and segment reporting (see Note 12). Use of Estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, consumer and trade promotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, post-employment benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets, uncertain income tax positions and contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although management does not generally believe such differences would materially affect the financial statements in any individual year. However, in regard to ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those anticipated at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that materially affect the financial statements in a given year. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned. Revenue transactions represent sales of inventory. The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. The revenue includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to the customer. Our policy is to recognize revenue when title to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period the revenue is recognized. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred, generally at the time of the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in the Accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacture of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product. Cost of products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense (SGA) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items. Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $2.0 billion in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include worldwide television, print, radio, internet and in-store advertising expenses and were $9.2 billion in 2014 , $9.6 billion in 2013 and $9.2 billion in 2012 . Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids, which are included in SGA, as well as coupons and customer trade funds, which are recorded as reductions to net sales. Other Non-Operating Income, Net Other non-operating income, net, primarily includes net acquisition and divestiture gains and investment income. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company   53 Currency Translation Financial statements of operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). Currency translation adjustments in accumulated OCI were gains of $1.4 billion and $353 at June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013 , respectively. For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Re-measurement adjustments for financial statements in highly inflationary economies and other transactional exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. Cash Flow Presentation The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method, which reconciles net earnings to cash flow from operating activities. The reconciliation adjustments include the removal of timing differences between the occurrence of operating receipts and payments and their recognition in net earnings. The adjustments also remove cash flows arising from investing and financing activities, which are presented separately from operating activities. Cash flows from foreign currency transactions and operations are translated at an average exchange rate for the period. Cash flows from hedging activities are included in the same category as the items being hedged. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as financing activities. Realized gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative instruments used to hedge currency exposures resulting from intercompany financing transactions are also classified as financing activities. Cash flows from other derivative instruments used to manage interest, commodity or other currency exposures are classified as operating activities. Cash payments related to income taxes are classified as operating activities. Cash flows from the Company's discontinued operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash Equivalents Highly liquid investments with remaining stated maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents and recorded at cost. Investments Investment securities consist of readily marketable debt and equity securities. Unrealized gains or losses from investments classified as trading, if any, are charged to earnings. Unrealized gains or losses on securities classified as available-for-sale are generally recorded in OCI. If an available-for-sale security is other than temporarily impaired, the loss is charged to either earnings or OCI depending on our intent and ability to retain the security until we recover the full cost basis and the extent of the loss attributable to the creditworthiness of the issuer. Investment securities are included as available-for-sale investment securities and other current assets or other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Investments in certain companies over which we exert significant influence, but do not control the financial and operating decisions, are accounted for as equity method investments. Other investments that are not controlled, and over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method. Both equity and cost method investments are included as other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value. Product-related inventories are primarily maintained on the first-in, first-out method. Minor amounts of product inventories, including certain cosmetics and commodities, are maintained on the last-in, first-out method. The cost of spare part inventories is maintained using the average-cost method. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized over the assets' estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Machinery and equipment includes office furniture and fixtures ( 15 -year life), computer equipment and capitalized software ( 3 - to 5 -year lives) and manufacturing equipment ( 3 - to 20 -year lives). Buildings are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 40 years. Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, when appropriate, changes are made prospectively. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. Our annual impairment testing of goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. The annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is based on valuation models that incorporate assumptions and internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans. We believe such assumptions are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. We have acquired brands that have been determined to have indefinite lives. We evaluate a number of factors to determine whether an indefinite life is appropriate, including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 54   The Procter  Gamble Company indefinite-lived assets may be adjusted to a determinable life. The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology and other intangible assets with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives. Customer relationships, brands and other non-contractual intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over periods generally ranging from 5 to 30 years. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and remaining lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted. Fair Values of Financial Instruments Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Changes in assumptions or estimation methods could affect the fair value estimates; however, we do not believe any such changes would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, other investments and short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair values of long-term debt and financial instruments are disclosed in Note 5. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This guidance outlines a single, comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. We will adopt the standard on July 1, 2017. We are evaluating the impact, if any, that the standard will have on our financial statements. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. NOTE 2 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS The change in the net carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment was as follows: ##TABLE_START  Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric Care and Home Care Baby, Feminine and Family Care Corporate Total Company GOODWILL at JUNE 30, 2012 - Gross $ 16,860 $ 21,579 $ 6,115 $ 4,424 $ 3,684 $ 2,441 $ 55,103 Accumulated impairment losses at June 30, 2012 (431 ) (899 )     (1,330 ) GOODWILL at JUNE 30, 2012 - Net 16,429 20,680 6,115 4,424 3,684 2,441 53,773 Acquisitions and divestitures (21 ) (40 )  (14 ) 1,090  1,015 Goodwill impairment charges  (259 )     (259 ) Translation and other 236 43 1 GOODWILL at JUNE 30, 2013 - Gross 17,094 21,775 6,185 4,453 4,828 2,442 56,777 Accumulated impairment losses at June 30, 2013 (431 ) (1,158 )     (1,589 ) GOODWILL at JUNE 30, 2013 - Net 16,663 20,617 6,185 4,453 4,828 2,442 55,188 Acquisitions and divestitures    (3 )  (2,445 ) (2,448 ) Translation and other 322 85 3 GOODWILL at JUNE 30, 2014 - Gross 17,471 22,097 6,280 4,535 4,910  55,293 Accumulated impairment losses at June 30, 2014 (431 ) (1,158 )     (1,589 ) GOODWILL at JUNE 30, 2014 - Net 17,040 20,939 6,280 4,535 4,910  53,704 ##TABLE_ENDAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company   55 On July 31, 2014, the Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care operations in North America, Latin America and other selected countries. The Company is pursuing alternate plans to sell its Pet Care business in the other markets, primarily the European Union countries. As a result, the Pet Care goodwill is included in the Corporate Segment as of June 30, 2013 and 2012. Pet Care goodwill and intangible assets at June 30, 2014 are reported in assets held for sale. The remaining change in goodwill since June 30, 2013 was primarily due to currency translation across all reportable segments. The results of our goodwill impairment testing during fiscal 2013 determined that the estimated fair value of our Appliances reporting unit declined below its carrying amount. As a result, we recorded a non-cash before and after-tax impairment charge of $259 , in fiscal 2013, to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to estimated fair value. We also recorded a non-cash before-tax impairment charge of $49 ( $31 after-tax) to reduce the carrying amount of our Braun indefinite-lived trade name intangible asset to its fair value. The fiscal 2013 declines in fair values of the Appliances reporting unit and the Braun trade name intangible asset were primarily driven by currency impacts. Specifically, currency in Japan, a country that generates a significant portion of the Appliances earnings, devalued approximately 20% in the second half of fiscal 2013 relative to the currencies in which the underlying net assets are recorded. This sustained reduction in the yen reduced the underlying category market size and the projected future cash flows of the business, which in turn triggered the impairment. In October 2012, the Company acquired our partner's interest in a joint venture in Iberia that operates in our Baby Care and Family Care and Health Care reportable segments. We paid $1.1 billion for our partner's interest and the transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The total enterprise value of $1.9 billion was allocated to indefinite-lived intangible assets of $0.2 billion , defined-life intangible assets of $0.9 billion and goodwill of $1.1 billion . These were partially offset by $0.3 billion of deferred tax liabilities on the intangible assets. The Company recognized a $0.6 billion holding gain on its previously held investment, which was included in other non-operating income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in fiscal 2013. In addition to these items and the impairment discussed above, the remaining net increase in goodwill during fiscal 2013 was primarily due to currency translation across all reportable segments. The results of our goodwill impairment testing during fiscal 2012 determined that the estimated fair values of our Appliances and Salon Professional reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts. As a result, we recorded a non-cash before and after-tax impairment charge of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2012 to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to estimated fair value. $899 of the impairment related to Appliances and $431 related to Salon Professional. Our impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets during fiscal 2012 also indicated a decline in the fair value of our Koleston Perfect and Wella trade name intangible assets below their respective carrying values. This resulted in a non-cash before-tax impairment charge of $246 ( $173 after-tax) to reduce the carrying amounts of these assets to their respective values. The fiscal 2012 declines in the fair values of the Appliances and Salon Professional reporting units and the underlying Koleston Perfect and Wella trade name intangible assets were driven by a combination of competitive and economic factors, which resulted in a reduction in the forecasted growth rates and cash flows used to estimate fair value. All of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges are included in Corporate for segment reporting. The goodwill and intangible asset valuations are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those used in our valuations. To the extent such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows used to estimate fair value, we may need to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future.

Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually. In 2012, the Company initiated an incremental restructuring program as part of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The productivity and cost savings plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the Company's growth strategy. The Company expects to incur in excess of $4.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a five year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2016), including costs incurred as part of the ongoing and incremental restructuring program. Through the end of fiscal 2014, we had incurred $ 2.8 billion of the total expected restructuring charges under the program. The restructuring program plans included a targeted net reduction in non-manufacturing overhead enrollment of approximately 16% - 22% through fiscal 2016, which we expect to exceed. Through fiscal 2014, the Company has reduced non-manufacturing enrollment by approximately 9,300 , or approximately 15% . The reductions are enabled by the elimination of duplicate work, simplification through the use of technology, optimization of various functional and business organizations and the Company's global footprint. In addition, the plan includes integration of newly acquired companies and the optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs as outlined below. The Company incurred total restructuring charges of approximately $ 806 and $ 956 for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Approximately $ 373 and $ 591 of these charges were recorded in SGA for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Approximately $ 399 and $ 354 of these charges were recorded in cost of products sold for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The remainder is included in discontinued operations. Since the inception of this restructuring program, the Company has incurred charges of approximately $ 2.8 billion . Approximately $ 1.5 billion of these charges were related to separations, $ 666 were asset-related and $ 680 were related to other restructuring-type costs.

For the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, these severance packages include approximately 1,640 and 2,390 non-manufacturing employees, respectively. These separations are primarily in North America and Western Europe. The packages are predominantly voluntary and the amounts are calculated based on salary levels and past service periods. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Since its inception, the restructuring program has incurred separation charges related to approximately 9,480 employees, of which approximately 6,280 are non-manufacturing overhead personnel. Asset-Related Costs Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal. These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardization. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other Costs Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program. Such charges primarily include employee relocation related to separations and office consolidations, termination of contracts related to supply chain redesign and the cost to change internal systems and processes to support the underlying organizational changes. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges are funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting. Accordingly, all charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment.

NOTE 5 RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. To the extent we choose to manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions that we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. At inception, we formally designate and document qualifying instruments as hedges of underlying exposures. We formally assess, at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. Fluctuations in the value of these instruments generally are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. This is driven by the high degree of effectiveness between the exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument. The ineffective portion of a change in the fair value of a qualifying instrument is immediately recognized in earnings. The amount of ineffectiveness recognized was immaterial for all years presented. Credit Risk Management We have counterparty credit guidelines and normally enter into transactions with investment grade financial institutions. Counterparty exposures are monitored daily and downgrades in counterparty credit ratings are reviewed on a timely basis. We have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, material credit losses on our risk management or other financial instruments. Substantially all of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company   59 counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position as of June 30, 2014 , was not material. The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features. Interest Rate Risk Management Our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. To manage this risk in a cost-efficient manner, we enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to exchange with the counterparty, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional amount. Interest rate swaps that meet specific accounting criteria are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in interest expense. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument is reported in OCI and reclassified into interest expense over the life of the underlying debt obligation. The ineffective portion for both cash flow and fair value hedges, which was not material for any year presented, was immediately recognized in interest expense. Foreign Currency Risk Management We manufacture and sell our products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world. As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To manage the exchange rate risk primarily associated with our financing operations, we have historically used a combination of forward contracts, options and currency swaps. As of June 30, 2014 , we had currency swaps with maturities up to five years, which are intended to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in OCI and reclassified into SGA and interest expense in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion, which was not material for any year presented, was immediately recognized in SGA. The change in fair values of certain non-qualifying instruments used to manage foreign exchange exposure of intercompany financing transactions and certain balance sheet items subject to revaluation are immediately recognized in earnings, substantially offsetting the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposures. Net Investment Hedging We hedge certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries. To accomplish this, we either borrow directly in foreign currencies and designate all or a portion of the foreign currency debt as a hedge of the applicable net investment position or we enter into foreign currency swaps that are designated as hedges of net investments. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in OCI to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. The ineffective portion of these hedges, which was not material in any year presented, was immediately recognized in interest expense. Commodity Risk Management Certain raw materials used in our products or production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. To manage the volatility related to anticipated purchases of certain of these materials, we have historically, on a limited basis, used futures and options with maturities generally less than one year and swap contracts with maturities up to five years . As of and during the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, we did not have any commodity hedging activity. Insurance We self-insure for most insurable risks. However, we purchase insurance for Directors and Officers Liability and certain other coverage where it is required by law, by contract or deemed to be in the best interest of the Company. Fair Value Hierarchy Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets. When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets or liabilities during the year. Our fair value estimates take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and our counterparties. When active market quotes are not available for financial assets and liabilities, we use industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 60   The Procter  Gamble Company using market-based observable inputs including credit risk, interest rate curves, foreign currency rates and forward and spot prices for currencies. In circumstances where market-based observable inputs are not available, management judgment is used to develop assumptions to estimate fair value. Generally, the fair value of our Level 3 instruments is estimated as the net present value of expected future cash flows based on external inputs. The following table sets forth the Company's financial assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2014 and 2013 that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total June 30        ASSETS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE                Investments:                U.S. government securities $   $   $ 1,631  $ 1,571  $   $   $ 1,631  $ 1,571 Corporate bond securities              Other investments          Derivatives relating to:                Foreign currency hedges            Other foreign currency instruments (1)            Interest rates            Net investment hedges            TOTAL ASSETS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE (2)   2,585  2,182    2,615  2,229          LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE                Derivatives relating to:                Other foreign currency instruments (1)            Interest rates            Net investment hedges              TOTAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE (3)            LIABILITIES NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE                Long-term debt (4) 24,747  22,671  1,682  3,022      26,429  25,693 TOTAL LIABILITIES RECORDED AND NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE 24,747  22,671  1,778  3,171      26,525  25,842 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Other foreign currency instruments are comprised of foreign currency financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other noncurrent assets.

The amortized cost of the U.S. government securities was $1,649 and $1,604 as of June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. All U.S. government securities have contractual maturities between one and five years. The amortized cost of the corporate bond securities was $497 as of June 30, 2014. The amortized cost and fair value of corporate bond securities with maturities of less than a year was $39 as of June 30, 2014. The amortized cost and fair value of corporate bond securities with maturities between one and five years was $458 as of June 30, 2014.

Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. ##TABLE_END The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. During fiscal 2013, the Company transferred long-term debt with a fair value of $455 from Level 1 to Level 2. The transferred instruments represent the Company's outstanding industrial development bonds which are infrequently traded in an observable market. There were no additional transfers between levels during the periods presented. In addition, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.

Exercise prices on options granted have been, and continue to be, set equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of the grant. Since September 2002, the key manager stock option awards granted vest after three years and have a 10 -year life. The key manager stock option awards granted from July 1998 through August 2002 vested after three years and have a 15 -year life. Key managers can elect to receive up to the entire value of their option award in RSUs. Key manager RSUs vest and are settled in shares of common stock five years from the grant date. The awards provided to the Company's directors are in the form of restricted stock and RSUs. In addition to our key manager and director grants, we make other minor stock option and RSU grants to employees for which the terms are not substantially different than those described in the preceding paragraph. In 2011, we implemented a performance stock program (PSP) and granted PSUs to senior level executives. Under this program, the number of PSUs that will vest three years after the respective grant date is based on the Company's performance relative to pre-established performance goals during that three year period. A total of 180 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under stock-based compensation plans approved by shareholders in 2003 and 2009. A total of 27 million shares remain available for grant under the 2003 and 2009 plans. Total stock-based compensation expense for stock option grants was $246 , $249 and $317 for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Total compensation expense for restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs was $114 , $97 and $60 in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for stock options, restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs was $127 , $96 and $102 in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. In calculating the compensation expense for stock options granted, we utilize a binomial lattice-based valuation model. Assumptions utilized in the model, which are evaluated and revised as necessary, to reflect market conditions and experience, were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   Interest rate 0.1-2.8%  0.2-2.0%  0.2-2.1% Weighted average interest rate 2.5 %  1.8 %  1.9 % Dividend yield 3.1 %  2.9 %  2.6 % Expected volatility 15-17%  14-15%  12-18% Weighted average volatility %  %  % Expected life in years 8.2  8.9  8.5 ##TABLE_ENDLattice-based option valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs and those ranges are disclosed in the preceding table. Expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatilities of call options on our stock. We use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination patterns within the valuation model. The expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. A summary of options, RSUs and PSUs outstanding under the plans as of June 30, 2014 , and activity during the year then ended is presented below: ##TABLE_START Options in thousands Options Weighted Avg.

NOTE 9 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN We offer various postretirement benefits to our employees. Defined Contribution Retirement Plans We have defined contribution plans which cover the majority of our U.S. employees, as well as employees in certain other countries. These plans are fully funded. We generally make contributions to participants' accounts based on individual base salaries and years of service. Total global defined contribution expense was $311 , $314 and $353 in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The primary U.S. defined contribution plan (the U.S. DC plan) comprises the majority of the expense for the Company's defined contribution plans. For the U.S. DC plan, the contribution rate is set annually. Total contributions for this plan approximated 15% of total participants' annual wages and salaries in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . We maintain The Procter  Gamble Profit Sharing Trust (Trust) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) to provide a portion of the funding for the U.S. DC plan and other retiree benefits (described below). Operating details of the ESOP are provided at the end of this Note. The fair value of the ESOP Series A shares allocated to participants reduces our cash contribution required to fund the U.S. DC plan. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 66   The Procter  Gamble Company Defined Benefit Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits We offer defined benefit retirement pension plans to certain employees. These benefits relate primarily to local plans outside the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, plans assumed in previous acquisitions covering U.S. employees. We also provide certain other retiree benefits, primarily health care and life insurance, for the majority of our U.S. employees who become eligible for these benefits when they meet minimum age and service requirements. Generally, the health care plans require cost sharing with retirees and pay a stated percentage of expenses, reduced by deductibles and other coverages. These benefits are primarily funded by ESOP Series B shares and certain other assets contributed by the Company. Obligation and Funded Status . The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of these defined benefit plans: ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits (1)  Other Retiree Benefits (2) Years ended June 30    CHANGE IN BENEFIT OBLIGATION        Benefit obligation at beginning of year (3) $ 14,514  $ 13,573  $ 5,289  $ 6,006 Service cost    Interest cost    Participants' contributions    Amendments   (5 )   Actuarial loss/(gain) 1,365   (46 )  (1,022 ) Acquisitions       Special termination benefits    Currency translation and other  (4 )   Benefit payments (540 )  (602 )  (239 )  (234 ) BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT END OF YEAR (3) 17,053  14,514  5,505  5,289 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START CHANGE IN PLAN ASSETS        Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 8,561  7,974  3,553  2,713 Actual return on plan assets    Acquisitions       Employer contributions 1,549    Participants' contributions    Currency translation and other  (77 )     ESOP debt impacts (4)      Benefit payments (540 )  (602 )  (239 )  (234 ) FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AT END OF YEAR 11,098  8,561  3,574  3,553 FUNDED STATUS (5,955 )  (5,953 )  (1,931 )  (1,736 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Primarily non-U.S.-based defined benefit retirement plans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Primarily U.S.-based other postretirement benefit plans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  For the pension benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation.

We determine our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis. These assumptions are weighted to reflect each country that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits. The weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, were as follows (1) : ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits     Discount rate 3.5 %  4.0 %  4.4 %  4.8 % Rate of compensation increase 3.2 %  3.2 %   %   % Health care cost trend rates assumed for next year  %   %  6.8 %  7.3 % Rate to which the health care cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend rate)  %   %  5.0 %  5.0 % Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate N/A  N/A   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Determined as of end of year. ##TABLE_END Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company   69 The weighted average assumptions used to determine net benefit cost recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the years ended June 30, were as follows (2) : ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits       Discount rate 4.0 %  4.2 %  5.3 %  4.8 %  4.3 %  5.7 % Expected return on plan assets 7.2 %  7.3 %  7.4 %  8.3 %  8.3 %  9.2 % Rate of compensation increase 3.2 %  3.3 %  3.5 %   %   %   % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  Determined as of beginning of year and adjusted for acquisitions. ##TABLE_END Several factors are considered in developing the estimate for the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets. For the defined benefit retirement plans, these factors include historical rates of return of broad equity and bond indices and projected long-term rates of return obtained from pension investment consultants. The expected long-term rates of return for plan assets are 8 - 9% for equities and 5 - 6% for bonds. For other retiree benefit plans, the expected long-term rate of return reflects the fact that the assets are comprised primarily of Company stock. The expected rate of return on Company stock is based on the long-term projected return of 8.5% and reflects the historical pattern of returns. Assumed health care cost trend rates could have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other retiree benefit plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: ##TABLE_START  One-Percentage Point Increase  One-Percentage Point Decrease Effect on the total service and interest cost components $  $ (61 ) Effect on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation  (696 ) ##TABLE_ENDPlan Assets . Our investment objective for defined benefit retirement plan assets is to meet the plans' benefit obligations, while minimizing the potential for future required Company plan contributions. The investment strategies focus on asset class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit payments and an appropriate balance of long-term investment return and risk. Target ranges for asset allocations are determined by matching the actuarial projections of the plans' future liabilities and benefit payments with expected long-term rates of return on the assets, taking into account investment return volatility and correlations across asset classes. Plan assets are diversified across several investment managers and are generally invested in liquid funds that are selected to track broad market equity and bond indices. Investment risk is carefully controlled with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and with continual monitoring of investment managers' performance relative to the investment guidelines established with each investment manager. Our target asset allocation for the year ended June 30, 2014 , and actual asset allocation by asset category as of June 30, 2014 and 2013 , were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Target Asset Allocation  Actual Asset Allocation at June 30      Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits Asset Category Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits     Cash %  %  %  %  %  % Debt securities %  %  %  %  %  % Equity securities %  %  %  %  %  % TOTAL %  %  %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDThe following tables set forth the fair value of the Company's plan assets as of June 30, 2014 and 2013 segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy (refer to Note 5 for further discussion on the fair value hierarchy and fair value principles). Common collective funds are valued using the net asset value reported by the managers of the funds and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. Company stock listed as Level 2 in the hierarchy represents preferred shares which are valued based on the value of Company common stock. The majority of our Level 3 pension assets are insurance contracts. Their fair values are based on their cash equivalent or models that project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate curves.

Cash Flows . Management's best estimate of cash requirements and discretionary contributions for the defined benefit retirement plans and other retiree benefit plans for the year ending June 30, 2015, is $266 and $39 , respectively. For the defined benefit retirement plans, this is comprised of $102 in expected benefit payments from the Company directly to participants of unfunded plans and $164 of expected contributions to funded plans. For other retiree benefit plans, this is comprised of $ 25 in expected benefit payments from the Company directly to participants of unfunded plans and $ 14 of expected contributions to funded plans. Expected contributions are dependent on many variables, including the variability of the market value of the plan assets as compared to the benefit obligation and other market or regulatory conditions. In addition, we take into consideration our business investment opportunities and resulting cash requirements. Accordingly, actual funding may differ significantly from current estimates. Total benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which include payments funded from the Company's assets, as discussed above, as well as payments from the plans, are as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ending June 30 Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS $  $ 2016  2017  2018  2019  2020 - 2024 3,615  1,528 ##TABLE_ENDEmployee Stock Ownership Plan We maintain the ESOP to provide funding for certain employee benefits discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The ESOP borrowed $1.0 billion in 1989 and the proceeds were used to purchase Series A ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the U.S. DC plan. Principal and interest requirements of the borrowing were paid by the Trust from dividends on the preferred shares and from advances provided by the Company. The original borrowing of $1.0 billion has been repaid in full, and advances from the Company of $98 remain outstanding at June 30, 2014 . Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock. The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $2.45 per share. The liquidation value is $6.82 per share. In 1991, the ESOP borrowed an additional $1.0 billion . The proceeds were used to purchase Series B ESOP Convertible Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company   71 Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of retiree health care benefits. These shares, net of the ESOP's debt, are considered plan assets of the other retiree benefits plan discussed above. Debt service requirements are funded by preferred stock dividends, cash contributions and advances provided by the Company, of which $602 is outstanding at June 30, 2014 . Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock. The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $2.45 per share. The liquidation value is $12.96 per share. Our ESOP accounting practices are consistent with current ESOP accounting guidance, including the permissible continuation of certain provisions from prior accounting guidance. ESOP debt, which is guaranteed by the Company, is recorded as debt (see Note 4) with an offset to the reserve for ESOP debt retirement, which is presented within shareholders' equity. Advances to the ESOP by the Company are recorded as an increase in the reserve for ESOP debt retirement. Interest incurred on the ESOP debt is recorded as interest expense. Dividends on all preferred shares, net of related tax benefits, are charged to retained earnings. The series A and B preferred shares of the ESOP are allocated to employees based on debt service requirements, net of advances made by the Company to the Trust. The number of preferred shares outstanding at June 30 was as follows: ##TABLE_START Shares in thousands   Allocated 44,465  45,535  50,668 Unallocated 8,474  9,843  11,348 TOTAL SERIES A 52,939  55,378  62,016     Allocated 22,085  21,278  20,802 Unallocated 35,753  37,300  38,743 TOTAL SERIES B 57,838  58,578  59,545 ##TABLE_ENDFor purposes of calculating diluted net earnings per common share, the preferred shares held by the ESOP are considered converted from inception. NOTE 10 INCOME TAXES Income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current year and for the impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which represent future tax consequences of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using the enacted statutory tax rates and are adjusted for any changes in such rates in the period of change. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30    United States  $ 9,005  $ 8,260  $ 7,398 International  5,880  6,432  5,130 TOTAL  14,885  14,692  12,528 ##TABLE_ENDIncome taxes on continuing operations consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   CURRENT TAX EXPENSE      U.S. federal $ 1,606  $ 1,845  $ 1,837 International 1,379  1,567  1,357 U.S. state and local    3,222  3,691  3,440 DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE      U.S. federal   International and other (179 )  (485 )  (148 )  (44 )  (300 )  (62 ) TOTAL TAX EXPENSE 3,178  3,391  3,378 ##TABLE_ENDA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to our actual income tax rate on continuing operations is provided below: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   U.S. federal statutory income tax rate 35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % Country mix impacts of foreign operations (10.9 )%  (7.7 )%  (8.2 )% Changes in uncertain tax positions (1.5 )%  (1.8 )%  (1.3 )% Impairment adjustments  %  0.6 %  3.8 % Holding gain on joint venture buy-out  %  (1.4 )%   % Other (1.2 )%  (1.6 )%  (2.3 )% EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE 21.4 %  23.1 %  27.0 % ##TABLE_ENDChanges in uncertain tax positions represent changes in our net liability related to prior year tax positions. Tax benefits to shareholders' equity totaled $716 for the year ended June 30, 2014. This primarily relates to the tax effects of net investment hedges, excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and the impacts of certain adjustments to pension and other retiree benefit obligations recorded in shareholders' equity. Tax costs charged to shareholders' equity totaled $503 for the year ended June 30, 2013. This primarily relates to the impact of certain adjustments to pension obligations recorded in shareholders' equity, partially offset by excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. We have undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $44.0 billion at June 30, 2014 , for which deferred taxes have not been provided. Such earnings are Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 72   The Procter  Gamble Company considered indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiaries. If such earnings were repatriated, additional tax expense may result. However, the calculation of the amount of deferred U.S. income tax on these earnings is not practicable because of the large number of assumptions necessary to compute the tax. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for uncertain tax positions is as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   BEGINNING OF YEAR $ 1,600  $ 1,773  $ 1,848 Increases in tax positions for prior years   Decreases in tax positions for prior years (296 )  (225 )  (188 ) Increases in tax positions for current year   Settlements with taxing authorities (135 )  (195 )  (49 ) Lapse in statute of limitations (33 )  (98 )  (81 ) Currency translation  (5 )  (101 ) END OF YEAR 1,437  1,600  1,773 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company is present in approximately 140 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 50-60 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statute of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. The Company is making a concerted effort to bring its audit inventory to a more current position. We have done this by working with tax authorities to conduct audits for several open years at once. We have tax years open ranging from 2002 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit. While we do not expect material changes, it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to our uncertain tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months related to the audits described above. At this time, we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of uncertain tax positions or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items. Included in the total liability for uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2014 , is $1.1 billion that, depending on the ultimate resolution, could impact the effective tax rate in future periods. Accounting pronouncements require that, without discretion, we recognize the additional accrual of any possible related interest and penalties relating to the underlying uncertain tax position in income tax expense, unless the Company qualifies for a specific exception. As of June 30, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , we had accrued interest of $411 , $413 and $439 and accrued penalties of $32 , $34 and $66 , respectively, that are not included in the above table. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , we recognized $(6) , $24 and $2 in interest benefit/(expense) and $2 , $32 and $10 in penalties benefit, respectively. The net benefits recognized resulted primarily from the favorable resolution of tax positions for prior years. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities were comprised of the following: ##TABLE_START June 30  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS    Pension and postretirement benefits $ 2,045  $ 1,777 Stock-based compensation 1,060  1,125 Loss and other carryforwards 1,211  1,062 Goodwill and other intangible assets  Accrued marketing and promotion  Fixed assets  Unrealized loss on financial and foreign exchange transactions  Accrued interest and taxes  Inventory  Other  Valuation allowances (384 )  (341 ) TOTAL 5,616  5,367    DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES    Goodwill and other intangible assets $ 11,428  $ 11,941 Fixed assets 1,665  1,718 Other  TOTAL 13,237  13,974 ##TABLE_ENDNet operating loss carryforwards were $3.6 billion and $3.1 billion at June 30, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

NOTE 11 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Guarantees In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may provide routine indemnifications (e.g., indemnification for representations and warranties and retention of previously existing environmental, tax and employee liabilities) for which terms range in duration and, in some circumstances, are not explicitly defined. The maximum obligation under some indemnifications is also not explicitly stated and, as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Other Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company   73 than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss on any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In certain situations, we guarantee loans for suppliers and customers. The total amount of guarantees issued under such arrangements is not material. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that have a material impact on our financial statements. Purchase Commitments and Operating Leases We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations are as follows:  ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30      Thereafter Purchase obligations $ 1,068  $  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDSuch amounts represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing. Approximately 19% of our purchase commitments relate to service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced to third-party suppliers. Due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination. We do not expect to incur penalty payments under these provisions that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We also lease certain property and equipment for varying periods. Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases, net of guaranteed sublease income, are as follows:  ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30      Thereafter Operating leases $  $  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDLitigation We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters such as antitrust, trade and other governmental regulations, product liability, patent and trademark matters, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, labor and employments matters and income and other taxes. As previously disclosed, the Company has had a number of antitrust matters in Europe. These matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. Several regulatory authorities in Europe have issued separate decisions pursuant to their investigations alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in those countries. Many of these matters have concluded and the fines have been paid. For ongoing matters, the Company has accrued liabilities for competition law violations totaling $225 as of June 30, 2014. While the ultimate resolution of these matters may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts reserved, we do not expect any such incremental losses to materially impact our financial statements in the period in which they are accrued and paid, respectively. With respect to other litigation and claims, while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. NOTE 12 SEGMENT INFORMATION Effective July 1, 2013, we reorganized our Global Business Unit (GBU) structure, which resulted in changes to our reporting segments. We reorganized our GBUs into four industry-based sectors, comprised of 1) Global Beauty, 2) Global Health and Grooming, 3) Global Fabric and Home Care and 4) Global Baby, Feminine and Family Care. In April 2014, we announced our decision to exit our Pet Care business. On July 31, 2014, the Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care operations in North America, Latin America and other selected markets. The Company is pursuing alternate plans to sell its Pet Care business in the other markets, primarily the European Union countries. This GBU is reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. Under U.S. GAAP, the remaining GBUs underlying the four sectors are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric Care and Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine and Family Care. As a result of the organizational changes, Feminine Care transitioned from Health Care to Baby, Feminine and Family Care for all periods presented. Our five reportable segments are comprised of: ##TABLE_START  Beauty : Beauty Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Cosmetics, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); Hair Care and Color; Prestige (SKII, Fragrances); Salon Professional; ##TABLE_END Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 74   The Procter  Gamble Company ##TABLE_START  Grooming : Shave Care (Blades and Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products); Appliances; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Health Care : Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Other Personal Health Care, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements); Oral Care (Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Fabric Care and Home Care : Fabric Care (Laundry Additives, Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, Surface Care); Personal Power (Batteries); Professional; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Baby, Feminine and Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Feminine Care, Incontinence); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper). ##TABLE_END The accounting policies of the segments are generally the same as those described in Note 1. Differences between these policies and U.S. GAAP primarily reflect income taxes, which are reflected in the segments using applicable blended statutory rates. Adjustments to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate. Previously, we also had a difference in the treatment of certain unconsolidated investees. Certain unconsolidated investees that are managed as integral parts of our businesses were reflected as consolidated subsidiaries in management reporting and segment results, with full recognition of the individual income statement line items through before-tax earnings. Eliminations to adjust these line items to U.S. GAAP were included in Corporate. In determining after-tax earnings for the businesses, we eliminated the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest, and applied statutory tax rates. During the final quarter of fiscal 2014, we changed our management accounting for unconsolidated investees within our segments, which had no impact to our consolidated financial statements. Pursuant to this change, segment results no longer include full recognition of the individual income statement line items of unconsolidated investees, and resulting eliminations of such amounts are no longer included in corporate. All periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities that are not reflected in the operating results used internally to measure and evaluate the businesses, as well as items to adjust management reporting principles to U.S. GAAP. Operating activities in Corporate include the results of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Operating elements also include certain employee benefit costs, the costs of certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization, and other general Corporate items. The non-operating elements in Corporate primarily include interest expense, certain acquisition and divestiture gains and interest and investing income. Total assets for the reportable segments include those assets managed by the reportable segment, primarily inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets. Other assets, primarily including cash, accounts receivable, investment securities and goodwill, are included in Corporate. Our business units are comprised of similar product categories. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, nine business units individually accounted for 5% or more of consolidated net sales as follows:  ##TABLE_START  % of Sales by Business Unit Years ended June 30   Fabric Care 20%  20%  20% Baby Care 13%  13%  13% Hair Care and Color 11%  11%  12% Shave Care 9%  9%  9% Beauty Care 7%  7%  7% Home Care 7%  7%  7% Family Care 7%  7%  6% Oral Care 7%  6%  6% Feminine Care 5%  5%  5% All Other 14%  15%  15% Total 100%  100%  100% ##TABLE_ENDThe Company had net sales in the U.S. of $29.4 billion , $29.2 billion and $28.4 billion for the years ended June 30, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Long-lived assets in the U.S. totaled $8.7 billion and $9.1 billion as of June 30, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Long-lived assets consists of property, plant and equipment. No other country's net sales or long-lived assets exceed 10% of the Company totals. Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 14% of consolidated net sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012.

Under the terms of the agreement, Mars acquired our branded pet care products, our manufacturing facilities in the United States and the majority of the employees working in the Pet Care business. The agreement includes an option for Mars to acquire the Pet Care business in several additional countries. The one-time earnings impact from the divestiture is not expected to be material and will be reflected in fiscal 2015 results. The European Union countries are not included in the agreement with Mars. The Company is pursuing alternate plans to sell its Pet Care business in these markets. The Pet Care business had historically been part of the Companys Health Care reportable segment. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Pet Care business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.

Under the terms of the agreement, Kellogg acquired our branded snacks products, our manufacturing facilities in Belgium and the United States and the majority of the employees working on the snacks business. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the transaction of $ 1.4 billion , which is included in net earnings from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the year ended June 30, 2012.

This plan was approved by the Company's Board of Directors on February 14, 1997. Although the plan has not been submitted to shareholders for approval, it is nearly identical to The Procter  Gamble 1992 Stock Plan, approved by the Company's shareholders on October 13, 1992, except for a few minor changes designed to comply with the Belgian tax laws. The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate key Belgian employees. Under the plan, eligible participants were: (i) granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii) granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii) granted shares of the Company's common stock. Except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights must vest in no less than one year from the date of grant and must expire no later than fifteen years from the date of grant. The exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan is the average price of the Company's stock on the date of grant. If a recipient of a grant leaves the Company while holding an unexercised option or right, any unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, and any exercisable portions become void within one month of departure, except in the case of death or retirement. Any common stock awarded under the plan may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the committee administering the plan may determine. The Procter  Gamble Future Shares Plan On October 14, 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved The Procter  Gamble Future Shares Plan pursuant to which options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock may be granted to employees worldwide. The purpose of this plan is to advance the interests of the Company by giving substantially all employees a stake in the Company's future growth and success and to strengthen the alignment of interests between employees and the Company's shareholders through increased ownership of shares of the Company's stock. The plan has not been submitted to shareholders for approval. Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company's capitalization, the number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 17 million shares. Under the plan's regulations, recipients are granted options to acquire 100 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price equal to the average price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant. These options vest five years after the date of grant and expire ten years following the date of grant. If a recipient leaves the employ of the Company prior to the vesting date for a reason other than disability, retirement or special separation (as defined in the plan), then the award is forfeited. At the time of the first grant following Board approval of the plan, each employee of the Company not eligible for an award under the 1992 Stock Plan was granted options for 100 shares. From the date of this first grant through June 30, 2003, each new employee of the Company has also received options for 100 shares. Following the grant of options on June 30, 2003, the Company suspended this part of the plan. The plan terminated on October 13, 2007. The Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan Shareholders of The Gillette Company approved The Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan on May 20, 2004, and the plan was assumed by the Company upon the merger between The Procter  Gamble Company and The Gillette Company. All options became immediately vested and exercisable on October 1, 2005 as a result of the merger. After the merger, all outstanding options became options to purchase shares of The Procter  Gamble Company subject to an exchange ratio of .975 shares of PG stock per share of Gillette stock. Only employees previously employed by The Gillette Company prior to October 1, 2005 are eligible to receive grants under this plan. The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate employees of The Gillette Company and, until the effective date of the merger between The Gillette Company and The Procter  Gamble Company, non-employee members of the Gillette Board of Directors. Under the plan, eligible participants are: (i) granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii) granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii) granted shares of the Company's common stock or restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents). Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company's capitalization and the addition of any shares authorized but not issued or redeemed under The Gillette Company 1971 Stock Option Plan, the number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 19,000,000 shares. Except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights must expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan must be equal to or greater than the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of grant. Any common stock awarded under the plan may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the committee administering the plan may determine.  If a recipient of a grant leaves the Company while holding an unexercised option or right: (1) any unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement, special separation (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has waived the termination provisions; and (2) any exercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of The Procter  Gamble Company   81 death, retirement, special separation, voluntary resignation that is not for Good Reason (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has waived the termination provisions.

Many of the factors necessary for understanding these businesses are similar. Operating margins of the individual businesses vary due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products, the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. Net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets and product categories in which they operate. While none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components within certain reportable segments, such as Appliances (Grooming) and Prestige Fragrances (Beauty, Hair and Personal Care) are seasonal. Additional information about our reportable segments can be found in the MDA and Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Narrative Description of Business Business Model . Our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products, as well as the creation of new products. The markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We utilize our superior marketing and online presence to win with consumers at the \"zero moment of truth\" - when they are searching for information about a brand or product. We work collaboratively with our customers to improve the in-store presence of our products and win the \"first moment of truth\" - when a consumer is shopping in the store. We must also win the \"second moment of truth\" - when a consumer uses the product, evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and decides whether it was a good value. We believe we must continue to provide new, innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business. Research and product development activities, designed to enable sustained organic growth, continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year. While many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years, we believe these activities demonstrate our commitment to future growth. Key Product Categories . Information on key product categories can be found in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Key Customers . Our customers include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons, distributors, e-commerce and high-frequency stores. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 14% of our total revenue in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . No other customer represents more than 10% of our net sales. Our top ten customers account for approximately 33% of our total sales in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . The nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government. We believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete. Sources and Availability of Materials . Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from others, some of which are single-source suppliers. We produce certain raw materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing process and in the distribution of input materials and finished product to customers. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers. The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, none of which is material to our business taken as a whole. Trademarks and Patents . We own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes 13 The Procter  Gamble Company used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. All major trademarks in each business are registered. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses. Competitive Condition . The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. We support our products with advertising, promotions and other marketing vehicles to build awareness and trial of our brands and products in conjunction with an extensive sales force. We believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products. Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important differentiating factors. Research and Development Expenditures . Research and development expenditures enable us to develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of our consumers. Total research and development expenses were $2.0 billion in 2015 and 2014 and $1.9 billion in 2013 . Expenditures for Environmental Compliance .  Expenditures for compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not material to the Company. No material change is expected in fiscal year 2016 . Employees . Total number of employees is an estimate of total Company employees excluding interns, co-ops and employees of joint ventures as of the years ended June 30. The number of employees includes manufacturing and non-manufacturing employees. A discussion of progress on non-manufacturing enrollment objectives is included in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The number of employees includes employees of discontinued operations. ##TABLE_START  Total Number of Employees 110,000 118,000 121,000 126,000 129,000 127,000 ##TABLE_ENDFinancial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations. Net sales in the U.S. account for approximately 37% of total net sales. No other individual country exceeds 10% of total net sales. Operations outside the U.S. are generally characterized by the same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may be affected by additional factors including changing currency values, different rates of inflation, economic growth and political and economic uncertainties and disruptions.

Risk Factors. We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-K, quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. The following discussion of risk factors identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with the MDA and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes incorporated in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. The Procter  Gamble Company 14 Our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility. We are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world. We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our operations outside the U.S. generate a significant portion of our net revenue. Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies, such as the recent volatility in the Russian ruble, may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in U.S. dollars) in those markets, or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition. Moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies in different countries could adversely affect our results. See also the Results of Operations and Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity sections of the MDA and Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls, including Argentina, China, Egypt, Greece, India, Nigeria, Ukraine and Venezuela. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business outside the U.S., such as the current year impact of deconsolidating our Venezuelan subsidiaries as discussed in this Form 10-K. Additionally, our business, operations or employees may be affected by political volatility, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval, broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments, particularly in emerging markets, which could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations. Uncertain global economic conditions, including disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit rating, may adversely impact demand for our products, cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship or reduce our access to credit, all of which could adversely impact our business. Our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic disruptions, such as: a slow-down in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers; or the inability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. Additionally, economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third party partners to suffer financial difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles. If we are unable to generate sufficient income and cash flow, it could affect the Companys ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments. A disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. Disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results. Our ability to meet our customers needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of our previously-announced supply chain simplifications and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. The loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare. Therefore, our business results are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. In addition, our financial projections include cost savings described in our announced productivity plan. Failure to manage these fluctuations and deliver the planned cost savings could adversely impact our financial results. Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation . We are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. Achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. The success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid 15 The Procter  Gamble Company infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. We must also be able to successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors. Failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels. The consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. This includes, among other things, increasing competition from mid- and lower-tier value products, including private-label products, in both developed and developing markets. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms. In addition, the emergence of new sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and effectively compete in new sales channels could negatively impact our results. A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons, distributors, e-commerce and high-frequency stores. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued consolidation among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of our products or experience a significant business disruption. If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. The Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition, and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, efficacy or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer. Our Company also devotes significant time and resources to programs that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. If these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, the Company's reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. Due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners or external business partners, for certain functions. If we are unable to effectively manage our third party relationships and the agreements under which our third party partners operate, our financial results could suffer. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. A breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, hardware, processes, associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. We rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems, networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. The various uses of these IT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: ##TABLE_START  ordering and managing materials from suppliers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  converting materials to finished products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  shipping products to customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  marketing and selling products to consumers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  collecting, transmitting, transferring and storing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  summarizing and reporting results of operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements; ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company 16 ##TABLE_START  providing data security; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  handling other processes necessary to manage our business. ##TABLE_END Numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our IT systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. As cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally, the Company is continually increasing its sensitivity and attention to these threats. We continue to assess potential threats and make investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems and upgrading skills, employee training and security policies for the Company and its third-party providers. However, because the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. Our IT systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other cyber-attacks. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks; however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns to our or our third-party providers databases or systems. If the IT systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss, significant unavailability of or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. The costs and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. We must successfully manage compliance with legislation, regulation and enforcement, as well as pending legal matters in the U.S. and abroad. Our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across all of the countries in which we do business, including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property, product liability, marketing, antitrust, privacy, environmental, employment, anti-bribery or anti-corruption (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) or other matters. Rapidly changing laws, regulations and related interpretations, including changes in accounting standards, as well as increased enforcement actions, create challenges for our compliance and ethics programs and may alter the environment in which we do business. If we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. Failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. Furthermore, if pending legal matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Changes in applicable tax regulations could negatively affect our financial results. The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Because the U.S. maintains a worldwide corporate tax system, the foreign and U.S. tax systems are somewhat interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the U.S. is not taxed in the U.S., provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. If those same foreign earnings are instead repatriated to the U.S., additional residual U.S. taxation will likely occur, due to the U.S.s worldwide tax system and higher U.S. corporate tax rate. The U.S. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly change the corporate tax rate and the U.S. international tax rules. Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each countrys jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving ,  such as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (BEPS\") currently being undertaken by the G8, G20, and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\"OECD\"). As these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results. If we are unable to successfully execute our portfolio optimization strategy, as well as successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities, it could adversely impact our business. In August 2014, the Company announced a plan to significantly streamline our product portfolio by divesting, discontinuing or consolidating about 100 non-strategic brands, resulting in a portfolio of about 65 brands. The Company has announced a series of transactions that will substantially complete this plan. It will take time to execute this plan, and our ability to successfully do so could impact our results. In addition, as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands. Our financial results could also be impacted in the event of acquisitions or joint venture activities if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets. 17 The Procter  Gamble Company Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change. Our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement, including those described in our announced productivity plan and our portfolio-optimization strategy. If we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. We expect these types of changes, which will include staffing adjustments as well as employee departures, to continue for the foreseeable future. Successfully executing these changes, including effective management transitions at leadership levels of the Company and retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. We are generally a build-from-within company and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense. It also includes continued development and execution of robust leadership succession plans, including successful execution of our recently announced CEO transition. ", "1B": " Item 1B.

In addition, we own and operate 100 manufacturing sites in 38 other countries. Many of the domestic and international sites manufacture products for multiple businesses.

Management believes that the Company's manufacturing sites are adequate to support the business and that the properties and equipment have been well maintained. ", "3": " Item 3. Legal Proceedings. On February 10, 2015, the Sacramento County Environmental Management Department (Sacramento EMD) issued an Administrative Enforcement Order to The Procter  Gamble Manufacturing Company, a subsidiary of the Company, alleging violations of Californias hazardous waste management regulations at the subsidiarys facility in Sacramento, California. On May 26, 2015, the subsidiary and Sacramento EMD agreed to a Final Stipulation and Order that includes no admission of liability, a release of all claims against the subsidiary, a $200,000 fine assessed against the subsidiary, and an agreement by the subsidiary to make certain plant modifications and have a third party conduct an integrity assessment of certain hazardous waste systems at its Sacramento, California facility. On August 25, 2014, Procuradura Federal de Proteccin al Ambiente (PROFEPA) issued a ruling to Procter  Gamble Manufactura, S. de R.L. de C.V. (Planta Vallejo), a subsidiary of the Company, citing violations of Mexicos air emissions regulations at the subsidiarys facility in Zona Industrial Vallejo, Mexico City, Mexico and requiring the subsidiary to perform certain corrective measures at the facility, most of which have been completed. On June 15, 2015, PROFEPA issued a final ruling to the subsidiary imposing monetary sanctions of $133,000. The proceedings are still pending as PROFEPA reviews compliance with additional terms of the subsidiarys environmental licenses. The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain other legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax.

The following Management's Discussion and Analysis (MDA) is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of PG's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MDA is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MDA is organized in the following sections: ##TABLE_START  Overview ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Summary of 2015 Results ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Economic Conditions and Uncertainties ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Results of Operations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Segment Results ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Information ##TABLE_END Throughout the MDA, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain specified charges and gains. Free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending. Adjusted free cash flow is free cash flow excluding tax payments for the Pet Care divestiture. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding impairment charges on the Batteries business and the Venezuelan deconsolidation charge. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of the MDA provides more details on the use and derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MDA are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category and are measured on an annual basis versus the prior 12-month period. References to competitive activity include promotional and product initiatives from our competitors. OVERVIEW PG is a global leader in fast-moving consumer goods, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons, distributors, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. 23 The Procter  Gamble Company ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE Our organizational structure is comprised of Global Business Units (GBUs), Selling and Market Operations (SMOs), Global Business Services (GBS) and Corporate Functions (CF). Global Business Units Our Global Business Units (GBUs) are organized into four industry-based sectors, comprised of 1) Global Beauty, 2) Global Health and Grooming, 3) Global Fabric and Home Care and 4) Global Baby, Feminine and Family Care. Under U.S. GAAP, the GBUs underlying the four sectors are aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty, Hair and Personal Care ; Grooming ; Health Care ; Fabric Care and Home Care ; and Baby, Feminine and Family Care . The GBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the key product categories and brand composition within each segment. ##TABLE_START Reportable Segment % of Net Sales* % of Net Earnings* GBUs (Categories) Billion Dollar Brands Beauty, Hair and Personal Care 24% 23% Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); Cosmetics; Hair Care and Color; Prestige; Salon Professional Head  Shoulders, Olay, Pantene, SK-II, Wella Grooming 10% 16% Shave Care (Female Blades  Razors, Male Blades  Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care); Electronic Hair Removal Fusion, Gillette, Mach3, Prestobarba Health Care 10% 11% Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care); Oral Care (Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care) Crest, Oral-B, Vicks Fabric Care and Home Care 29% 24% Fabric Care (Laundry Additives, Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, PG Professional, Surface Care) Ariel, Dawn, Downy, Febreze, Gain, Tide Baby, Feminine and Family Care 27% 26% Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper) Always, Bounty, Charmin, Pampers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Percent of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2015 (excluding results held in Corporate). ##TABLE_END Recent Developments: As of June 30, 2015, the Company deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. This change resulted in a fourth quarter fiscal 2015 one-time after-tax charge of $2.1 billion ($0.71 per share). In future periods, our financial results will only include sales of finished goods to our Venezuela subsidiaries to the extent we receive cash payments from Venezuela (expected to be largely through the CENCOEX exchange market). Accordingly, we will no longer include the results of our local Venezuelan subsidiaries' operations in future reporting periods (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and additional discussion in this MDA under \"Venezuela Impacts\" in Results of Operations). In August 2014, the Company announced a plan to significantly streamline our product portfolio by divesting, discontinuing or consolidating about 100 non-strategic brands. The resulting portfolio of about 65 key brands will retain about 85% of sales and 95% of before-tax profit. On July 9, 2015, the Company announced the signing of a definitive agreement with Coty, Inc. to divest four product categories, including 43 of its beauty brands to Coty Inc. Coty's offer was $12.5 billion. While the final value of the transaction will be determined at closing, based on Coty's stock price and outstanding shares and equity grants as of the date of signing, the value of the transaction was approximately $15.0 billion. While the ultimate form of the transaction has not yet been decided, the Companys current preference is for a Reverse Morris Trust split-off transaction in which PG shareholders could elect to participate in an exchange offer to exchange PG shares for Coty shares. The transaction includes PGs global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance categories, along with select hair styling brands, all of which have historically been part of the Company's Beauty, Hair and Personal Care reportable segment and had net sales of $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2015. The Company expects to complete this beauty transaction by the end of calendar year 2016. For the period ended June 30, 2015, the results of the affected beauty categories and brands remain part of our continuing operations. Beginning with fiscal year 2015-16 reported results, the earnings, assets and liabilities from the affected beauty businesses will be reported as discontinued operations. On November 13, 2014, the Company announced that it plans to divest the Batteries business via a split transaction with Berkshire Hathaway valued at $2.9 billion, in which it will exchange a recapitalized Duracell Company for Berkshire Hathaways shares of Procter  Gamble stock. The Company had previously sold its controlling interest in a China-based batteries joint venture, which represented the balance of the The Procter  Gamble Company 24 Companys Batteries business, during the quarter ended December 31, 2014. The Company expects to complete the Duracell transaction in the beginning of calendar year 2016, pending necessary regulatory approvals. The Batteries business had historically been part of the Companys Fabric Care and Home Care reportable segment. The results of the Batteries business are now presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Additionally, the Batteries balance sheet positions as of June 30, 2015 are presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During fiscal 2015, the Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care business. The gain on the transaction was not material. The results of the Pet Care business are now presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Additionally, the Pet Care balance sheet positions as of June 30, 2014 are presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. With these transactions and other recently completed and announced minor brand divestitures, the Company will have substantially completed the strategic portfolio reshaping program with 93 out of approximately 100 brands having been sold, discontinued or consolidated. Beauty, Hair and Personal Care : We are a global market leader in the beauty category. Most of the beauty markets in which we compete are highly fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. We compete in beauty care, hair care and color and prestige. In beauty care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to cosmetics to skin care, such as our Olay brand, which is the top facial skin care brand in the world with over 8% global market share. In hair care and color, we compete in both the retail and salon professional channels. We are the global market leader in the retail hair care and color market with over 20% global market share primarily behind our Pantene and Head  Shoulders brands. In the prestige channel, we compete primarily with our prestige fragrances behind Dolce  Gabbana, Gucci and Hugo Boss fragrance brands and the SK-II brand. Grooming : We are the global market leader in the blades and razors market. Our global blades and razors market share is over 65%, primarily behind the Gillette franchise including Fusion, Mach3, Prestobarba and Venus. Our electronic hair removal devices, such as electric razors and epilators, are sold under the Braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. We hold over 20% of the male shavers market and nearly 50% of the female epilators market. Health Care : We compete in oral care and personal health care. In oral care, there are several global competitors in the market and we have the number two market share position with approximately 20% global market share. In personal health care, we are a top ten competitor in a large, highly fragmented industry behind respiratory treatments (Vicks brand) and nonprescription heartburn medications (Prilosec OTC brand). Nearly all of our sales outside the U.S. in personal health care are generated through the PGT Healthcare partnership with Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Fabric Care and Home Care : This segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products including laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; and home care products including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners. In fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader with approximately 30% global market share, primarily behind our Tide, Ariel and Downy brands. Our global home care market share is approximately 20% across the categories in which we compete. Baby, Feminine and Family Care : In baby care, we compete mainly in diapers, pants and baby wipes with over 30% global market share. We are the number one or number two baby care competitor in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind Pampers, the Company's largest brand, with annual net sales of approximately $10 billion. We are the global market leader in the feminine care category with approximately 30% global market share, primarily behind Always. We have recently entered the adult incontinence category in certain markets, achieving nearly a 10% market share in those markets where we have entered. Our family care business is predominantly a North American business comprised largely of the Bounty paper towel and Charmin toilet paper brands. U.S. market shares are nearly 45% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin. Selling and Market Operations Our SMOs are responsible for developing and executing go-to-market plans at the local level. The SMOs include dedicated retail customer, trade channel and country-specific teams. Our SMOs are organized under six regions comprised of North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Greater China and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA). Throughout the MDA, we reference business results in developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan, and developing markets which are all other markets not included in developed. Global Business Services GBS provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the GBUs and the SMOs to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment. Corporate Functions CF provides Company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources and legal, as well as other centralized functional support. STRATEGIC FOCUS We are focused on strategies that we believe are right for the long-term health of the Company with the objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. Our value creation progress is measured internally with the operating total shareholder return (O-TSR) model. Over time, 25 The Procter  Gamble Company O-TSR performance is highly correlated with market total shareholder returns. O-TSR is a balanced measure that requires strong performance across the three primary drivers of value creation: sales growth, profit margin expansion and efficient utilization of assets to generate strong, reliable operating cash flow. We operationalize O-TSR deep within the Company by defining tight linkages between business activities and the key drivers of value creation, from strategic choices of global business units, brands and country teams down to individual employees daily work plans. The Company has recently undertaken an effort to focus and strengthen its business portfolio to compete in categories and brands that are structurally attractive and that play to PG strengths. This will enable us to allocate resources to leading brands - marketed in the right set of countries, channels and customers - where the size of the prize and probability of winning is highest. When the major portion of this work is complete, we expect to compete in four industry-based sectors made up of approximately ten product categories and 65 leading brands. Innovation has always been - and continues to be - PG's lifeblood. To consistently win with consumers around the world across price tiers and preferences and to consistently win versus our best competitors, each PG product category needs a full portfolio of innovation, including a mix of commercial programs, product improvements and game-changing innovations. We are also innovating to improve our category, brand and market business models to better serve consumers and customers. Productivity is a core strength for PG, which creates flexibility to fund our growth efforts, offset cost challenges and/or improve operating margins. We have taken significant steps to accelerate productivity and savings across all elements of costs, including cost of goods sold, marketing expense and non-manufacturing overhead. These efforts are yielding significant benefits to our operating margin. Finally, we are focused on improving execution and operating discipline in everything we do. Operating discipline and execution have always been - and must continue to be - core capabilities and competitive advantages for PG. The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term annual financial targets will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive peer group: ##TABLE_START  Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Core EPS growth of high single digits; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater. ##TABLE_END In periods with significant macroeconomic pressures, we will maintain a disciplined approach to investing so as not to sacrifice the long-term health of our businesses to meet short-term objectives in any given year.

Volume decreased low single digits in Baby, Feminine and Family Care, Grooming and Health Care, and declined mid-single digits in Beauty, Hair and Personal Care. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net earnings from continuing operations decreased $2.4 billion or 21% due to a $2.1 billion after tax charge related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries and the decline in net sales, partially offset by reduced selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA). Foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately 12%. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $2.3 billion due primarily to impairment charges in our Batteries business, which is included in discontinued operations due to the pending divestiture. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble were $7.0 billion, a decrease of $4.6 billion or 40% versus the prior year period due primarily to the Venezuelan deconsolidation charge and impairment charges in our Batteries business. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted net earnings per share decreased 39% to $2.44 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 21% to $3.06. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Core EPS decreased 2% to $4.02. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash flow from operating activities was $14.6 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adjusted free cash flow was $11.6 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 102%. ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company 26 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are \"forward-looking statements\" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in this 10-K. Global Economic Conditions.  Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as greater political unrest in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, further economic instability in the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American markets and economic slowdowns in Japan and China, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings. Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings. Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. As discussed later in this MDA, we initiated certain non-manufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvements projects in 2012. If we are not successful in executing these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings. Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In 2015 and 2014, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Russia, Ukraine, Japan and Switzerland, have had, and could have, an additional significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Increased pricing in response to these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts, but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales. Government Policies. Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies. For example, the U.S. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly impact the corporate tax rate and change the U.S. tax treatment of international earnings. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt and currency exposure in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Argentina, China, Egypt, Greece, India, Nigeria, Ukraine and Venezuela. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings. During fiscal 2015, the Company deconsolidated its Venezuelan subsidiaries due to evolving conditions that have resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar and have restricted our ability to pay dividends and satisfy certain other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, SGA, other non-operating items and income taxes. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, the level of initiatives and other activities by competitors, geographic expansion and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume as well as pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the U.S. Most of our cost of products sold and SGA are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty, Hair and Personal Care segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary drivers of SGA are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we do achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other 27 The Procter  Gamble Company marketing efficiencies. Overhead costs are also variable in nature, but on a relative basis, less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth. Accordingly, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs. The Company is in the midst of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, marketing and overhead expenses. The plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. Net Sales Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 Net sales decreased 5% to $76.3 billion in 2015 on a 1% decrease in unit volume versus the prior year period. Volume grew low single digits in Fabric Care and Home Care. Volume decreased low single digits in Baby, Feminine and Family Care, Grooming and Health Care and decreased mid-single digits in Beauty, Hair and Personal Care. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and declined low single digits in developing regions due, in part, to pricing actions to address foreign exchange devaluations. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 6%, while higher pricing drove a 2% favorable impact on net sales. Organic volume decreased 1% and organic sales grew 1% driven by higher pricing. Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Net sales increased less than half a percent to $80.5 billion in 2014 on a 3% increase in unit volume versus the prior year period. Fabric Care and Home Care along with Baby, Feminine and Family Care volume grew mid-single digits. Grooming and Health Care volume grew low single digits. Beauty, Hair and Personal Care volume was unchanged. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and grew mid-single digits in developing regions. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3%. Organic sales grew 3% driven by the unit volume increase. A 1% favorable impact from higher pricing was offset by a 1% impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix due to higher relative growth of developing regions, which have lower than average selling prices, and of lower priced product categories such as Fabric Care and Baby Care. Operating Costs ##TABLE_START Comparisons as a percentage of net sales; Years ended June 30  Basis Point Change   Basis Point Change  Gross margin 49.0 %  (10 )  49.1 %  (100 )  50.1 % Selling, general and administrative expense 30.9 %   30.8 %  (170 )  32.5 % Operating margin 15.5 %  (280 )  18.3 %   17.2 % Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 15.5 %  (230 )  17.8 %   17.7 % Net earnings from continuing operations 11.7 %  (240 )  14.1 %   13.7 % Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble 9.2 %  (530 )  14.5 %   14.1 % ##TABLE_ENDFiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 Gross margin decreased 10 basis points to 49.0% of net sales in 2015. Gross margin benefited from a 200 basis point impact from manufacturing cost savings and a 90 basis point benefit from higher pricing. These impacts were offset by a 140 basis point impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix, primarily from a decline in the Prestige business, which has higher than average margins, and within the Fabric Care and Home Care and Grooming segments. Additional offsets include a 40 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, a 40 basis point impact from costs related to initiatives and capacity investments, a 30 basis point impact from higher restructuring costs and smaller impacts from lower volume scale and higher commodity costs. Total SGA decreased 5% to $23.6 billion, as reduced overhead and marketing spending was partially offset by increased foreign exchange transaction charges. SGA as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 30.9%, as the negative scale impacts of lower net sales and inflationary impacts were partially offset by cost savings efforts. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points behind lower spending due to efficiency efforts. Overhead spending as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points as productivity savings of 60 basis points from reduced overhead spending were more than offset by wage inflation, investments in research and development, the negative scale impacts of lower net sales and higher restructuring costs. Increased foreign exchange transaction charges added approximately 30 basis points to SGA as a percentage of net sales, as current year foreign currency transaction charges (from revaluing receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than a local entitys functional currency) were partially offset by lower year-on-year charges for Venezuela remeasurement and devaluation. During fiscal 2015, the Company incurred a $2.0 billion ($2.1 billion after tax) charge related to the deconsolidation of its Venezuelan subsidiaries. See the Venezuela Impacts later in the Results of Operations section. The Procter  Gamble Company 28 Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Gross margin contracted 100 basis points to 49.1% of net sales in 2014. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by a 150 basis point impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix, a 50 basis point impact from higher commodity costs and a 90 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings of 190 basis points and a 40 basis point benefit from higher pricing. The unfavorable geographic and product mix was caused by disproportionate growth in developing regions and the Fabric Care and Home Care and Baby, Feminine and Family Care segments, which have lower gross margins than the Company average. Total SGA decreased 5% to $ 24.8 billion in 2014 due to a reduction in marketing spending, overhead expense, impairment charges and restructuring costs. SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased 170 basis points to 30.8% . Lower restructuring spending drove 30 basis points of the decline. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 80 basis points primarily due to lower spending behind a focus on more efficient marketing support and scale benefits from increased net sales. Overhead spending decreased 50 basis points from productivity savings. Impairment charges were 40 basis points in 2013, but were zero in 2014. Charges for the 2014 foreign currency policy changes in Venezuela were comparable to the 2013 Venezuela devaluation impact. During fiscal 2013, we incurred impairment charges of $308 million ($290 million after tax) related to the carrying value of goodwill in our Appliances business and the related Braun trade name intangible asset. Non-Operating Items Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 Interest expense was $626 million in 2015, a decrease of $84 million versus the prior year due to lower average debt balances and a decrease in weighted average interest rates. Interest income was $151 million in 2015, an increase of $50 million versus the prior year due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. Other non-operating income, net, primarily includes divestiture gains and investment income. Other non-operating income increased $325 million to $531 million, primarily due to minor brand divestiture gains. In 2015, we had approximately $400 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Zest, Camay, Fekkai and Wash  Go hair care brands, Rochas and Laura Biagotti fine fragrance brands and Vaposteam. The prior year acquisition and divestiture activities included approximately $150 million in divestiture gains, primarily related to the sale of our bleach businesses in Europe, IMEA and Latin America, our Pert hair care business in Latin America and MDVIP. Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Interest expense increased 6% in 2014 to $ 710 million , primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding. Interest income was $ 101 million in 2014, an increase of $13 million versus the prior year due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. Other non-operating income, net, primarily includes divestiture gains and investment income. Other non-operating income decreased $735 million to $206 million, primarily due to acquisition and divestiture impacts. In 2014, we had approximately $150 million in divestiture gains, primarily related to the sale of our bleach businesses in Europe, IMEA and Latin America, our Pert hair care business in Latin America and MDVIP. The 2013 acquisition and divestiture activities included a $631 million holding gain resulting from PG's purchase of the balance of its Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia and an approximate $250 million gain from the divestiture of our Italy bleach business. Income Taxes Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 350 basis points to 24.6% in 2015 mainly due to the non-deductibility of the $2.0 billion Venezuelan deconsolidation charge. The rate increase caused by lower current year favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions (the net benefit was 80 basis points in the current year versus 160 basis points in the prior year) was largely offset by a decrease related to favorable geographic earnings mix. Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 170 basis points to 21.1% in 2014. The primary driver of this rate decline was approximately 320 basis points from the favorable geographic mix of earnings and approximately 60 basis points due to the non-deductibility of the 2013 impairment charges related to our Appliances business. These impacts were partially offset by a 50 basis point increase due to the Venezuela currency policy changes and devaluation discussed below (which decreased the prior year rate 20 basis points and increased the current year rate by 30 basis points), a 110 basis point increase due to the tax impacts of acquisition and divestiture activities (the gains from the purchase of the balance of the Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia and the sale of our Italy bleach business in 2013) and a 30 basis point increase due to the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions. The net benefit 2014 was $228 million, or 160 basis points, versus 190 basis points of net benefit in 2013. Net Earnings Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 Net earnings from continuing operations decreased $2.4 billion or 21% to $8.9 billion due to the $2.1 billion after tax charge related to the deconsolidation of Venezuelan subsidiaries and the decline in net sales, partially offset by reduced selling, general and administrative costs (SGA). Foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately $1.4 billion in 2015 due to the weakening of certain key currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily in Russia, Ukraine, Venezuela and Argentina, partially offset by lower after-tax charges related to balance sheet remeasurement charges in Venezuela. 29 The Procter  Gamble Company Net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $2.3 billion in 2015 due primarily to $2.1 billion of after tax impairment charges in our Batteries business (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and the absence of fiscal 2015 earnings from our divested Pet Care business. Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble decreased $4.6 billion, or 40% to $7.0 billion. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $0.80, or 21%, to $3.06 due to the decrease in net earnings. We had a diluted net loss per share from discontinued operations of $0.62 due primarily to the impairment charges on the Batteries business. This was a reduction of $0.78 per share versus the prior year. Diluted net earnings per share decreased $1.57, or 39%, to $2.44. Core EPS decreased 2% to $4.02. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges for Venezuelan deconsolidation, balance sheet remeasurement charges from foreign exchange policy changes and devaluation in Venezuela (see below), charges for certain European legal matters and incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan. The decline was driven by reduced net sales, partially offset by minor brand divestiture gains. Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Net earnings from continuing operations increased $365 million or 3% to $11.3 billion in 2014 due to the increase in sales and a 40-basis point expansion in net earnings margin. The increase in net earnings margin was primarily driven by the decrease in SGA as a percentage of net sales and the lower tax rate, partially offset by the gross margin contraction and the acquisition and divestiture-driven net reduction in other non-operating income, net. Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $18 million in 2014 due to stronger results in our Batteries business offsetting the ongoing impacts of prior year product recalls in Pet Care. Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble increased $331 million, or 3% to $11.6 billion. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 4% to $3.86 primarily due to the increase in net earnings. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations was $0.15 due to the earnings of the Batteries and Pet Care businesses. Diluted net earnings per share increased 4% to $4.01. Core EPS increased 5% to $4.09 primarily due to increased net sales, a 40 basis point net earnings margin expansion and the reduction in shares outstanding. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges from foreign exchange policy changes and the devaluation of the foreign exchange rates in Venezuela (see below), the 2013 holding gain on the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture, the 2013 impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and charges in both years for European legal matters and incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan. Venezuela Impacts Effective June 30, 2015, the Company deconsolidated its local Venezuelan operations from our Consolidated Financial Statements.  PG has operated in Venezuela for over 65 years and remains committed to serving Venezuelan consumers with our leading brands and products to grow our business. We expect our operations in Venezuela will continue for the foreseeable future. We continue to work proactively with the Venezuelan official agencies to ensure we fully understand and remain compliant as the policies within which our Venezuelan subsidiaries operate evolve. We do not expect this change in accounting to directly affect the local operations of our Venezuelan subsidiaries . There are a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions in Venezuela, which have evolved over time and may continue to evolve in the future. These evolving conditions have resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar and have restricted our Venezuelan operations ability to pay dividends and satisfy certain other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars. For accounting purposes, this has resulted in a lack of control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Therefore, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation, effective June 30, 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. This change resulted in a fourth quarter fiscal 2015 one-time before-tax charge of $2.0 billion ($2.1 billion after tax, or $0.71 per share). In future periods, our financial results will only include sales of finished goods to our Venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent we receive payments from Venezuela (expected to be largely through the CENCOEX exchange market). Accordingly, we will no longer include the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries operations in future reporting periods (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Our operations in Venezuela accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales and earnings from continuing operations (before the deconsolidation charge) during fiscal 2015. Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. As a result, prior to deconsolidation, the U.S. dollar had been the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Venezuela. A number of changes have been initiated in the Venezuelan exchange rate system, including changes that resulted in devaluations to their currency. Prior to deconsolidation, currency remeasurement adjustments for non-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by our Venezuelan subsidiaries, along with any other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses, have been reflected in earnings, and totaled $104 million, $275 million and $236 million on an after-tax basis in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. There are currently three official exchange rate mechanisms in Venezuela. The CENCOEX (National Center for External Commerce) exchange rate is 6.3 Venezuelan bolivares fuerte (VEF) per dollar and can be used for the importation of certain qualifying products and materials. SICAD (Complementary The Procter  Gamble Company 30 System for Foreign Exchange Administration) is an auction-based exchange program applicable to foreign investment transactions and certain other qualifying imports of finished goods and materials. The rate available through SICAD was 10.6 VEF per dollar at June 30, 2014 and 12.8 VEF per dollar at June 30, 2015. A third exchange mechanism, referred to as SIMADI (Sistema Marginal de Divisas), is also an auction-based program recently trading at approximately 200 VEF per dollar. Through December 31, 2013, Venezuela had only one officially established exchange rate for qualifying dividends and imported goods and services, the CENCOEX rate, previously CADIVI (Foreign Exchange Administrative Commission). Accordingly, through December 31, 2013, our results in Venezuela and all of our net monetary assets were measured at this exchange rate. On January 24, 2014, a number of announcements were made affecting currency exchange rate and other controls, including the introduction of the SICAD and SICAD II exchange rate mechanisms. In addition, based on local regulatory guidance, we had expected dividends to be executed under the SICAD rate. Accordingly, beginning in January 2014, other than transactions flowing through CENCOEX, our historical operations and balance sheet positions were generally measured using the SICAD rate. In January 2015, additional announcements were made relating to currency exchange rate and other controls, including the elimination of the SICAD II exchange rate and the introduction of the SIMADI rate. A significant portion of our imports have historically qualified for the CENCOEX rate. While we continue to import certain materials and products under this rate, payments for such qualifying imports have declined in recent years. At this time, there is considerable uncertainty as to how CENCOEX will operate in the future, including the nature and quantity of transactions that will continue to flow through CENCOEX. However, we believe a portion of our imports will continue to qualify for the preferential rate. We have had no recent access to the SICAD market for imports or dividends. To date, we have had limited access to the SIMADI market. Our plans and ability to access that market in the future is unclear. SEGMENT RESULTS Segment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs such as interest expense, investing activities and certain restructuring and asset impairment costs. These costs are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, as described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments. Eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate. All references to net earnings throughout the discussion of segment results refer to net earnings from continuing operations. ##TABLE_START Net Sales Change Drivers (2015 vs. 2014)  Volume with Acquisitions  Divestitures  Volume Excluding Acquisitions  Divestitures  Foreign Exchange  Price  Mix  Other  Net Sales Growth Beauty, Hair and Personal Care (4 )%  (3 )%  (5 )%  %  %  %  (7 )% Grooming (3 )%  (3 )%  (8 )%  %  %  %  (7 )% Health Care (1 )%  (1 )%  (5 )%  %  %  %  (1 )% Fabric Care and Home Care %  %  (6 )%  %  %  (1 )%  (5 )% Baby, Feminine and Family Care (1 )%  (1 )%  (6 )%  %  %  %  (3 )% TOTAL COMPANY (1 )%  (1 )%  (6 )%  %  %  %  (5 )% ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net Sales Change Drivers (2014 vs. 2013)  Volume with Acquisitions  Divestitures  Volume Excluding Acquisitions  Divestitures  Foreign Exchange  Price  Mix  Other  Net Sales Growth Beauty, Hair and Personal Care %  %  (2 )%  %  %  %  (2 )% Grooming %  %  (3 )%  %  (2 )%  %  % Health Care %  %  (1 )%  %  (1 )%  %  % Fabric Care and Home Care %  %  (3 )%  (1 )%  %  %  % Baby, Feminine and Family Care %  %  (3 )%  %  %  %  % TOTAL COMPANY %  %  (3 )%  %  (1 )%  %  % ##TABLE_ENDNet sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.

Global market share of the electronic hair removal category was flat. Net earnings decreased 9% to $1.8 billion due to the decline in net sales and a 40 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due to higher SGA spending as a percent of sales. Decreased spending due to marketing efficiencies and overhead reductions did not keep pace with the currency-driven reduction in net sales. Gross margin was unchanged as negative geographic mix from a disproportionate decline in developed regions was offset by manufacturing cost savings. Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Grooming net sales were flat at $8.0 billion in 2014 on a 1% increase in unit volume. Organic sales were up 3%. Price increases in Blades and Razors and Appliances contributed 4% to net sales growth.

Net earnings margin decreased primarily due to gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased due to the impact of foreign exchange, higher commodity cost and unfavorable product and geographic mix from disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier products, both of which have lower gross margins than the segment average, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and pricing. CORPORATE ##TABLE_START ($ millions)  Change vs. 2014   Change vs. 2013 Net sales $466  (37)%  $737  31% Net earnings $(2,181)  N/A  $(169)  N/A ##TABLE_ENDCorporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; certain asset impairment charges; certain balance sheet impacts from significant foreign exchange devaluations; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item is income taxes to adjust from blended statutory tax rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Net sales in Corporate decreased by $271 million in the current year primarily due to the prior year divestiture of the MDVIP business. Corporate net expenses from continuing operations increased $2.0 billion in 2015, primarily due the charge related to the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiaries, increased foreign exchange transactional charges and incremental restructuring charges, which were partially offset by gains on minor brand divestitures. Net sales in Corporate increased by $173 million in 2014. Corporate net earnings from continuing operations improved by $164 million in 2014, primarily due to reduced net after-tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges (which totaled $290 million in 2013 but were zero in 2014), lower 2014 restructuring and overhead spending and lower overall Company effective tax rate, partially offset by the holding gain in 2013 from the buyout of our Iberian joint venture partner. Additional discussion of the items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section. Productivity and Cost Savings Plan In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. As part of this plan, the Company expects to incur in excess of $5.0 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a six-year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017). Approximately 78% of the costs have been incurred through the end of fiscal 2015. Savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the corollary benefits achieved (e.g., enrollment reduction achieved via normal attrition), the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. Overall, these costs and other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions are expected to deliver approximately $3.0 billion in annual before-tax gross savings. The cumulative before-tax savings realized through 2015 were approximately $2.1 billion . Restructuring accruals of $389 million as of June 30, 2015 are classified as current liabilities. Approximately 70% of the restructuring charges incurred during fiscal 2015 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins. 35 The Procter  Gamble Company Refer to Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program and to the Operating Costs section of this MDA for more information about the total benefit to operating margins from our total savings efforts. CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations. Operating Cash Flow Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 Operating cash flow was $14.6 billion in 2015, a 5% increase from the prior year. Operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, impairment charges, gains on sale of businesses and the Venezuela deconsolidation charge) and a decrease in working capital, partially offset by the impact of other operating assets and liabilities. Reduced accounts receivable generated $349 million of cash due to changes in customer terms and improved collection results. The number of days sales outstanding decreased 5 days due to foreign exchange impacts and improvements in collection results and customer terms. Lower inventory generated $313 million of cash mainly due to supply chain optimizations and lower commodity costs. Inventory days on hand decreased 7 days due to foreign exchange impacts, supply chain optimizations and lower commodity costs. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $928 million in operating cash flow primarily driven by extended payment terms. Other operating assets and liabilities utilized $976 million of cash primarily to eliminate the deferred tax impacts associated with the Pet Care divestiture. Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Operating cash flow was $14.0 billion in 2014, a 6% decrease from the prior year, which was primarily driven by a $1.0 billion discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan. Operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and gains on sale of businesses) partially offset by the impact of other operating assets and liabilities. Working capital changes did not have a significant impact on operating cash flow in 2014. Reduced accounts receivable generated $87 million of cash primarily due to improved collection results, which, along with the timing and mix of sales late in the period, drove a 1 day decrease in accounts receivable days sales outstanding. Inventory changes did not significantly impact operating cash flow as inventory management improvement efforts offset inventory needed to support product initiatives and build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes. Inventory days on hand decreased by 3 days primarily due to inventory management improvement efforts. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities also did not significantly impact operating cash flow. Other operating assets and liabilities utilized $1.6 billion of cash, primarily driven by $1.0 billion of cash used for a discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan. Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding certain divestiture impacts (tax payments in the current year for the Pet Care divestiture) and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 Adjusted free cash flow was $11.6 billion in 2015, an increase of 15% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding impairment charges on the Batteries business and the Venezuelan deconsolidation charge, was 102% in 2015. Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Adjusted free cash flow was $10.1 billion in 2014, a decrease of 7% versus the prior year. The decrease was driven by the decrease in operating cash flows, which was primarily due to a $1.0 billion discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding impairment charges from divested businesses, was 86% in 2014. Investing Cash Flow Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 Net investing activities consumed $2.9 billion in cash in 2015 mainly due to capital spending, net purchases of available-for-sale securities and a reduction in cash due to Venezuela deconsolidation, partially offset by asset sales. Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Net investing activities consumed $4.1 billion in cash in 2014 mainly due to capital spending and cash paid for investments in available-for-sale securities, partially offset by asset sales. Capital Spending. We manage capital spending to support our business growth plans and have cost controls to deliver our cash generation targets. Capital expenditures, primarily to The Procter  Gamble Company 36 support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.7 billion in 2015 and $3.8 billion in 2014. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 4.9% in 2015. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales in 2014 decreased 10 basis points versus 2013 to 4.8%. Acquisitions. Acquisition activity was not material in 2015 or 2014. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales in 2015 contributed $4.5 billion in cash, primarily from the sale of our Pet Care business, the sale of our Chinese battery venture, and other minor brand divestitures. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $570 million in cash in 2014 mainly due to minor brand divestiture activities, including MDVIP, the Pert business in Latin America and the bleach business in Europe, IMEA and Latin America. Financing Cash Flow Dividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 6% to $2.59 per share in 2015. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $7.3 billion in 2015 and $6.9 billion in 2014. In April 2015, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.6436 to $0.6629 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This represents a 3% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 59th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend for 125 years, every year since our incorporation in 1890. Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $30.4 billion as of June 30, 2015 and $35.4 billion as of June 30, 2014. Our total debt decreased in 2015 mainly due to debt maturities, partially offset by debt issuances. Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $4.6 billion in 2015 and $6.0 billion in 2014. Liquidity At June 30, 2015, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $144 million ($2.5 billion, excluding current assets and current liabilities of the Batteries business held for sale), largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2015, $11.0 billion of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is held off-shore by foreign subsidiaries. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. We do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. On June 30, 2015, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard  Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings are Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard  Poor's), all with a stable outlook. We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $11.0 billion facility split between a $7.0 billion five-year facility and a $4.0 billion 364-day facility, which expire in August 2018 and July 2016, respectively. The 364-day facility can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain largely undrawn for the foreseeable future. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. For additional details on debt see Note 4. Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity. 37 The Procter  Gamble Company Contractual Commitments The following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2015 . ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions Total  Less Than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  After 5 Years RECORDED LIABILITIES          Total debt $ 30,185  $ 11,985  $ 3,403  $ 4,276  $ 10,521 Capital leases     Uncertain tax positions (1)        OTHER          Interest payments relating to long-term debt 6,925   1,277  1,017  3,932 Operating leases (2) 1,617     Minimum pension funding (3)       Purchase obligations (4) 1,507     TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS $ 41,387  $ 14,199  $ 6,028  $ 5,913  $ 15,247 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  As of June 30, 2015 , the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $1.5 billion, including $366 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2015 , cannot be made. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2018 are not currently determinable. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing. This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position. ##TABLE_END SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions. Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized. We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the The Procter  Gamble Company 38 progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. For additional details on the Company's income taxes, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Employee Benefits We sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits. The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense, since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2015, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets was 7.2% and 8.3%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $101 million. Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans of 3.1% and 4.5%, respectively, represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100-basis point change in the pension discount rate would impact annual after-tax defined benefit pension expense by approximately $195 million. A change in the OPEB discount rate of 100 basis points would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $60 million. For additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are primarily based on these same factors. All of our acquired technology and customer-related intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives. The costs of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. We 39 The Procter  Gamble Company test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the book values of each asset to the estimated fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. With the exception of our Appliances and Batteries businesses, all of our reporting units have fair values that significantly exceed recorded values. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. In addition, any potential change in the strategic plans for these businesses due to the refocusing of our business portfolio could impact these judgments, assumptions and estimates, in turn, impacting our fair value. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year. The recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets from recently impaired businesses and recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and therefore are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge. Prior to 2013, our Appliances reporting unit incurred an impairment charge to reduce the goodwill carrying amount to its estimated fair value. During 2013, the estimated fair value of our Appliances reporting unit declined further, below the carrying amount resulting from the prior impairment. Therefore, we recorded an additional non-cash before and after-tax impairment charge of $259 million in fiscal 2013. Additionally, our 2013 impairment testing for Appliances indicated a decline in the fair value of our Braun trade name intangible asset below its carrying value. This resulted in a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge of $49 million ( $31 million after-tax) to reduce the carrying amount of this asset to its estimated fair value. The impairment of the Appliances business in fiscal 2013 was due to the devaluation of currency in Japan, a key country that generates a significant portion of the earnings of the Appliances business, relative to the currencies in which the underlying net assets are recorded. As of June 30, 2015, the Appliances business has remaining goodwill of $299 million and remaining intangible assets of $706 million . As a result of the impairments, the estimated fair value of our Appliances business slightly exceeds its respective carrying value. Our 2015 valuation of the Appliances business has it returning to sales and earnings growth rates consistent with our long-term business plans. However, the currency in Japan has continued to devalue relative to the currencies in which the related assets are recorded, reducing the fair value cushion in the Appliances business to approximately 5% . During 2015, we determined that the estimated fair value of our Batteries reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, resulting in a series of impairment charges. The underlying fair value assessment was initially triggered by an agreement in September 2014 to sell the China-based battery joint venture and a related decision to pursue options to exit the remainder of the Batteries business. The results of our annual goodwill impairment testing during fiscal 2014 had indicated a decline in the fair value of the Batteries reporting unit due to lower long-term market growth assumptions in certain key geographies. At that time, the estimated fair value of the Batteries business continued to exceed its underlying carrying value, but the fair value cushion had been reduced to about 5% . The agreement to sell the China-based battery joint venture was at a transaction value that was below the earnings multiple implied from the prior valuation of our Batteries business, which effectively eliminated our fair value cushion. As a result, the remaining business unit cash flows no longer supported the remaining carrying amount of the Batteries business. Due largely to these factors, we recorded an initial non-cash, before and after-tax impairment charge of $863 million to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill for the Batteries business unit to its estimated fair value. These same factors resulted in a decline in the fair value of our Duracell trade name intangible asset below its carrying value. This resulted in a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge of $110 million ( $69 million after tax) to reduce the carrying amount of this asset to its estimated fair value. In November 2014, the Company reached an agreement to divest the remaining Batteries business via a split transaction in which the Company will exchange a recapitalized Duracell Company for Berkshire Hathaway's (BH) shares of PG stock (see Note 13). Based on the terms of the agreement and the value of BH's shares of PG stock at the agreement date, and changes thereto through June 30, 2015, the Company recorded additional non-cash, before and after-tax impairment charges totaling $1.2 billion. All of the fiscal 2015 impairment charges in the Batteries business are included as part of discontinued operations. The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. Changes to or a failure to achieve these business plans or a further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions could result in a valuation that would trigger an additional impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses. In addition, we also The Procter  Gamble Company 40 considered the structure and value of the divestiture agreement with BH in the impairment testing for Batteries. If the value of BHs shares of the Company declines further before the transaction closing dates, we may need to record additional non-cash impairment charges as part of discontinued operations in the future. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing results. New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of June 30, 2015 . OTHER INFORMATION Hedging and Derivative Financial Instruments As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. Except within financing operations, we leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the CorporateManager value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics dataset as of June 30, 2015 . In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics, a reasonable proxy is included. Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term. Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments. Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2015 , including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements. Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months. In addition, we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions. Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2015 , we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements. Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures. As of and during the years ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014 , we did not have any commodity hedging activity. Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAP Our discussion of financial results includes several \"non-GAAP\" financial measures. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in the MDA, we have provided the comparable U.S. GAAP measure in the discussion. These measures include: Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. 41 The Procter  Gamble Company The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth: ##TABLE_START Year ended June 30, 2015 Net Sales Growth Foreign Exchange Impact Acquisition/Divestiture Impact* Organic Sales Growth Beauty, Hair and Personal Care (7 )% % % (1 )% Grooming (7 )% % % % Health Care (1 )% % % % Fabric Care and Home Care (5 )% % % % Baby, Feminine and Family Care (3 )% % % % TOTAL COMPANY (5 )% % % %      Year ended June 30, 2014 Net Sales Growth Foreign Exchange Impact Acquisition/Divestiture Impact* Organic Sales Growth Beauty, Hair and Personal Care (2 )% % % % Grooming % % % % Health Care % % % % Fabric Care and Home Care % % % % Baby, Feminine and Family Care % % (1 )% % TOTAL COMPANY % % % % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Acquisition/Divestiture Impact includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. ##TABLE_END Core EPS. This is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. This includes: ##TABLE_START  charges in each period presented for 1) incremental restructuring due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings, 2) the impacts from foreign exchange policy changes and the devaluations of the official foreign currency exchange rate in Venezuela, and 3) for certain European legal matters; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a holding gain in 2013 on the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  impairment charges in 2013 for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a charge in 2015 for the Venezuelan deconsolidation . ##TABLE_END We do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results. We believe the Core EPS measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year earnings per share growth. Core EPS is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The table below provides a reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to Core EPS: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30 2014 Diluted net earnings per share - continuing operations $3.06 $3.86 $3.71 Incremental restructuring charges 0.20 0.12 0.17 Venezuela balance sheet devaluation impacts 0.04 0.09 0.08 Charges for European legal matters 0.01 0.02 0.05 Gain on purchase of balance of Iberian JV   (0.21) Impairment charges   0.10 Venezuelan deconsolidation 0.71   Rounding   (0.01) CORE EPS $4.02 $4.09 $3.89 Core EPS Growth (2 )% % % ##TABLE_ENDNote - All reconciling items are presented net of tax. Tax effects are calculated consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction. Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding certain divestiture impacts (tax payments in the current year for the Pet Care divestiture). We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Adjusted free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions): ##TABLE_START  Operating Cash Flow Capital Spending Free Cash Flow Cash Tax Payment - Pet Care Sale Adjusted Free Cash Flow $ 14,608 $ (3,736 ) $ 10,872 $ $ 11,601 13,958 (3,848 ) 10,110  10,110 14,873 (4,008 ) 10,865  10,865 ##TABLE_ENDAdjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity.

Moeller Chief Financial Officer 43 The Procter  Gamble Company MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of The Procter  Gamble Company (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Strong internal controls is an objective that is reinforced through our Worldwide Business Conduct Manual , which sets forth our commitment to conduct business with integrity, and within both the letter and the spirit of the law. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes a Control Self-Assessment Program that is conducted annually for critical financial reporting areas of the Company and is audited by the internal audit function. Management takes the appropriate action to correct any identified control deficiencies. Because of its inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, may not prevent or detect misstatements due to the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden or that misstatements due to error or fraud may occur that are not detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2015 , using criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2015 , based on these criteria. Deloitte  Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2015 , as stated in their report which is included herein. /s/ A. G. Lafley  A. G. Lafley Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer /s/ Jon R. Moeller  Jon R. Moeller Chief Financial Officer August 7, 2015  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Procter  Gamble Company We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Shareholders' Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2015 . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries at June 30, 2015 and 2014 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2015 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2015 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 7, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP  Cincinnati, Ohio August 7, 2015  The Procter  Gamble Company 44 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Procter  Gamble Company We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2015 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

The Procter  Gamble Company 50 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations The Procter  Gamble Company's (the \"Company,\" \"Procter  Gamble,\" \"we\" or \"us\") business is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through retail operations including mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation for amounts related to discontinued operations (see Note 13) and segment reporting (see Note 12). Prior to June 30, 2015 , we included the results of our Venezuelan operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements using the consolidation method of accounting. The Companys Venezuelan earnings and cash flows are reflected in the historical Consolidated Financial Statements using a combination of the official exchange rates, with imports of certain essential finished goods reflected at the CENCOEX rate of 6.30 bolivars per U.S. dollar and the remaining business, primarily related to our on-the-ground manufacturing and other business activities, reflected at the SICAD rate, which generally operated in a range of approximately 12 to 13 bolivars per U.S. dollar. Evolving conditions in Venezuela, including currency exchange regulations, other operating controls and restrictions, reduced access to dollars through official currency exchange markets and local market dynamics, have resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar, and have restricted our Venezuelan operations ability to pay dividends and satisfy certain other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars. While we continue to have access to dollars through the CENCOEX market for certain finished goods and raw materials imports, the currency and other controls in Venezuela have significantly limited our ability to realize the benefits from earnings of the Companys on-the-ground Venezuelan operations and to access the resulting liquidity provided by those operations. We expect that this condition will continue for the foreseeable future. For accounting purposes, this lack of exchangeability and evolving conditions has resulted in a lack of control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Therefore, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. This change, which we made effective June 30, 2015 , resulted in a fourth quarter fiscal 2015 one-time after-tax charge of $2.1 billion . This charge included the write-off of our investment in our Venezuelan subsidiaries, foreign currency translation losses of $255 previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and the write-off of certain intercompany receivables due from Venezuela subsidiaries, which was triggered by the decision to deconsolidate those subsidiaries. Our Venezuelan operations cash balance of $908 at June 30, 2015 (previously measured using a combination of CENCOEX and SICAD exchange rates), is no longer reported in Cash and cash equivalents. In future periods, our financial results will only include sales of finished goods to our Venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent we receive cash payments from those subsidiaries (expected to be largely through the CENCOEX exchange market). Accordingly, we will not include the results of our on-the-ground Venezuelan subsidiaries. Any dividends from our Venezuelan subsidiaries will be recorded as operating income upon receipt of the cash. Use of Estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, consumer and trade promotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, post-employment benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets, uncertain income tax positions and contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although management does not generally believe such differences would materially affect the financial statements in any individual year. However, in regard to ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those anticipated at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that materially affect the financial statements in a given year. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned. Revenue transactions represent sales of inventory. The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. The revenue includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to the customer. Our policy is to recognize revenue when title to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 51 The Procter  Gamble Company A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period the revenue is recognized. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred, generally at the time of the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in the Accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacture of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product. Cost of products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense (SGA) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items. Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $2.0 billion in 2015 and 2014 and $1.9 billion in 2013 . Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include worldwide television, print, radio, internet and in-store advertising expenses and were $8.3 billion in 2015 , $9.0 billion in 2014 and $9.4 billion in 2013 . Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids, which are included in SGA, as well as coupons and customer trade funds, which are recorded as reductions to net sales. Other Non-Operating Income, Net Other non-operating income, net, primarily includes net acquisition and divestiture gains and investment income. Currency Translation Financial statements of operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in Other comprehensive income (OCI). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Re-measurement adjustments for financial statements in highly inflationary economies and other transactional exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. Cash Flow Presentation The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method, which reconciles net earnings to cash flow from operating activities. Cash flows from foreign currency transactions and operations are translated at an average exchange rate for the period. Cash flows from hedging activities are included in the same category as the items being hedged. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as financing activities. Realized gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative instruments used to hedge currency exposures resulting from intercompany financing transactions are also classified as financing activities. Cash flows from other derivative instruments used to manage interest, commodity or other currency exposures are classified as operating activities. Cash payments related to income taxes are classified as operating activities. Cash flows from the Company's discontinued operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Investments Investment securities consist of readily marketable debt and equity securities. Unrealized gains or losses from investments classified as trading, if any, are charged to earnings. Unrealized gains or losses on securities classified as available-for-sale are generally recorded in OCI. If an available-for-sale security is other than temporarily impaired, the loss is charged to either earnings or OCI depending on our intent and ability to retain the security until we recover the full cost basis and the extent of the loss attributable to the creditworthiness of the issuer. Investment securities are included as Available-for-sale investment securities and Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Investments in certain companies over which we exert significant influence, but do not control the financial and operating decisions, are accounted for as equity method investments. Other investments that are not controlled, and over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method. Both equity and cost method investments are included as Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value. Product-related inventories are primarily maintained on the first-in, first-out method. Minor amounts of product inventories, including certain cosmetics and commodities, are maintained on the last-in, first-out method. The cost of spare part inventories is maintained using the average-cost method. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized over the assets' estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Machinery and equipment includes office furniture and fixtures ( 15 -year life), computer equipment and capitalized software ( 3 - to 5 -year lives) and manufacturing equipment ( 3 - to 20 -year lives). Buildings are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 40 years. Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, when appropriate, changes are made prospectively. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 52 impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. Our annual impairment testing of goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. We have acquired brands that have been determined to have indefinite lives. We evaluate a number of factors to determine whether an indefinite life is appropriate, including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and indefinite-lived assets may be adjusted to a determinable life. The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology and other intangible assets with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives. Customer relationships, brands and other non-contractual intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over periods generally ranging from 5 to 30 years. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and remaining lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted. For additional details on goodwill and intangible assets see Note 2. Fair Values of Financial Instruments Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Changes in assumptions or estimation methods could affect the fair value estimates; however, we do not believe any such changes would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, certain investments and short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair values of long-term debt and financial instruments are disclosed in Note 5. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This guidance outlines a single, comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. We will adopt the standard no later than July 1, 2018. While we are currently assessing the impact of the new standard, we do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The underlying fair value assessment was initially triggered by an agreement in September 2014 to sell the China-based battery joint venture and a related decision to pursue options to exit the remainder of the Batteries business. The agreement to sell the China-based battery joint venture was at a transaction value that was below the earnings multiple implied from the prior valuation of our Batteries business, which effectively eliminated our fair value cushion. As a result, the remaining business unit cash flows no longer supported the remaining carrying amount of the Batteries business. Due largely to these factors, we recorded an initial non-cash, before and after-tax impairment charge of $863 to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill for the Batteries business unit to its estimated fair value. These same factors resulted in a decline in the fair value of our Duracell trade name intangible asset below its carrying value. This resulted in a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge of $110 ( $69 after tax) to reduce the carrying amount of this asset to its estimated fair value. In November 2014, the Company reached an agreement to divest the Batteries business via a split transaction in which the Company will exchange a recapitalized Duracell Company for Berkshire Hathaway's (BH) shares of PG stock (see Note 13). Based on the terms of the agreement and the value of BH's shares of PG stock as of the transaction date and changes thereto through June 30, 2015, the Company recorded additional non-cash, before and after-tax impairment charges totaling $1.2 billion. All of the fiscal 2015 impairment charges in the Batteries business are included as part of discontinued operations. The Batteries goodwill is included in Corporate in the preceding table as of June 30, 2013 and 2014. The remaining Batteries goodwill at June 30, 2015 is reported in Assets held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining change in goodwill during fiscal 2015 was primarily due to currency translation across all reportable segments. On July 31, 2014, the Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care operations in North America, Latin America and other selected countries. In December 2014, the Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care operations in the other markets, primarily the European union countries. The Pet Care business was accounted for as a discontinued operation as of June 30, 2014. As a result, the Pet Care goodwill is included in Corporate in the preceding table as of June 30, 2013. Pet Care goodwill and intangible assets at June 30, 2014 were reported in Assets held for sale in accordance with the accounting principles for discontinued operations. The remaining change in goodwill during fiscal 2014 was primarily due to currency translation across all reportable segments. All of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges that are not reflected in discontinued operations are included in Corporate for segment reporting. The goodwill and intangible asset valuations are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those used in our valuations. To the extent such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows used to estimate fair value, we may need to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future. We also considered the structure and value of the divestiture agreement with BH in the impairment testing for Batteries. If the value of BHs shares of the Company declines further before the transaction closing date, we may need to record additional non-cash impairment charges as part of discontinued operations in the future.

Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually. In fiscal 2012, the Company initiated an incremental restructuring program as part of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The productivity and cost savings plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the Company's growth strategy. The Company expects to incur in excess of $5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a six year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017), including costs incurred as part of the ongoing and incremental restructuring program. Through the end of fiscal 2015, we have incurred $3.9 billion of the total expected restructuring charges under the program. The program includes a non-manufacturing overhead enrollment reduction target of approximately 25% - 30% through fiscal 2017. This has been updated from the previous non-manufacturing overhead enrollment reduction target of approximately 16% - 22% through fiscal 2016, which we expect to exceed. Through fiscal 2015, the Company has reduced non-manufacturing enrollment by approximately 12,600 , or approximately 21% ( 22% as of July 1, 2015). The reductions are enabled by the elimination of duplicate work, simplification through the use of technology and optimization of various functional and business organizations and the Company's global footprint. In addition, the plan includes integration of newly acquired companies and the optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs as outlined below. The Company incurred total restructuring charges of approximately $1,068 and $806 for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Approximately $427 and $358 of these charges were recorded in SGA for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively and approximately $628 and $399 of these charges were recorded in Cost of products sold, respectively. The remainder is included in discontinued operations. Since the inception of this restructuring program, the Company has incurred charges of approximately $3.9 billion . Approximately $2.0 billion of these charges were related to separations, $954 were asset-related and $944 were related to other restructuring-type costs. The following table presents restructuring activity for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014: ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions Separations Asset-Related Costs Other Total RESERVE JUNE 30, 2013 $ $  $ $ Charges 179 806 Cash spent (321 )  (248 ) (569 ) Charges against assets  (179 )  (179 ) RESERVE JUNE 30, 2014  381 Charges 289 1,068 Cash spent (507 )  (264 ) (771 ) Charges against assets  (289 )  (289 ) RESERVE JUNE 30, 2015 $ $  $ $ ##TABLE_ENDSeparation Costs Employee separation charges for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 related to severance packages for approximately 4,820 and 2,730 employees, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, these severance packages included Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 55 The Procter  Gamble Company approximately 2,340 and 1,640 non-manufacturing employees, respectively. These separations were primarily in North America and Western Europe. The packages were predominantly voluntary and the amounts were calculated based on salary levels and past service periods. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Since its inception, the restructuring program has incurred separation charges related to approximately 14,300 employees, of which approximately 8,620 are non-manufacturing overhead personnel. Asset-Related Costs Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal. These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardization. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other Costs Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program. Such charges primarily include employee relocation related to separations and office consolidations, termination of contracts related to supply chain redesign and the cost to change internal systems and processes to support the underlying organizational changes. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges are funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting. Accordingly, all charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment. However, for informative purposes, the following table summarizes the total restructuring costs related to our reportable segments: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30  Beauty, Hair and Personal Care $  $ Grooming  Health Care  Fabric Care and Home Care  Baby, Feminine and Family Care  Corporate (1)  Total Company $ 1,068  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Corporate includes costs related to allocated overheads, including charges related to our Sales and Market Operations, Global Business Services and Corporate Functions activities and costs related to discontinued operations from our Pet Care and Batteries businesses. ##TABLE_END NOTE 4 SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT  ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30  DEBT DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR Current portion of long-term debt $ 2,772  $ 4,307 Commercial paper 8,807  10,818 Other  TOTAL $ 12,021  $ 15,606 Short-term weighted average interest rates (1) 0.3 %  0.7 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Short-term weighted average interest rates include the effects of interest rate swaps discussed in Note 5. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30  LONG-TERM DEBT    3.15% USD note due September 2015  1.80% USD note due November 2015 1,000  1,000 4.85% USD note due December 2015  1.45% USD note due August 2016 1,000  1,000 0.75% USD note due November 2016  Floating rate USD note due November 2016  5.13% EUR note due October 2017 1,231  1,501 1.60% USD note due November 2018 1,000  1,000 4.70% USD note due February 2019 1,250  1,250 1.90% USD note due November 2019   0.28% JPY note due May 2020   4.13% EUR note due December 2020  9.36% ESOP debentures due 2015-2021  (1)  2.00% EUR note due November 2021  1,023 2.30% USD note due February 2022 1,000  1,000 2.00% EUR note due August 2022 1,119  1,365 3.10% USD note due August 2023 1,000  1,000 4.88% EUR note due May 2027 1,119  1,365 6.25% GBP note due January 2030  5.50% USD note due February 2034  5.80% USD note due August 2034  5.55% USD note due March 2037 1,400  1,400 Capital lease obligations  All other long-term debt 2,394  5,521 Current portion of long-term debt (2,772 )  (4,307 ) TOTAL $18,329  $19,811 Long-term weighted average interest rates (2) 3.2 %  3.2 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Debt issued by the ESOP is guaranteed by the Company and must be recorded as debt of the Company, as discussed in Note 9. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Long-term weighted average interest rates include the effects of interest rate swaps discussed in Note 5. ##TABLE_END Long-term debt maturities during the next five fiscal years are as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ending June 30 2017 2019 Debt maturities $2,772 $2,094 $1,330 $2,355 $1,929 ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company fully and unconditionally guarantees the registered debt and securities issued by its 100% owned finance subsidiaries.

The Procter  Gamble Company 56 NOTE 5 RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. To the extent we choose to manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions that we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. At inception, we formally designate and document qualifying instruments as hedges of underlying exposures. We formally assess, at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. Fluctuations in the value of these instruments generally are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. This is driven by the high degree of effectiveness between the exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument. The ineffective portion of a change in the fair value of a qualifying instrument is immediately recognized in earnings. The amount of ineffectiveness recognized was immaterial for all years presented. Credit Risk Management We have counterparty credit guidelines and normally enter into transactions with investment grade financial institutions, to the extent commercially viable. Counterparty exposures are monitored daily and downgrades in counterparty credit ratings are reviewed on a timely basis. We have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, material credit losses on our risk management or other financial instruments. Substantially all of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position as of June 30, 2015 , was not material. The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features. Interest Rate Risk Management Our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. To manage this risk in a cost-efficient manner, we enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to exchange with the counterparty, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional amount. Interest rate swaps that meet specific accounting criteria are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in interest expense. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument is reported in OCI and reclassified into interest expense over the life of the underlying debt obligation. The ineffective portion for both cash flow and fair value hedges, which was not material for any year presented, was immediately recognized in interest expense. Foreign Currency Risk Management We manufacture and sell our products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world. As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To manage the exchange rate risk primarily associated with the financing of our operations, we have historically used a combination of forward contracts, options and currency swaps. As of June 30, 2015 , we had currency swaps with original maturities up to five years , which are intended to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in OCI and reclassified into SGA and interest expense in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion, which was not material for any year presented, was immediately recognized in SGA. The change in fair values of certain non-qualifying instruments used to manage foreign exchange exposure of intercompany financing transactions and certain balance sheet items subject to revaluation are immediately recognized in earnings, substantially offsetting the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposures. Net Investment Hedging We hedge certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries. To accomplish this, we either borrow directly in foreign currencies and designate all or a portion of the foreign currency debt as a hedge of the applicable net investment position or we enter into foreign currency swaps that are designated as hedges of net investments. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in OCI to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. The ineffective portion of these hedges, which was not material in any year presented, was immediately recognized in interest expense. Commodity Risk Management Certain raw materials used in our products or production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. To manage the volatility related to anticipated purchases of certain of these materials, we have historically, on a limited basis, used futures and options with maturities generally less than one year and swap contracts with maturities up to five years . As of and during the years ended Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 57 The Procter  Gamble Company June 30, 2015 and 2014 , we did not have any commodity hedging activity. Insurance We self-insure for most insurable risks. However, we purchase insurance for Directors and Officers Liability and certain other coverage where it is required by law or by contract. Fair Value Hierarchy Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: ##TABLE_START  Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets. ##TABLE_ENDWhen applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets or liabilities during the year. Our fair value estimates take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and our counterparties. When active market quotes are not available for financial assets and liabilities, we use industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including credit risk, interest rate curves, foreign currency rates and forward and spot prices for currencies. In circumstances where market-based observable inputs are not available, management judgment is used to develop assumptions to estimate fair value. Generally, the fair value of our Level 3 instruments is estimated as the net present value of expected future cash flows based on external inputs. The following table sets forth the Company's financial assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy: ##TABLE_START  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total Years ended June 30        ASSETS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE Investments:                U.S. government securities $   $   $ 3,495  $ 1,631  $   $   $ 3,495  $ 1,631 Corporate bond securities     1,272       1,272  Other investments          Derivatives relating to:                Foreign currency hedges            Other foreign currency instruments (1)            Interest rates            Net investment hedges            TOTAL ASSETS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE (2) $  $  $ 5,360  $ 2,585  $  $  $ 5,390  $ 2,615 LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE Derivatives relating to:                Other foreign currency instruments (1) $   $   $  $  $   $   $  $ Interest rates            Net investment hedges            TOTAL LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE (3) $   $   $  $  $   $   $  $ FAIR VALUE OF LONG-TERM DEBT (4) $ 20,947  $ 24,747  $ 2,182  $ 1,682  $   $   $ 23,129  $ 26,429 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Other foreign currency instruments are comprised of foreign currency financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other noncurrent assets.

Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble and common shares used to calculate basic and diluted net earnings per share were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Continuing Operations Dis-continued Operations Total  Continuing Operations Dis-continued Operations Total  Continuing Operations Dis-continued Operations Total Net earnings/(loss) $ 8,930 $ (1,786 ) $ 7,144  $ 11,318 $ $ 11,785  $ 10,953 $ $ 11,402 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (100 ) (8 ) (108 )  (121 ) (21 ) (142 )  (93 ) (90 ) Net earnings/(loss) attributable to PG (Diluted) 8,830 (1,794 ) 7,036  11,197 11,643  10,860 11,312 Preferred dividends, net of tax (259 )  (259 )  (253 )  (253 )  (244 )  (244 ) Net earnings/(loss) attributable to PG available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 8,571 $ (1,794 ) $ 6,777  $ 10,944 $ $ 11,390  $ 10,616 $ $ 11,068 SHARES IN MILLIONS            Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,711.7 2,711.7 2,711.7  2,719.8 2,719.8 2,719.8  2,742.9 2,742.9 2,742.9 Effect of dilutive securities            Conversion of preferred shares (1) 108.6 108.6 108.6  112.3 112.3 112.3  116.8 116.8 116.8 Exercise of stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 63.3 63.3 63.3  72.6 72.6 72.6  70.9 70.9 70.9 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,883.6 2,883.6 2,883.6  2,904.7 2,904.7 2,904.7  2,930.6 2,930.6 2,930.6 PER SHARE AMOUNTS            Basic net earnings/(loss) per common share (3) $ 3.16 $ (0.66 ) $ 2.50  $ 4.03 $ 0.16 $ 4.19  $ 3.87 $ 0.17 $ 4.04 Diluted net earnings/(loss) per common share (3) $ 3.06 $ (0.62 ) $ 2.44  $ 3.86 $ 0.15 $ 4.01  $ 3.71 $ 0.15 $ 3.86 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Despite being included currently in Diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold.

Exercise prices on options granted have been, and continue to be, set equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of the grant. Since September 2002, the key manager stock option awards granted vest after three years and have a 10 -year life. The key manager stock option awards granted from July 1998 through August 2002 vested after three years and have a 15 -year life. Key managers can elect to receive up to the entire value of their option award in RSUs. Key manager RSUs vest and are settled in shares of common stock five years from the grant date. The awards provided to the Company's directors are in the form of restricted stock and RSUs. In addition to our key manager and director grants, we make other minor stock option and RSU Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 61 The Procter  Gamble Company grants to employees for which the terms are not substantially different than key manager awards. Senior-level executives receive PSU awards. Under this program, the number of PSUs that will vest three years after the respective grant date is based on the Company's performance relative to pre-established performance goals during that three year period. A total of 185 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under stock-based compensation plan approved by shareholders in 2014. The number of shares available for award under the 2014 plan includes the shares previously authorized but not awarded under the shareholder approved plans in 2003 and 2009. A total of 156 million shares remain available for grant under the 2014 plan. Total stock-based compensation expense for stock option grants was $223 , $246 and $249 for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Total compensation expense for restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs was $114 , $114 and $97 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for stock options, restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs was $109 , $127 and $96 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. In calculating the compensation expense for stock options granted, we utilize a binomial lattice-based valuation model. Assumptions utilized in the model, which are evaluated and revised to reflect market conditions and experience, were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   Interest rate 0.1 - 2.1 %  0.1 - 2.8 %  0.2 - 2.0 % Weighted average interest rate 2.0 %  2.5 %  1.8 % Dividend yield 3.1 %  3.1 %  2.9 % Expected volatility - %  - %  - % Weighted average volatility %  %  % Expected life in years 8.3   8.2   8.9  ##TABLE_ENDLattice-based option valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs and those ranges are disclosed in the preceding table. Expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatilities of call options on our stock. We use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination patterns within the valuation model. The expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. A summary of options, RSUs and PSUs outstanding under the plans as of June 30, 2015 and activity during the year then ended is presented below: ##TABLE_START Options Options (in thousands) Weighted Avg.

The total grant-date fair value of options that vested during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $241 , $319 and $352 , respectively. At June 30, 2015 , there was $205 of compensation cost that has not yet been recognized related to stock option grants. That cost is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 1.9 years. Cash received from options exercised was $2,631 , $1,938 and $3,294 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

The Procter  Gamble Company 62 NOTE 9 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN We offer various postretirement benefits to our employees. Defined Contribution Retirement Plans We have defined contribution plans which cover the majority of our U.S. employees, as well as employees in certain other countries. These plans are fully funded. We generally make contributions to participants' accounts based on individual base salaries and years of service. Total global defined contribution expense was $305 , $311 and $314 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The primary U.S. defined contribution plan (the U.S. DC plan) comprises the majority of the expense for the Company's defined contribution plans. For the U.S. DC plan, the contribution rate is set annually. Total contributions for this plan approximated 14% of total participants' annual wages and salaries in 2015 and 15% in 2014 and 2013 . We maintain The Procter  Gamble Profit Sharing Trust (Trust) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) to provide a portion of the funding for the U.S. DC plan and other retiree benefits (described below). Operating details of the ESOP are provided at the end of this Note. The fair value of the ESOP Series A shares allocated to participants reduces our cash contribution required to fund the U.S. DC plan. Defined Benefit Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits We offer defined benefit retirement pension plans to certain employees. These benefits relate primarily to local plans outside the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, plans assumed in previous acquisitions covering U.S. employees. We also provide certain other retiree benefits, primarily health care and life insurance, for the majority of our U.S. employees who become eligible for these benefits when they meet minimum age and service requirements. Generally, the health care plans require cost sharing with retirees and pay a stated percentage of expenses, reduced by deductibles and other coverages. These benefits are primarily funded by ESOP Series B shares and certain other assets contributed by the Company. Obligation and Funded Status .

In these instances, benefit payments are typically paid directly from the Company's cash as they become due. ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits Years ended June 30    CLASSIFICATION OF NET AMOUNT RECOGNIZED        Noncurrent assets $  $  $   $  Current liabilities (39 )  (40 )  (20 )  (25 ) Noncurrent liabilities (5,583 )  (5,984 )  (1,414 )  (1,906 ) NET AMOUNT RECOGNIZED $ (5,346 )  $ (5,955 )  $ (1,434 )  $ (1,931 ) AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI)        Net actuarial loss $ 4,488  $ 5,169  $ 1,731  $ 1,871 Prior service cost/(credit)   (346 )  (39 ) NET AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN AOCI $ 4,788  $ 5,513  $ 1,385  $ 1,832 ##TABLE_ENDThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $14,239 and $14,949 as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.

We determine our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis. These assumptions are weighted to reflect each country that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits. As of June 30, 2015, we updated our assumptions for revised mortality projections for the measurement of U.S. retirement benefit obligations that reflect longevity improvements of plan participants, resulting in an increase to future pension expense and to our benefit obligation. The weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, were as follows: (1)  ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits     Discount rate 3.1 %  3.5 %  4.5 %  4.4 % Rate of compensation increase 3.1 %  3.2 %  N/A  N/A Health care cost trend rates assumed for next year N/A  N/A  6.8 %  6.8 % Rate to which the health care cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend rate) N/A  N/A  5.0 %  5.0 % Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate N/A  N/A   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Determined as of end of year. ##TABLE_END The weighted average assumptions used to determine net benefit cost recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the years ended June 30, were as follows: (1)  ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits Years ended June 30      Discount rate 3.5 %  4.0 %  4.2 %  4.4 %  4.8 %  4.3 % Expected return on plan assets 7.2 %  7.2 %  7.3 %  8.3 %  8.3 %  8.3 % Rate of compensation increase 3.2 %  3.2 %  3.3 %  N/A  N/A  N/A ##TABLE_END(1) Determined as of beginning of year and adjusted for acquisitions. Several factors are considered in developing the estimate for the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets. For the defined benefit retirement plans, these factors include historical rates of return of broad equity and bond indices and projected long-term rates of return obtained from pension investment consultants. The expected long-term rates of return for plan assets are 8 - 9% for equities and 5 - 6% for bonds. For other retiree benefit plans, the expected long-term rate of return reflects that the assets are comprised primarily of Company stock. The expected rate of return on Company stock is based on the long-term projected return of 8.5% and reflects the historical pattern of returns. Assumed health care cost trend rates could have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other retiree benefit plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: ##TABLE_START  One-Percentage Point Increase  One-Percentage Point Decrease Effect on the total service and interest cost components $  $ (62 ) Effect on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation  (642 ) ##TABLE_ENDPlan Assets . Our investment objective for defined benefit retirement plan assets is to meet the plans' benefit obligations, while minimizing the potential for future required Company plan contributions. The investment strategies focus on asset class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit payments and an appropriate balance of long-term investment return and risk. Target ranges for asset allocations are determined by matching the actuarial projections of the plans' future liabilities and benefit payments with expected long-term rates of return on the assets, taking into account investment return volatility and correlations across asset classes. Plan assets are diversified across several investment managers and are generally invested in liquid funds that are selected to track broad market equity and bond indices. Investment risk is carefully controlled with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and with continual monitoring of investment managers' performance relative to the investment guidelines established with each investment manager. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 65 The Procter  Gamble Company Our target asset allocation for the year ended June 30, 2015 , and actual asset allocation by asset category as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 , were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Target Asset Allocation  Actual Asset Allocation at June 30  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits Asset Category      Cash %  %  %  %  %  % Debt securities %  %  %  %  %  % Equity securities %  %  %  %  %  % TOTAL %  %  %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDThe following tables set forth the fair value of the Company's plan assets as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy (refer to Note 5 for further discussion on the fair value hierarchy and fair value principles). Common collective funds are valued using the net asset value reported by the managers of the funds and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. Company stock listed as Level 2 in the hierarchy represents preferred shares which are valued based on the value of Company common stock. The majority of our Level 3 pension assets are insurance contracts. Their fair values are based on their cash equivalent or models that project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs, including credit risk and interest rate curves. ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total Years ended June 30        ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE                Cash and cash equivalents $  $  $  $   $   $   $  $ Collective fund - equity     5,054  5,336      5,054  5,336 Collective fund - fixed income     5,162  5,539      5,162  5,539 Other          TOTAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE $  $  $ 10,328  $ 10,875  $  $  $ 10,605  $ 11,098 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Retiree Benefits  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total Years ended June 30        ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE                Cash and cash equivalents $  $  $   $   $   $   $  $ Company stock     3,239  3,304      3,239  3,304 Common collective fund - equity            Common collective fund - fixed income            Other              TOTAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE $  $  $ 3,434  $ 3,539  $   $  $ 3,470  $ 3,574 ##TABLE_ENDThere was no significant activity within the Level 3 pension and other retiree benefits plan assets during the years presented. Cash Flows . Management's best estimate of cash requirements and discretionary contributions for the defined benefit retirement plans and other retiree benefit plans for the year ending June 30, 2016 , is $215 and $34 , respectively. For the defined benefit retirement plans, this is comprised of $96 in expected benefit payments from the Company directly to participants of unfunded plans and $119 of expected contributions to funded plans. For other retiree benefit plans, this is comprised of $27 in expected benefit payments from the Company directly to participants of unfunded plans and $7 of expected contributions to funded plans. Expected contributions are dependent on many variables, including the variability of the market value of the plan assets as compared to the benefit obligation and other market or regulatory conditions. In addition, we take into consideration our business investment opportunities and resulting cash requirements. Accordingly, actual funding may differ significantly from current estimates. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 66 Total benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which include payments funded from the Company's assets and payments from the plans are as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ending June 30 Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS   $  $ 2017  2018  2019  2020  2021 - 2025 3,403  1,334 ##TABLE_ENDEmployee Stock Ownership Plan We maintain the ESOP to provide funding for certain employee benefits discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The ESOP borrowed $1.0 billion in 1989 and the proceeds were used to purchase Series A ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the U.S. DC plan. Principal and interest requirements of the borrowing were paid by the Trust from dividends on the preferred shares and from advances provided by the Company. The original borrowing of $1.0 billion has been repaid in full, and advances from the Company of $86 remain outstanding at June 30, 2015 . Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock. The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $2.59 per share. The liquidation value is $6.82 per share. In 1991, the ESOP borrowed an additional $1.0 billion . The proceeds were used to purchase Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of retiree health care benefits. These shares, net of the ESOP's debt, are considered plan assets of the other retiree benefits plan discussed above. Debt service requirements are funded by preferred stock dividends, cash contributions and advances provided by the Company, of which $662 is outstanding at June 30, 2015 . Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock. The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $2.59 per share. The liquidation value is $12.96 per share. Our ESOP accounting practices are consistent with current ESOP accounting guidance, including the permissible continuation of certain provisions from prior accounting guidance. ESOP debt, which is guaranteed by the Company, is recorded as debt (see Note 4) with an offset to the reserve for ESOP debt retirement, which is presented within shareholders' equity. Advances to the ESOP by the Company are recorded as an increase in the reserve for ESOP debt retirement. Interest incurred on the ESOP debt is recorded as interest expense. Dividends on all preferred shares, net of related tax benefits, are charged to retained earnings. The series A and B preferred shares of the ESOP are allocated to employees based on debt service requirements. The number of preferred shares outstanding at June 30 was as follows: ##TABLE_START Shares in thousands   Allocated 42,044  44,465  45,535 Unallocated 7,228  8,474  9,843 TOTAL SERIES A 49,272  52,939  55,378     Allocated 23,074  22,085  21,278 Unallocated 34,096  35,753  37,300 TOTAL SERIES B 57,170  57,838  58,578 ##TABLE_ENDFor purposes of calculating diluted net earnings per common share, the preferred shares held by the ESOP are considered converted from inception. NOTE 10 INCOME TAXES Income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current year and for the impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which represent future tax consequences of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using the enacted statutory tax rates and are adjusted for any changes in such rates in the period of change. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   United States $ 8,863  $ 8,816  $ 8,020 International 2,983  5,521  6,159 TOTAL $ 11,846  $ 14,337  $ 14,179 ##TABLE_ENDIncome taxes on continuing operations consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   CURRENT TAX EXPENSE U.S. federal $ 2,272  $ 1,524  $ 1,745 International 1,195  1,301  1,502 U.S. state and local    3,719  3,062  3,525 DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE U.S. federal (611 )   International and other (192 )  (185 )  (484 )  (803 )  (43 )  (299 ) TOTAL TAX EXPENSE $ 2,916  $ 3,019  $ 3,226 ##TABLE_ENDAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 67 The Procter  Gamble Company A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to our actual income tax rate on continuing operations is provided below: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   U.S. federal statutory income tax rate 35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % Country mix impacts of foreign operations (13.9 )%  (11.1 )%  (7.8 )% Changes in uncertain tax positions (0.8 )%  (1.6 )%  (1.9 )% Impairment adjustments  %   %  0.6 % Holding gain on joint venture buy-out  %   %  (1.5 )% Venezuela deconsolidation charge 6.2 %   %   % Other (1.9 )%  (1.2 )%  (1.6 )% EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE 24.6 %  21.1 %  22.8 % ##TABLE_ENDChanges in uncertain tax positions represent changes in our net liability related to prior year tax positions. Country mix impacts of foreign operations includes the effects of foreign subsidiaries' earnings taxed at rates other than the U.S. statutory rate, the U.S. tax impacts of non-U.S. earnings repatriation and any net impacts of intercompany transactions. Tax costs charged to shareholders' equity totaled $634 for the year ended June 30, 2015 . This primarily relates to the tax effects of net investment hedges and the impact of certain adjustments to pension obligations recorded in stockholders' equity, partially offset by excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Tax benefits to shareholders' equity totaled $716 for the year ended June 30, 2014 . This primarily relates to the tax effects of net investment hedges, excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and the impacts of certain adjustments to pension and other retiree benefit obligations recorded in shareholders' equity. We have undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $45.0 billion at June 30, 2015 , for which deferred taxes have not been provided. Such earnings are considered indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiaries. If such earnings were repatriated, additional tax expense may result. However, the calculation of the amount of deferred U.S. income tax on these earnings is not practicable because of the large number of assumptions necessary to compute the tax. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for uncertain tax positions is as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   BEGINNING OF YEAR $ 1,437  $ 1,600  $ 1,773 Increases in tax positions for prior years   Decreases in tax positions for prior years (146 )  (296 )  (225 ) Increases in tax positions for current year   Settlements with taxing authorities (250 )  (135 )  (195 ) Lapse in statute of limitations (27 )  (33 )  (98 ) Currency translation (123 )   (5 ) END OF YEAR $ 1,096  $ 1,437  $ 1,600 ##TABLE_ENDIncluded in the total liability for uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2015 , is $510 that, depending on the ultimate resolution, could impact the effective tax rate in future periods. The Company is present in approximately 140 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 60 - 70 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statute of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2002 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $445 , including interest and penalties. Accounting pronouncements require that, without discretion, we recognize the additional accrual of any possible related interest and penalties relating to the underlying uncertain tax position in income tax expense, unless the Company qualifies for a specific exception. As of June 30, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , we had accrued interest of $347 , $411 and $413 and accrued penalties of $19 , $32 and $34 , respectively, which are not included in the above table. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , we recognized $15 , $(6) and $24 in interest benefit/(expense) and $13 , $2 and $32 in penalties benefit, respectively. The net benefits recognized resulted primarily from the favorable resolution of tax positions for prior years. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.

If unused, $1.2 billion will expire between 2015 and 2034. The remainder, totaling $1.9 billion at June 30, 2015 , may be carried forward indefinitely. NOTE 11 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Guarantees In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may provide routine indemnifications (e.g., indemnification for representations and warranties and retention of previously existing environmental, tax and employee liabilities) for which terms range in duration and, in some circumstances, are not explicitly defined. The maximum obligation under some indemnifications is also not explicitly stated and, as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss on any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In certain situations, we guarantee loans for suppliers and customers. The total amount of guarantees issued under such arrangements is not material. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that have a material impact on our financial statements. Purchase Commitments and Operating Leases We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations are as follows:  ##TABLE_START Years ending June 30 2017 2019 Thereafter Purchase obligations $ $ $ $ $ $ ##TABLE_ENDSuch amounts represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing. This includes purchase commitments related to service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced to third-party suppliers. Due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination. We do not expect to incur penalty payments under these provisions that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We also lease certain property and equipment for varying periods. Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases, net of guaranteed sublease income, are as follows:  ##TABLE_START Years ending June 30 2017 2019 Thereafter Operating leases $ $ $ $ $ $ ##TABLE_ENDLitigation We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters such as antitrust, trade and other governmental regulations, product liability, patent and trademark, advertising, contracts, environmental, labor and employment and income taxes. As previously disclosed, the Company has had a number of antitrust matters in Europe. These matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers. Several regulatory authorities in Europe have issued separate decisions pursuant to their investigations alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in those countries. Many of these matters have concluded and the fines have been paid. For ongoing matters, the Company has accrued liabilities for competition law violations from these European cases totaling $38 as of June 30, 2015 . While the ultimate resolution of Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 69 The Procter  Gamble Company ongoing matters for which we have accrued liabilities may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts reserved, it is difficult to estimate such amounts at this time. Currently, however, we do not expect any such incremental losses to materially impact our financial statements in the periods in which they are accrued and paid, respectively. With respect to other litigation and claims, while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. NOTE 12 SEGMENT INFORMATION Our Global Business Units (GBUs) are organized into four industry-based sectors, comprised of 1) Global Beauty, 2) Global Health and Grooming, 3) Global Fabric and Home Care and 4) Global Baby, Feminine and Family Care. The Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care business during the current fiscal year. On November 13, 2014, the Company announced that it plans to divest the Batteries business via a transaction with Berkshire Hathaway. The Company expects to complete the Batteries transaction in the beginning of calendar year 2016, pending necessary regulatory approvals. These GBUs are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented (see Note 13). Under U.S. GAAP, the remaining GBUs underlying the four sectors are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, Hair and Personal Care , 2) Grooming , 3) Health Care , 4) Fabric Care and Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine and Family Care . Our five reportable segments are comprised of: ##TABLE_START  Beauty, Hair and Personal Care : Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); Cosmetics; Hair Care and Color; Prestige (SKII, Fragrances); Salon Professional; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Grooming : Shave Care (Female Blades  Razors, Male Blades  Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care); Electronic Hair Removal; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Health Care : Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care); Oral Care (Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fabric Care and Home Care : Fabric Care (Laundry Additives, Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, Surface Care, PG Professional); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Baby, Feminine and Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult ##TABLE_ENDIncontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper). The accounting policies of the segments are generally the same as those described in Note 1. Differences between these policies and U.S. GAAP primarily reflect income taxes, which are reflected in the segments using applicable blended statutory rates. Adjustments to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate. Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities that are not reflected in the operating results used internally to measure and evaluate the businesses, as well as items to adjust management reporting principles to U.S. GAAP. Operating activities in Corporate include the results of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Operating elements also include certain employee benefit costs, the costs of certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization and other general Corporate items. The non-operating elements in Corporate primarily include interest expense, certain acquisition and divestiture gains and interest and investing income. Total assets for the reportable segments include those assets managed by the reportable segment, primarily inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets. Other assets, primarily cash, accounts receivable, investment securities and goodwill, are included in Corporate. Our business units are comprised of similar product categories. Nine business units individually accounted for 5% or more of consolidated net sales as follows: ##TABLE_START % of Sales by Business Unit* Years ended June 30   Fabric Care 20%  21%  21% Baby Care 14%  14%  13% Hair Care and Color 11%  11%  12% Shave Care 9%  9%  9% Home Care 8%  8%  8% Family Care 7%  7%  7% Oral Care 7%  7%  7% Feminine Care 6%  6%  6% Skin and Personal Care 6%  6%  6% All Other 12%  11%  11% TOTAL 100%  100%  100% ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * % of sales by business unit excludes sales held in Corporate. ##TABLE_END The Company had net sales in the U.S. of $28.3 billion , $28.3 billion and $28.1 billion for the years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Long-lived assets in the U.S. totaled $8.4 billion and $8.7 billion as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Long-lived assets consists of property, plant and equipment. No other country's net sales or long-lived assets exceed 10% of the Company totals. Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 14% of consolidated net sales in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .

In November 2014, the Company reached an agreement to divest the remainder of its Batteries business to Berkshire Hathaway (BH) via a split transaction, in which the Company will exchange a recapitalized Duracell Company for BH's shares of PG stock. As of the date the transaction was signed, BH's shares were valued at approximately $4.7 billion . As of June 30, 2015, this value has declined to approximately $4.1 billion . The Company expects to contribute approximately $1.8 billion in cash to the Duracell Company in the pre-transaction recapitalization, subject to final working capital adjustments. The Company recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived asset impairment charges during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 which reflected the total estimated proceeds from the divestiture transactions (see Note 2). Since the number of shares of PG stock the Company will receive in the Batteries transaction is fixed, the total value to be received in the transaction will be based on the Company's share price as of the closing date, which is expected to occur in the beginning of calendar 2016 . Accordingly, any further increase or decrease in the Company's share price before the closing date will ultimately be reflected in earnings from discontinued operations as a gain or loss. The Batteries business had historically been part of the Company's Fabric Care and Home Care reportable segment. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Batteries business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Additionally, the Batteries balance sheet positions as of June 30, 2015 are presented as Assets and Liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On July 31, 2014, the Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care operations in North America, Latin America, and other selected countries to Mars, Incorporated (Mars) for $2.9 Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 71 The Procter  Gamble Company billion in an all-cash transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, Mars acquired our branded pet care products, our manufacturing sites in the United States and the majority of the employees working in the Pet Care business. The agreement included an option for Mars to acquire the Pet Care business in several additional countries, which were substantially completed as of June 30, 2015. The European Union countries were not included in the agreement with Mars. In December 2014, the Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care operations in Western Europe to Spectrum Brands in an all-cash transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, Spectrum Brands acquired our branded pet care products, our manufacturing site in the Netherlands, and the majority of the employees working in the Western Europe Pet Care business. The one-time after-tax impact of these transactions is not material. The Pet Care business had historically been part of the Companys Health Care reportable segment. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Pet Care business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Additionally, the Pet Care balance sheet positions as of June 30, 2014 are presented as assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Procter  Gamble Company 72 NOTE 14 SUBSEQUENT EVENT On July 9, 2015 , the Company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to divest four product categories, comprised of 43 of its beauty brands (Beauty Brands), which will be merged with Coty, Inc. (Coty). While the ultimate form of the transaction has not yet been decided, the Companys current preference is for a Reverse Morris Trust split-off transaction in which PG shareholders could elect to participate in an exchange offer to exchange PG shares for Coty shares. The transaction includes the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. Combined, the Beauty Brands had $5.5 billion in net sales for the year ended June 30, 2015 . The Company expects to close the transaction in the second half of calendar year 2016 , pending regulatory approvals. Cotys offer for the Beauty Brands, which was accepted by the Company, was $12.5 billion . While the final value of the transaction will be determined at closing, based on Cotys stock price and outstanding shares and equity grants as of the date of signing, the value of the transaction was approximately $15.0 billion . The value is comprised of approximately 413 million shares, or 52% of the diluted equity of the newly combined company, valued at approximately $13.1 billion and the assumption of debt of $1.9 billion by the entity holding the beauty businesses immediately prior to close of the transaction. The assumed debt is expected to vary between $3.9 billion and $1.9 billion , depending on a $22.06 to $27.06 per share collar of Cotys stock based on the trading price prior to the close of the transaction, but will be subject to other contractual valuation adjustments. Beginning in the quarter ending September 30, 2015 , the Beauty Brands will be reported as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements, with prior year periods restated to reflect the same treatment.

The purpose of this plan is to advance the interests of the Company by giving substantially all employees a stake in the Company's future growth and success and to strengthen the alignment of interests between employees and the Company's shareholders through increased ownership of shares of the Company's stock. The plan has not been submitted to shareholders for approval. Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company's capitalization, the number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 17 million shares. Under the plan's regulations, recipients are granted options to acquire 100 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price equal to the average price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant. These options vest five years after the date of grant and expire ten years following the date of grant. If a recipient leaves the employ of the Company prior to the vesting date for a reason other than disability, retirement or special separation (as defined in the plan), then the award is forfeited. At the time of the first grant following Board approval of the plan, each employee of the Company not eligible for an award under the 1992 Stock Plan was granted options for 100 shares. From the date of this first grant through June 30, 2003, each new employee of the Company has also received options for 100 shares. Following the grant of options on June 30, 2003, the Company suspended this part of the plan. The plan terminated on October 13, 2007. The Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan Shareholders of The Gillette Company approved The Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan on May 20, 2004, and the plan was assumed by the Company upon the merger between The Procter  Gamble Company and The Gillette Company. All options became immediately vested and exercisable on October 1, 2005 as a result of the merger. After the merger, all outstanding options became options to purchase shares of The Procter  Gamble Company subject to an exchange ratio of .975 shares of PG stock per share of Gillette stock. Only employees previously employed by The Gillette Company prior to October 1, 2005 are eligible to receive grants under this plan. The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate employees of The Gillette Company and, until the effective date of the merger between The Gillette Company and The Procter  Gamble Company, non-employee members of the Gillette Board of Directors. Under the plan, eligible participants are: (i) granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii) granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii) granted shares of the Company's common stock or restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents). Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company's capitalization and the addition of any shares authorized but not issued or redeemed under The Gillette Company 1971 Stock Option Plan, the number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 19,000,000 shares. 75 The Procter  Gamble Company Except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights must expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan must be equal to or greater than the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of grant. Any common stock awarded under the plan may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the committee administering the plan may determine. If a recipient of a grant leaves the Company while holding an unexercised option or right: (1) any unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement, special separation (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has waived the termination provisions; and (2) any exercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement, special separation, voluntary resignation that is not for Good Reason (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has waived the termination provisions.

Business. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Management's Discussion and Analysis (MDA); and Notes 1 and 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the \"Company,\" \"PG,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" as used herein refer to The Procter  Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries. The Procter  Gamble Company is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world's consumers. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having been built from a business founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. Today, our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories. Throughout this Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains these reports at: www.sec.gov. You can also access these reports through links from our website at: www.pginvestor.com. Copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting Wells Fargo, 1100 Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota, MN 55120-4100. Financial Information about Segments As of June 30, 2016 the Company has five reportable segments under U.S. GAAP: Beauty ; Grooming ; Health Care ; Fabric  Home Care ; and Baby, Feminine  Family Care . Many of the factors necessary for understanding these businesses are similar. Operating margins of the individual businesses vary due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products, the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. Net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets and product categories in which they operate. While none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components within certain reportable segments, such as Appliances (Grooming), are seasonal. Additional information about our reportable segments can be found in the MDA and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Narrative Description of Business Business Model . Our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products, as well as the creation of new products. The markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We utilize our superior marketing and online presence to win with consumers at the \"zero moment of truth\" - when they are searching for information about a brand or product. We work collaboratively with our customers to improve the in-store presence of our products and win the \"first moment of truth\" - when a consumer is shopping in the store. We must also win the \"second moment of truth\" - when a consumer uses the product, evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and decides whether it was a good value. We believe we must continue to provide new, innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business. Research and product development activities, designed to enable sustained organic growth, continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year. Key Product Categories . Information on key product categories can be found in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Key Customers . Our customers include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 15% of our total revenue in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . No other customer represents more than 10% of our net sales. Our top ten customers account for approximately 35% of our total sales in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . The nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government. We believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete. Sources and Availability of Materials . Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from others, some of which are single-source suppliers. We produce certain raw materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing process and in the transportation of input materials and of finished product to customers. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers. The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, none of which is material to our business taken as a whole. Trademarks and Patents . We own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. All major trademarks in each business are registered. 2 The Procter  Gamble Company In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses. Competitive Condition . The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. We support our products with advertising, promotions and other marketing vehicles to build awareness and trial of our brands and products in conjunction with an extensive sales force. We believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products. Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important differentiating factors. Research and Development Expenditures . Research and development expenditures enable us to develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of our consumers. Research and development expenses were $1.9 billion in 2016 , $2.0 billion in 2015 and $1.9 billion in 2014 (reported in Net earnings from continuing operations). Expenditures for Environmental Compliance .  Expenditures for compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not material to the Company. No material change is expected in fiscal year 2017 . Employees . Total number of employees is an estimate of total Company employees excluding interns, co-ops and employees of joint ventures as of the years ended June 30. The number of employees includes manufacturing and non-manufacturing employees. A discussion of progress on non-manufacturing enrollment objectives is included in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The number of employees includes employees of discontinued operations. ##TABLE_START  Total Number of Employees 105,000 110,000 118,000 121,000 126,000 129,000 ##TABLE_ENDFinancial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations. Net sales in the U.S. account for 41% of total net sales. No other individual country exceeds 10% of total net sales. Operations outside the U.S. are generally characterized by the same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may be affected by additional factors including changing currency values, different rates of inflation, economic growth and political and economic uncertainties and disruptions.

Risk Factors. We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-K, quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. The following discussion of risk factors identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with the MDA and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes incorporated in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. The Procter  Gamble Company 3 Our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility. We are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world. We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our operations outside the U.S. generate a significant portion of our net revenue. Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies, such as the recent volatility in the Russian ruble, may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in U.S. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition. Moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies in different countries could adversely affect our results. See also the Results of Operations and Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity sections of the MDA and Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls, including Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria and Ukraine. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business outside the U.S. Additionally, our business, operations or employees may be adversely affected by political volatility, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval, broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments, particularly in emerging markets. Uncertain global economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, which could adversely impact our business. Our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic disruptions, such as: a slow-down in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers; or the inability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. Additionally, economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third party partners to suffer financial difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles. If we are unable to generate sufficient income and cash flow, it could affect the Companys ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments. Disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit. A disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. Disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results. Our ability to meet our customers needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of our previously-announced supply chain simplifications and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. The loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare. Therefore, our business results are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our financial results. Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation . We are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. Achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. The success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. We must also be able to successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors. Failure to continually innovate, improve and 4 The Procter  Gamble Company respond to competitive moves could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels. The consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins.  To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms. In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce, could negatively impact our results. A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued consolidation among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of our products or experience a significant business disruption. If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. The Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition, and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer. Our Company also devotes significant time and resources to programs that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. If these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, the Company's reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. Due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners or external business partners, for certain functions. If we are unable to effectively manage our third party relationships and the agreements under which our third party partners operate, our financial results could suffer. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, hardware, processes, associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. We rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems, networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. The various uses of these IT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: ##TABLE_START  ordering and managing materials from suppliers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  converting materials to finished products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  shipping products to customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  marketing and selling products to consumers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  collecting, transferring, storing, and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor, regulatory, and other stakeholder information and personal data; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  summarizing and reporting results of operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company 5 ##TABLE_START  collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  providing data security; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  handling other processes necessary to manage our business. ##TABLE_END Numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our IT systems, networks and services, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and the availability and integrity of our critical business operations. As cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally, the Company is continually increasing its sensitivity and attention to these threats. We continue to assess potential threats and make investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems and upgrading skills, employee training and security policies for the Company and its third-party providers. However, because the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. Our IT databases and systems and our third party providers' databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing and other cyber-attacks. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks; however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third party providers will prevent breaches or breakdowns to our or our third-party providers databases or systems. If the IT systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss, significant unavailability of or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. The costs and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. We must successfully manage compliance with legislation, regulation and enforcement, as well as pending legal matters in the U.S. and abroad. Our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across all of the countries in which we do business, including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property, product liability, marketing, antitrust, privacy, environmental, employment, anti-bribery or anti-corruption (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), tax or other matters. Rapidly changing laws, regulations and related interpretations, including changes in accounting standards, as well as increased enforcement actions, create challenges for the Company, including our compliance and ethics programs and may alter the environment in which we do business, which could adversely impact our financial results. If we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. Failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. Furthermore, if pending legal matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Changes in applicable tax regulations could negatively affect our financial results. The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Because the U.S. maintains a worldwide corporate tax system, the foreign and U.S. tax systems are somewhat interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the U.S. is not taxed in the U.S., provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. If those same foreign earnings are instead repatriated to the U.S., additional residual U.S. taxation will likely occur, due to the U.S.s worldwide tax system and higher U.S. corporate tax rate. The U.S. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly change the corporate tax rate and the U.S. international tax rules. Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each countrys jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving as a result of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (BEPS\") undertaken by the G8, G20 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\"OECD\"). As these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results. If we are unable to successfully execute our portfolio optimization strategy, as well as successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities, it could adversely impact our business. In August 2014, the Company announced a plan to significantly streamline our product portfolio by divesting, discontinuing or consolidating about 100 non-strategic brands, resulting in a portfolio of about 65 brands. The Company has announced the Beauty Brands transaction with Coty and completed a series of other transactions that will substantially complete this plan. Our ability to successfully execute our portfolio optimization strategy could impact our results. In addition, as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business 6 The Procter  Gamble Company objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands. Our financial results could also be impacted in the event of acquisitions or joint venture activities if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets. Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change. Our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings, including staffing adjustments as well as employee departures. Failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings, while continuing to invest in business growth, could adversely impact our financial results. Additionally, successfully executing management transitions at leadership levels of the Company and retention of key employees is critical to our business success. We are generally a build-from-within company and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense, as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans. The United Kingdoms departure from the European Union could adversely impact our business and financial results. On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which a majority of voters voted for the United Kingdom to exit the  European Union (Brexit), the announcement of which resulted in significant currency exchange  rate fluctuations and volatility in global stock markets. It is expected that the British government will commence negotiations to determine the terms of Brexit. Given  the lack of comparable precedent, the implications of Brexit or how such implications might affect the Company are unclear. Brexit could, among other things, disrupt trade and the free movement of goods, services and  people between the United Kingdom and the European Union or other countries as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty. These and other potential implications of Brexit could adversely affect the Companys business and financial results. ", "1B": " Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. ", "2": " Item 2. Properties.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Management's Discussion and Analysis Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including, without limitation, in the following sections: Management's Discussion and Analysis and Risk Factors. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believe, project, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, strategy, future, opportunity, plan, may, should, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled \"Economic Conditions and Uncertainties\" and the section titled Risk Factors (Item 1A of this Form 10-K). Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MDA) is to provide an understanding of Procter  Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MDA is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The MDA is organized in the following sections: ##TABLE_START  Overview ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Summary of 2016 Results ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Economic Conditions and Uncertainties ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Results of Operations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Segment Results ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Information ##TABLE_END Throughout the MDA, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of the Venezuela deconsolidation, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and certain divestiture impacts. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of the MDA provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MDA are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category. OVERVIEW PG is a global leader in fast-moving consumer goods, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. 12 The Procter  Gamble Company ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE Our organizational structure is comprised of Global Business Units (GBUs), Selling and Market Operations (SMOs), Global Business Services (GBS) and Corporate Functions (CF). Global Business Units Our GBUs are organized into ten product categories. Under U.S. GAAP, the GBUs underlying the ten product categories are aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty ; Grooming ; Health Care ; Fabric  Home Care ; and Baby, Feminine  Family Care . The GBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the ten product categories and brand composition within each segment. ##TABLE_START  Reportable Segments % of Net Sales 1 % of Net Earnings 1 Product Categories (Sub-Categories) Major Brands  Beauty 18% 20% Hair Care ( Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments ) Head  Shoulders, Pantene, Rejoice  Skin and Personal Care ( Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care ) Olay, Old Spice, Safeguard, SK-II  Grooming 11% 15% Grooming 2 (Shave Care - Female Blades  Razors, Male Blades  Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care; Appliances) Braun, Fusion, Gillette, Mach3, Prestobarba, Venus   Health Care 11% 12% Oral Care ( Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care ) Crest, Oral-B  Personal Health Care ( Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care ) Prilosec, Vicks  Fabric  Home Care 32% 27% Fabric Care ( Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents ) Ariel, Downy, Gain, Tide  Home Care ( Air Care, Dish Care, PG Professional, Surface Care ) Cascade, Dawn, Febreze, Mr. Clean, Swiffer  Baby, Feminine  Family Care 28% 26% Baby Care ( Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants ) Luvs, Pampers  Feminine Care ( Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care ) Always, Tampax  Family Care ( Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper ) Bounty, Charmin ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Percent of Net sales and Net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2016 (excluding results held in Corporate). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The Grooming product category is comprised of the Shave Care and Appliances GBUs.   ##TABLE_END Recent Developments: As of June 30, 2015, the Company deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. This change resulted in a fiscal 2015 one-time after-tax charge of $2.1 billion ($0.71 per share). Beginning in fiscal 2016, our financial results only include sales of finished goods to our Venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent we receive cash payments from Venezuela (expected to be largely through the DIPRO and DICOM exchange market). Accordingly, we no longer include the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries' operations in reporting periods following fiscal 2015 (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and additional discussion in the MDA under \"Venezuela Impacts\" in Results of Operations). In August 2014, the Company announced a plan to significantly streamline our product portfolio by divesting, discontinuing or consolidating about 100 non-strategic brands. The resulting portfolio of about 65 key brands are in 10 category-based businesses where PG has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies. During fiscal 2016, the company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business. The Batteries business had historically been part of the Companys Fabric  Home Care reportable segment. The results of the Batteries business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Additionally, the Batteries balance sheet positions as of June 30, 2015 are presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On July 9, 2015, the Company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to divest four product categories, to Coty Inc. (\"Coty\"). Coty's offer was $12.5 billion. The divestiture was initially comprised of 43 of the Company's beauty brands (\"Beauty Brands\"), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. Subsequent to signing, two of the fine fragrance brands, Dolce Gabbana and Christina Aguilera, were excluded from the divestiture. While the ultimate form of the transaction has not yet been decided, the Companys current preference is for a Reverse The Procter  Gamble Company 13 Morris Trust split-off transaction in which PG shareholders could elect to participate in an exchange offer to exchange their PG shares for Coty shares. The Company expects to complete this transaction in October 2016. The results of the Beauty Brands are now presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Additionally, the Beauty Brands' balance sheet positions as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 are presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During fiscal 2015, the Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care business. The gain on the transaction was not material. The results of the Pet Care business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. With these transactions and other recent minor brand divestitures, the Company will have substantially completed the strategic portfolio reshaping program. Beauty : We are a global market leader in the beauty category. Most of the beauty markets in which we compete are highly fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. We compete in skin and personal care and in hair care. In skin and personal care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to personal cleansing to skin care, such as our Olay brand, which is one of the top facial skin care brands in the world with over 7% global market share. In hair care, we compete in the retail channel. We are the global market leader in the retail hair care market with over 20% global market share primarily behind our Pantene and Head  Shoulders brands. Grooming : We compete in Shave Care and Appliances. In Shave Care, we are the global market leader in the blades and razors market. Our global blades and razors market share is nearly 65%, primarily behind the Gillette franchise including Fusion, Mach3, Prestobarba and Venus. Our appliances, such as electric razors and epilators, are sold under the Braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. We hold over 20% of the male shavers market and nearly 45% of the female epilators market. Health Care : We compete in oral care and personal health care. In oral care, there are several global competitors in the market and we have the number two market share position with nearly 20% global market share behind our Oral-B and Crest brands. In personal health care, we are a top ten competitor in a large, highly fragmented industry, primarily behind respiratory treatments (Vicks brand), nonprescription heartburn medications (Prilosec OTC brand) and digestive wellness products (Metamucil, Pepto Bismol, and Align brands). Nearly all of our sales outside the U.S. in personal health care are generated through the PGT Healthcare partnership with Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Fabric  Home Care : This segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products including laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; and home care products including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners. In fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two market share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader with nearly 30% global market share, primarily behind our Tide, Ariel and Downy brands. Our global home care market share is nearly 25% across the categories in which we compete. Baby, Feminine  Family Care : In baby care, we compete mainly in diapers, pants and baby wipes with nearly 30% global market share. We are the number one or number two baby care competitor in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind Pampers, the Company's largest brand, with annual net sales of nearly $9 billion. We are the global market leader in the feminine care category with over 25% global market share, primarily behind Always. We also compete in the adult incontinence category in certain markets, achieving over 10% market share in the markets where we compete. Our family care business is predominantly a North American business comprised largely of the Bounty paper towel and Charmin toilet paper brands. U.S. market shares are over 40% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin. Selling and Market Operations Our SMOs are responsible for developing and executing go-to-market plans at the local level. The SMOs include dedicated retail customer, trade channel and country-specific teams. Our SMOs are organized under six regions comprised of North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Greater China and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA). Throughout the MDA, we reference business results in developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan, and developing markets which are all other markets not included in developed. Global Business Services GBS provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the GBUs and the SMOs to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment. Corporate Functions CF provides company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources and legal, as well as other centralized functional support. STRATEGIC FOCUS PG aspires to serve the worlds consumers better than our best competitors in every category and in every country in which we compete, and, as a result, deliver total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. Delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top-line growth, bottom-line growth and strong cash generation. Our strategic choices are focused on winning with consumers. The consumers who purchase and use our products are at the center of everything we do. We increase the number of users - and the usage - of our brands when we win at the zero, first and second moments of truth: when consumers research our 14 The Procter  Gamble Company categories and brands, purchase them in a store or online and use them in their homes. Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires innovation. Innovation has always been, and continues to be, PGs lifeblood. Innovation requires consumer insights and technology advancements that lead to product improvements, improved marketing and merchandising programs and game-changing inventions that create new brands and categories. Productivity improvement is critical to delivering our balanced top-line growth, bottom-line growth and value creation objectives. Productivity improvement and sales growth reinforce and fuel each other. We are driving productivity improvement across all elements of cost, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional expenses and non-manufacturing overhead. Productivity improvements and cost savings are being reinvested in product and packaging improvements, brand awareness-building advertising and trial-building sampling programs, increased sales coverage and RD programs. We are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs. The Company has undertaken an effort to focus and strengthen its business portfolio to compete in categories and with brands that are structurally attractive and that play to PG's strengths. The ongoing portfolio of businesses consists of 10 product categories. These are categories where PG has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies. We believe these strategies are right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term annual financial targets will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive peer group: ##TABLE_START  Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Core EPS growth of mid-to-high single digits; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater. ##TABLE_END In periods with significant macroeconomic pressures, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to investing so as not to sacrifice the long-term health of our businesses to meet short-term objectives in any given year.

Organic volume declined 1%. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net earnings from continuing operations increased $1.7 billion or 21% in fiscal 2016 due to a $2.1 billion after-tax charge in the prior year related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries and improved gross margin, partially offset by the earnings impact of the decline in net sales. Foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings from continuing operations by $880 million or approximately 11%. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $1.7 billion due primarily to the net impact of a gain on the sale of our Batteries business in fiscal 2016 and higher impairment charges on that business in the prior period. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble were $10.5 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion or 49% versus the prior year due to the aforementioned increases in net earnings from both continuing and discontinued operations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted net earnings per share increased 51% to $3.69. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 23% to $3.49. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Core EPS decreased 2% to $3.67. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash flow from operating activities was $15.4 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adjusted free cash flow was $12.1 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 115%. ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company 15 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are \"forward-looking statements\" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. Global Economic Conditions.  Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-producing economies as commodity prices decline, greater political unrest in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, further economic instability in the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American markets and economic slowdowns in Japan and China, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings. Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings. Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. As discussed later in the MDA, we initiated certain non-manufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvements projects in 2012. If we are not successful in executing these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings. Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia and Turkey have had, and could have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Increased pricing in response to these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts, but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales. Government Policies. Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies. For example, the U.S. may consider corporate tax reform that could significantly impact the corporate tax rate and change the U.S. tax treatment of international earnings. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt and currency exposure in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria and Ukraine. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SGA), other non-operating items and income taxes. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, the level of initiatives and other activities by competitors, geographic expansion and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the U.S. Most of our cost of products sold and SGA are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary drivers of SGA are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. Overhead costs are also variable in nature, but on a relative basis, less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth. Accordingly, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs. 16 The Procter  Gamble Company The Company is in the midst of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, marketing and overhead expenses. The plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. Net Sales Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  Net sales decreased 8% to $65.3 billion in 2016 on a 3% decrease in unit volume versus the prior year period. Volume decreased low single digits in Grooming, Health Care, Fabric  Home Care and Baby, Feminine  Family Care and decreased mid-single digits in Beauty. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and declined high single digits in developing regions, in part due to increased pricing to address foreign exchange devaluations and due to the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. Organic volume declined mid-single digits in developing markets. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 6%, while higher pricing drove a 1% favorable impact on net sales. Organic volume decreased 1% and organic sales grew 1% driven by higher pricing. Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014  Net sales decreased 5% to $70.7 billion in 2015 on a 1% decrease in unit volume versus the prior year period. Volume grew low single digits in Fabric  Home Care. Volume decreased low single digits in Baby, Feminine  Family Care, Grooming, Health Care and Beauty. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and declined low single digits in developing regions due, in part, to increased pricing to address foreign exchange devaluations. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 6%, while higher pricing drove a 2% favorable impact on net sales. Favorable product mix impact of 1% was offset by acquisition and divestiture activity. Organic volume decreased 1% and organic sales grew 2% driven by higher pricing.

Gross margin increased primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  a 210 basis point positive impact from manufacturing cost savings, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 110 basis point benefit from lower commodity costs and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 70 basis point benefit of higher pricing. ##TABLE_END These impacts were partially offset by: ##TABLE_START  a 70 basis point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 70 basis point decrease due to unfavorable product mix caused by the disproportionate decline of higher margin segments like Beauty and by product form mix within the segments, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 20 basis point decrease from negative scale impacts due to lower volume and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 20 basis point decline due to incremental restructuring activity. ##TABLE_END Total SGA decreased 8% to $18.9 billion primarily due to reduced overhead spending and a decrease in foreign exchange transaction charges. SGA as a percentage of net sales declined 10 basis points to 29.0%, as the negative scale impacts of lower net sales and inflationary impacts were more than offset by cost savings efforts, mainly in overhead spending, and lower foreign exchange transactional charges. ##TABLE_START  Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 90 basis points due to the negative scale impacts from reduced sales. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points, as 90 basis points of productivity savings were partially offset by wage inflation, increased sales personnel in certain businesses, investments in research and development and the negative scale impacts from reduced sales. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Lower foreign exchange transactional charges reduced SGA as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points. A pre-deconsolidation balance sheet remeasurement charge in Venezuela in the base period drove 20 basis points of this decline. The balance of the reduction relates to lower transactional charges from revaluing receivables and payables from transactions denominated in a currency other than a local entitys functional currency. ##TABLE_END The Procter  Gamble Company 17 Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014  Gross margin increased 10 basis points to 47.6% of net sales in 2015 . Gross margin benefited from: ##TABLE_START  a 200 basis point impact from manufacturing cost savings and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 90 basis point benefit from higher pricing. ##TABLE_END These impacts were partially offset by: ##TABLE_START  a 110 basis point impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix, primarily from declines in the higher than average margin Beauty and Grooming segments as well as within the Fabric  Home Care and Grooming segments, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 50 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 40 basis point impact from costs related to initiatives and capacity investments, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 30 basis point impact from higher restructuring costs and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  smaller impacts from lower volume scale and higher commodity costs. ##TABLE_END Total SGA decreased 4% to $ 20.6 billion , as reduced overhead and marketing spending was partially offset by increased foreign exchange transaction charges. SGA as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points to 29.1% , as the negative scale impacts of lower net sales and inflationary impacts were partially offset by cost savings efforts. ##TABLE_START  Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points behind lower spending due to efficiency efforts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Overhead spending as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points as productivity savings of 60 basis points from reduced overhead spending were more than offset by wage inflation, investments in research and development, the negative scale impacts of lower net sales and higher restructuring costs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Increased foreign exchange transaction charges added approximately 40 basis points to SGA as a percentage of net sales, as current year foreign currency transaction charges (from revaluing receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than a local entitys functional currency) were partially offset by lower year-on-year charges for Venezuela remeasurement and devaluation. ##TABLE_END During fiscal 2015, the Company incurred a $2.0 billion ($2.1 billion after tax) charge related to the deconsolidation of its Venezuelan subsidiaries. See the Venezuela Impacts later in the Results of Operations section. Non-Operating Items Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  ##TABLE_START  Interest expense was $579 million in 2016 , a decrease of $47 million versus the prior year due to lower average debt balances. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interest income was $182 million in 2016 , an increase of $33 million versus the prior year primarily due to increasing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other non-operating income, which primarily includes divestiture gains and investment income, decreased $115 million to $325 million, due primarily to lower gains on minor brand divestitures. In 2016 , we had approximately $300 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Escudo and certain hair care brands in Europe and IMEA. The prior year acquisition and divestiture activities included approximately $450 million in divestiture gains, including Zest, Camay, Fekkai and Wash  Go hair care brands and Vaposteam. ##TABLE_END Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014  ##TABLE_START  Interest expense was $ 626 million in 2015 a decrease of $83 million versus the prior year due to lower average debt balances and a decrease in weighted average interest rates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interest income was $ 149 million in 2015 , an increase of $50 million versus the prior year due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other non-operating income increased $231 million to $440 million, primarily due to minor brand divestiture gains. In 2015 , we had approximately $450 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Zest, Camay, Fekkai and Wash  Go hair care brands and Vaposteam. The prior year acquisition and divestiture activities included approximately $150 million in divestiture gains, primarily related to the sale of our bleach businesses in Europe, IMEA and Latin America, our Pert hair care business in Latin America and MDVIP. ##TABLE_END Income Taxes Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 30 basis points to 25.0% in 2016 mainly due to a 260 basis point negative impact from the unfavorable geographic mix of earnings, a 130 basis point impact in the current year from the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and the impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to 55 basis points in the current year versus 85 basis points in the prior year), partially offset by a 400 basis point decrease related to the prior year non-deductibility of the Venezuelan deconsolidation charge. Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014  The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 360 basis points to 24.7% in 2015 mainly due to the non-deductibility of the $2.0 billion Venezuelan deconsolidation charge. The rate increase caused by lower favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions (the net benefit was 80 basis points in fiscal 2015 versus 170 basis points in fiscal 2014) was largely offset by a decrease related to favorable geographic earnings mix. Net Earnings Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  Net earnings from continuing operations increased $1.7 billion or 21% to $10.0 billion primarily due to the base period charge of $2.1 billion after-tax related to the deconsolidation of 18 The Procter  Gamble Company Venezuelan subsidiaries. Earnings also declined due to the impact of the decline in net sales in fiscal 2016, partially offset by improved gross margin and the reduction in SGA. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by about $880 million in 2016 due to weakening of certain key currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Russia. This impact includes both transactional charges as discussed above in Operating Costs and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings from discontinued operations improved $1.7 billion in 2016 to $577 million. Batteries drove a $2.1 billion improvement due primarily to a $1.8 billion reduction in after-tax impairment charges in the Batteries business ($350 million in the current year compared to $2.1 billion in the base period) and a $422 million after-tax gain in the current period from the sale of the Batteries business. This was partially offset by a decrease in the earnings of the Beauty Brands (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble increased $3.5 billion, or 49% to $10.5 billion. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.65, or 23%, to $3.49 due to the increase in net earnings and a decline in the average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.20 primarily resulting from the gain on the sale of the Batteries business. This was an improvement of $0.60 per share versus the prior year. Diluted net earnings per share increased $1.25, or 51%, to $3.69. Core EPS decreased 2% to $3.67. Core EPS in fiscal year 2016 represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges for certain European legal matters and incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan. The decline was driven by reduced net sales and foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by gross margin expansion. Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014  Net earnings from continuing operations decreased $2.4 billion or 22% to $8.3 billion due to the $2.1 billion after-tax charge related to the deconsolidation of Venezuelan subsidiaries and the decline in net sales, partially offset by reduced SGA. Foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately $1.3 billion in 2015 due to the weakening of certain key currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily in Russia, Ukraine, Venezuela and Argentina, partially offset by lower after-tax charges related to balance sheet remeasurement charges in Venezuela. Net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $2.3 billion in 2015 due primarily to $2.1 billion of after-tax impairment charges in our Batteries business (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and the absence of fiscal 2015 earnings from our divested Pet Care business. Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble decreased $4.6 billion, or 40% to $7.0 billion. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $0.79, or 22%, to $2.84 due to the decrease in net earnings. We had a diluted net loss per share from discontinued operations of $0.40 due primarily to the impairment charges on the Batteries business. This was a reduction of $0.78 per share versus the prior year. Diluted net earnings per share decreased $1.57, or 39%, to $2.44. Core EPS decreased 2% to $3.76. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges for Venezuelan deconsolidation, balance sheet remeasurement charges from foreign exchange policy changes and devaluation in Venezuela, charges for certain European legal matters and incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan. The decline was driven by reduced net sales, partially offset by minor brand divestiture gains. Venezuela Impacts There are a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions in Venezuela, which have evolved over time and may continue to evolve in the future. These evolving conditions resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar and restricted our Venezuelan operations ability to pay dividends or pay for certain raw and package materials, finished goods and services denominated in U.S. dollars. For accounting purposes, this resulted in a lack of control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Therefore, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation, effective June 30, 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. This resulted in a write-off of all of the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries, along with Venezuela related assets held by other subsidiaries. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2016, our financial results only include sales of finished goods to our Venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent we receive payments from Venezuela. Accordingly, we no longer include the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries operations in our financial results. The Procter  Gamble Company 19 SEGMENT RESULTS Segment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs such as interest expense, investing activities and certain restructuring and asset impairment costs. These costs are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, as described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments. Eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate. All references to net earnings throughout the discussion of segment results refer to net earnings from continuing operations. ##TABLE_START Net Sales Change Drivers 2016 vs. 2015*  Volume with Acquisitions  Divestitures  Volume Excluding Acquisitions  Divestitures  Foreign Exchange  Price  Mix  Other**  Net Sales Growth Beauty (5 )%  (2 )%  (6 )%  %   %   %  (9 )% Grooming (2 )%  (2 )%  (9 )%  %  (2 )%   %  (8 )% Health Care (2 )%  (2 )%  (6 )%  %  %   %  (5 )% Fabric  Home Care (1 )%  %  (6 )%   %   %   %  (7 )% Baby, Feminine  Family Care (3 )%  (2 )%  (6 )%   %   %   %  (9 )% TOTAL COMPANY (3 )%  (1 )%  (6 )%  %   %   %  (8 )% ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net Sales Change Drivers 2015 vs. 2014*  Volume with Acquisitions  Divestitures  Volume Excluding Acquisitions  Divestitures  Foreign Exchange  Price  Mix  Other**  Net Sales Growth Beauty (3 )%  (2 )%  (5 )%  %   %   %  (6 )% Grooming (3 )%  (3 )%  (8 )%  %   %   %  (7 )% Health Care (1 )%  (1 )%  (5 )%  %  %   %  (1 )% Fabric  Home Care %  %  (6 )%  %   %  (1 )%  (5 )% Baby, Feminine  Family Care (1 )%  (1 )%  (6 )%  %  %   %  (3 )% TOTAL COMPANY (1 )%  (1 )%  (6 )%  %  %  (1 )%  (5 )% ##TABLE_END* Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. ** Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales.

Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 6%. Price increases had a 2% positive impact on net sales. Organic sales were unchanged on organic volume that decreased 2%. Global market share of the Beauty segment decreased 1.0 points. Volume decreased low single digits in developed markets and decreased high single digits in developing markets. ##TABLE_START  Volume in Hair Care was down mid-single digits. Developed markets declined mid-single digits due to competitive activity while developing markets declined mid-single digits driven by increased pricing, the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. Global market share of the hair care category decreased more than a point.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Volume in Skin and Personal Care decreased high single digits, while organic volume decreased low single digits, with the difference attributable to the Camay and Zest brand divestitures and the Venezuela deconsolidation. Organic volume was unchanged in developed regions as commercial innovation was offset by ongoing competitive activity. Organic volume declined mid-single digits in developing regions primarily due to increased pricing and competitive activity. Global market share of the skin and personal care category decreased nearly a point. ##TABLE_END20 The Procter  Gamble Company Net earnings decreased 9% to $2.0 billion primarily due to the reduction in net sales, along with a 10 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due to an increase in SGA as a percentage of net sales, largely offset by gross margin expansion. Gross margin improved due to productivity savings, increased pricing and lower commodity costs, partially offset by negative mix. SGA as a percentage of net sales increased as lower marketing and overhead spending from the Company's focus on efficiencies was more than offset by the negative scale impacts from the reduction in sales.  Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014  Beauty net sales decreased 6% to $12.6 billion in 2015 on a 3% decrease in unit volume. Organic sales were unchanged on a 2% decline in organic volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 5%. Increased pricing was a benefit of 2%. Global market share of the Beauty segment decreased 0.6 points. Volume decreased low single digits in developed markets and was down mid-single digits in developing markets.  ##TABLE_START  Volume in Hair Care decreased low single digits in both developed and developing markets following minor divestitures and competitive activity. Global market share of the hair care category was down more than half a point.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Volume in Skin and Personal Care was down mid-single digits, driven by a high single-digits decline in developing markets, primarily due to decreases in skin care and personal cleansing due to ongoing competitive activity. Volume was unchanged in developed markets. Global market share of the skin and personal care category was down half a point.  ##TABLE_END Net earnings decreased 5% to $2.2 billion primarily due to lower volume and the currency-driven reduction in net sales. Net earnings margin increased 10 basis points primarily due to a reduction in SGA as a percent of sales, behind lower spending from the Company's focus on marketing efficiencies.

Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 9%. Price increases in Shave Care contributed 5% to net sales. Unfavorable product mix decreased net sales by 2% due to a higher relative mix of disposable razors, which have lower than segment average selling prices compared to system razor cartridges. Organic sales increased 2%. Global market share of the Grooming segment decreased 1.1 points. Volume decreased low single digits in developed and developing regions.  ##TABLE_START  Shave Care volume decreased low single digits in both developed and developing regions due to competitive activity and increased pricing. Global market share of the shave care category decreased more than half a point.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Volume in Appliances was up mid-single digits due to a mid-single-digit increase in developed regions from product innovation. Volume in developing regions increased low single digits due to growth from product innovation, partially offset by reductions due to increased pricing. Global market share of the Appliances category decreased more than half a point.  ##TABLE_END Net earnings decreased 13% to $1.5 billion due to the reduction in net sales and a 130 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due to increased SGA as a percentage of net sales partially offset by a lower tax rate. Gross margin was unchanged as the benefits of increased pricing and productivity efforts were largely offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and negative product mix caused by an increase in the proportion of disposable razor sales compared to system razor cartridges. SGA as a percentage of net sales increased due to increased marketing spending and the negative scale impact of lower net sales. The tax rate declined due to the geographic mix of earnings.  Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014  Grooming net sales decreased 7% to $7.4 billion in 2015 on a 3% decrease in unit volume. Organic sales increased 1%.

These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization; certain significant asset impairment and deconsolidation charges; and certain balance sheet impacts from significant foreign exchange devaluations. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item includes income taxes to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Corporate net sales decreased $44 million during the fiscal year. Corporate net earnings from continuing operations improved by approximately $2.2 billion during the fiscal year, primarily due to the $2.1 billion Venezuela deconsolidation charge in the prior fiscal year and lower foreign currency transactional charges. Additional discussion of these items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section. Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 Net sales in Corporate decreased by $271 million in 2015 primarily due to the prior year divestiture of the MDVIP business. Corporate net expenses from continuing operations increased $2.0 billion in 2015, primarily due to the charge related to the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiaries, increased foreign exchange transactional charges and incremental restructuring charges, which were partially offset by gains on minor brand divestitures. Productivity and Cost Savings Plan In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. As part of this plan, the Company expects to incur approximately $5.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a six-year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017). Through the end of fiscal 2016 , 89% of the expected costs have been incurred. Savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. Overall, these costs and other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions are expected to deliver approximately $3.0 billion in annual before-tax gross savings. The cumulative before-tax savings realized through 2016 were approximately $2.4 billion . Restructuring accruals of $315 million as of June 30, 2016 are classified as current liabilities. During fiscal 2016 , 51% of the restructuring charges incurred either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program and to the Operating Costs section of the MDA for more information about the total benefit to operating margins from our total savings efforts. CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations. Operating Cash Flow Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  Operating cash flow was $15.4 billion in 2016 , a 6% increase from the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes, loss/(gain) on sale of businesses and impairment charges) generated $13.6 billion of operating cash 24 The Procter  Gamble Company flow. Working capital and other impacts generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow. ##TABLE_START  Reduced accounts receivable generated $35 million of cash due to improved collection results partially offset by sales mix. The number of days sales outstanding increased 1 day due to foreign exchange impacts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Lower inventory generated $116 million of cash mainly due to supply chain optimizations and lower commodity costs. Inventory days on hand increased 4 days primarily due to foreign exchange impacts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $1.3 billion in operating cash flow, of which approximately $0.8 billion was driven by extended payment terms with our suppliers. The balance was primarily driven by an increase in fourth quarter marketing activity versus the prior year. These items, along with the impact of foreign exchange, drove a 24 day increase in days payable outstanding. Although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics, we anticipate similar cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers over the next fiscal year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other operating assets and liabilities generated $204 million of cash. ##TABLE_END Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014  Operating cash flow was $14.6 billion in 2015 , a 5% increase from the prior year. Operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes, impairment charges, gains on sale of businesses and the Venezuela deconsolidation charge) and a decrease in working capital, partially offset by the impact of other operating assets and liabilities. ##TABLE_START  Reduced accounts receivable generated $349 million of cash due to changes in customer terms and improved collection results. The number of days sales outstanding decreased 5 days due to foreign exchange impacts and improvements in collection results and customer terms. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Lower inventory generated $313 million of cash mainly due to supply chain optimizations and lower commodity costs. Inventory days on hand decreased 7 days due to foreign exchange impacts, supply chain optimizations and lower commodity costs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $928 million in operating cash flow primarily driven by extended payment terms. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other operating assets and liabilities utilized $976 million of cash primarily due to the elimination of the deferred tax impacts associated with the Pet Care divestiture. ##TABLE_END Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding certain divestiture impacts (tax payments in the prior year for the Pet Care divestiture) and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  Adjusted free cash flow was $12.1 billion in 2016 , an increase of 4% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows and decrease in capital spending. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the impairment charges and gain on the sale of the Batteries business, was 115% in 2016 . Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014  Adjusted free cash flow was $11.6 billion in 2015 , an increase of 15% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding impairment charges on the Batteries business and the Venezuelan deconsolidation charge, was 102% in 2015 . Investing Cash Flow Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  Net investing activities consumed $5.6 billion in cash in 2016 mainly due to capital spending, divestiture transactions and net purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by sales or maturities of short-term investments. Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014  Net investing activities consumed $2.9 billion in cash in 2015 mainly due to capital spending, net purchases of available-for-sale securities and a reduction in cash due to Venezuela deconsolidation, partially offset by asset sales. Capital Spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.3 billion in 2016 and $3.7 billion in 2015 . Capital spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points to 5.1% in 2016 . Capital spending as a percentage of net sales was 5.3% in 2015 . Acquisitions. Acquisition activity was not material in 2016 or 2015 . Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales in 2016 contributed $432 million in cash, primarily from plant asset sales and other minor brand divestitures. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $4.5 billion in cash in 2015 primarily from the sale of our Pet Care business, the sale of our Chinese battery venture, and other minor brand divestitures. Financing Cash Flow Dividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 3% to $2.66 per share in 2016 . Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $7.4 billion in 2016 and $7.3 billion in 2015 . In April 2016, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.6629 to $0.6695 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This represents a 1% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 60th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We The Procter  Gamble Company 25 have paid a dividend for 126 years, every year since our incorporation in 1890. Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $30.6 billion as of June 30, 2016 and $30.3 billion as of June 30, 2015 . Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $4.0 billion in 2016 and $4.6 billion in 2015 . In addition, the cash infusion of $1.7 billion in the Batteries divestiture was reflected as a purchase of treasury stock. Liquidity At June 30, 2016 , our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $3.0 billion largely due to current assets and current liabilities of the Beauty Brands business held for sale. Excluding current assets and current liabilities of the Beauty Brands business held for sale, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $1.8 billion, largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2016 , $11.0 billion of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is held off-shore by foreign subsidiaries. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. We do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. Of the June 30, 2016 balance of off-shore cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the majority relates to various Western European countries. As of June 30, 2016 , we did not have material cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds. We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. On June 30, 2016 , our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard  Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard  Poor's), all with a stable outlook. We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2020 and November 2016, respectively. The 364-day facility can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. For additional details on debt see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity. 26 The Procter  Gamble Company Contractual Commitments The following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2016 . ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions Total  Less Than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  After 5 Years RECORDED LIABILITIES          Total debt $ 30,221  $ 11,635  $ 3,660  $ 3,467  $ 11,459 Capital leases     Uncertain tax positions (1)        OTHER          Interest payments relating to long-term debt 6,439   1,249   3,527 Operating leases (2) 1,563     Minimum pension funding (3)       Purchase obligations (4) 1,794     TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS $ 40,949  $ 13,915  $ 6,210  $ 5,045  $ 15,779 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  As of June 30, 2016 , the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $1.2 billion, including $343 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2016 , cannot be made. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing. This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position. ##TABLE_END SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions. Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized. We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. Our operating principles are that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities. However, we may have income tax exposure related to the determination of the appropriate transfer prices The Procter  Gamble Company 27 for our various cross-border transactions. We obtain advance rulings with tax authorities to support our positions, where possible, to help manage these exposures. Nonetheless, many of the underlying transactions are subject to audit, resulting in uncertainty until the ultimate audit resolution. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. For additional details on the Company's income taxes, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Employee Benefits We sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits. The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense, since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2016 , the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets was 7.2% and 8.3%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $100 million. Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans of 2.1% and 3.6%, respectively, represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100 basis point change in the pension discount rate would impact annual after-tax defined benefit pension expense by approximately $200 million. A change in the OPEB discount rate of 100 basis points would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $86 million. For additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are primarily based on these same factors. All of our acquired technology and customer-related intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives. 28 The Procter  Gamble Company The costs of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. We test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the book values of each asset to the estimated fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our continuing goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high. While both of these wholly-acquired reporting units have fair value cushions that currently exceed the underlying carrying values, the Shave Care cushion, as well as certain of the related indefinite-lived intangible assets, have been reduced to below 20% due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar that began in recent years and continued during fiscal 2016. As a result, this unit is more susceptible to impairment risk from adverse changes in business operating plans and macroeconomic environment conditions, including any further significant devaluation of major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Any such adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of the business unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. Changes to, or a failure to, achieve these business plans or a further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions could result in a valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing results. New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of June 30, 2016 . OTHER INFORMATION Hedging and Derivative Financial Instruments As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. Except within financing operations, we leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the CorporateManager value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics dataset as of June 30, 2016 . In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics, a reasonable proxy is included. Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term. Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments. The Procter  Gamble Company 29 Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2016 , including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements. Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months. In addition, we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions. Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2016 , we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements. Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures. As of and during the years ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 , we did not have any commodity hedging activity. Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAP Our discussion of financial results includes several \"non-GAAP\" financial measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e. trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. These measures include: Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of the Venezuela deconsolidation, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis, and this measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth: ##TABLE_START Year ended June 30, 2016 Net Sales Growth Foreign Exchange Impact Acquisition/Divestiture Impact* Organic Sales Growth Beauty (9 )% % %  % Grooming (8 )% % % % Health Care (5 )% % % % Fabric  Home Care (7 )% % % % Baby, Feminine  Family Care (9 )% % % (1 )% TOTAL COMPANY (8 )% % % %      Year ended June 30, 2015 Net Sales Growth Foreign Exchange Impact Acquisition/Divestiture Impact* Organic Sales Growth Beauty (6 )% % %  % Grooming (7 )% %  % % Health Care (1 )% %  % % Fabric  Home Care (5 )% % % % Baby, Feminine  Family Care (3 )% %  % % TOTAL COMPANY (5 )% % % % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Acquisition/Divestiture Impact also includes the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and the rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. ##TABLE_END Core EPS. Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Management views these non-GAAP measures as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. The table below provides a reconciliation of revised diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS, including the following reconciling items: ##TABLE_START  Incremental restructuring : While the Company has and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities, beginning in 2012 we began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The charges include only the incremental portion of the restructuring costs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Venezuela deconsolidation charge : For accounting purposes, evolving conditions resulted in a lack of control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Therefore, in ##TABLE_END30 The Procter  Gamble Company accordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation, effective June 30, 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. The charge was incurred to write off our net assets related to Venezuela. ##TABLE_START  Charges for certain European legal matters : Several countries in Europe issued separate complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in prior periods. The Company established Legal Reserves related to these charges. Management does not view these charges as indicative of underlying business results. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Venezuela Balance Sheet Remeasurement  Devaluation Impacts : Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. Prior to deconsolidation, the government enacted episodic changes to currency exchange mechanisms and rates, which resulted in currency remeasurement charges for non-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by our Venezuelan subsidiaries. ##TABLE_END We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30 2015 Diluted net earnings per share - continuing operations $3.49 $2.84 $3.63 Incremental restructuring charges 0.18 0.17 0.11 Venezuela balance sheet devaluation impacts  0.04 0.09 Charges for European legal matters  0.01 0.02 Venezuelan deconsolidation  0.71  Rounding  (0.01)  CORE EPS $3.67 $3.76 $3.85 Core EPS Growth (2 )% (2 )% % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * All reconciling items are presented net of tax. Tax effects are calculated consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction. ##TABLE_END Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending excluding tax payments related to the divestiture of the discontinued Pet business. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions): ##TABLE_START  Operating Cash Flow Capital Spending Free Cash Flow Divestiture impacts* Adjusted Free Cash Flow $ 15,435 $ (3,314 ) $ 12,121 $  $ 12,121 14,608 (3,736 ) 10,872 11,601 13,958 (3,848 ) 10,110  10,110 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Divestiture impacts relate to tax payments for the Pet Care divestiture in fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_END Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding Batteries impairments, the gain on the sale of the Batteries business and Venezuela charges. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand PGs ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions): ##TABLE_START  Net Earnings Gain on Batteries Sale / Impairment  Decon- solidation Charges Net Earnings Excluding Batteries Gain/Impairment  Deconsolid- ation Charges Adjusted Free Cash Flow Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity $ 10,604 $ (72 ) $ 10,532 $ 12,121 % 7,144 4,187 11,331 11,601 % 11,785  11,785 10,100 % ##TABLE_END", "7A": " Item 7A.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of The Procter  Gamble Company (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Strong internal controls is an objective that is reinforced through our Worldwide Business Conduct Manual , which sets forth our commitment to conduct business with integrity, and within both the letter and the spirit of the law. Our people are deeply committed to our Purpose, Values, and Principles, which unite us in doing whats right. Our system of internal controls includes written policies and procedures, segregation of duties, and the careful selection and development of employees. Additional key elements of our internal control structure include our Global Leadership Council, which is actively involved in oversight of the business strategies, initiatives, results and controls, our Disclosure Committee, which is responsible for evaluating disclosure implications of significant business activities and events, our Board of Directors, which provides strong and effective corporate governance, and our Audit Committee, which reviews significant accounting policies, financial reporting and internal control matters. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes a Control Self-Assessment Program that is conducted annually for critical financial reporting areas of the Company and is audited by our Global Internal Audit organization. Management takes the appropriate action to correct any identified control deficiencies. Global Internal Audit also performs financial and compliance audits around the world, provides training, and continuously improves our internal control processes. Because of its inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, may not prevent or detect misstatements due to the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden or that misstatements due to error or fraud may occur that are not detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016 , using criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016 , based on these criteria. Deloitte  Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016 , as stated in their report which is included herein. ##TABLE_START /s/ David S.

Moeller Chief Financial Officer  August 9, 2016 ##TABLE_END32 The Procter  Gamble Company REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Procter  Gamble Company Cincinnati, Ohio We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Shareholders' Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2016 . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries at June 30, 2016 and 2015 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2016 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As discussed in Note 1 and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on July 1, 2015, the Company adopted the new accounting guidance in ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity . We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 9, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP Cincinnati, Ohio  August 9, 2016 ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company 33 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Procter  Gamble Company Cincinnati, Ohio We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

The purpose of this plan is to advance the interests of the Company by giving substantially all employees a stake in the Company's future growth and success and to strengthen the alignment of interests between employees and the Company's shareholders through increased ownership of shares of the Company's stock. The plan has not been submitted to shareholders for approval. Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company's capitalization, the number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 17 million shares. Under the plan's regulations, recipients are granted options to acquire 100 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price equal to the average price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant. These options vest five years after the date of grant and expire ten years following the date of grant. If a recipient leaves the employ of the Company prior to the vesting date for a reason other than disability, retirement or special separation (as defined in the plan), then the award is forfeited. At the time of the first grant following Board approval of the plan, each employee of the Company not eligible for an award under the 1992 Stock Plan was granted options for 100 shares. From the date of this first grant through June 30, 2003, each new employee of the Company has also received options for 100 shares. Following the grant of options on June 30, 2003, the Company suspended this part of the plan. The plan terminated on October 13, 2007. The Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan Shareholders of The Gillette Company approved The Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan on May 20, 2004, and the plan was assumed by the Company upon the merger between The Procter  Gamble Company and The Gillette Company. All options became immediately vested and exercisable on October 1, 2005 as a result of the merger. After the merger, all outstanding options became options to purchase The Procter  Gamble Company 67 shares of The Procter  Gamble Company subject to an exchange ratio of .975 shares of PG stock per share of Gillette stock. Only employees previously employed by The Gillette Company prior to October 1, 2005 are eligible to receive grants under this plan. The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate employees of The Gillette Company and, until the effective date of the merger between The Gillette Company and The Procter  Gamble Company, non-employee members of the Gillette Board of Directors. Under the plan, eligible participants are: (i) granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii) granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii) granted shares of the Company's common stock or restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents). Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company's capitalization and the addition of any shares authorized but not issued or redeemed under The Gillette Company 1971 Stock Option Plan, the number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 19,000,000 shares. Except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights must expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan must be equal to or greater than the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of grant. Any common stock awarded under the plan may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the committee administering the plan may determine. If a recipient of a grant leaves the Company while holding an unexercised option or right: (1) any unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement, special separation (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has waived the termination provisions; and (2) any exercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement, special separation, voluntary resignation that is not for Good Reason (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has waived the termination provisions.

Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the \"Company,\" \"PG,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" as used herein refer to The Procter  Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries. The Procter  Gamble Company is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world's consumers. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having been built from a business founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. Today, our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories. Throughout this Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains these reports at: www.sec.gov. You can also access these reports through links from our website at: www.pginvestor.com. Copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting Wells Fargo, 1100 Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota, MN 55120-4100. Financial Information about Segments As of June 30, 2017 , the Company has five reportable segments under U.S. GAAP: Beauty ; Grooming ; Health Care ; Fabric  Home Care ; and Baby, Feminine  Family Care . Many of the factors necessary for understanding these businesses are similar. Operating margins of the individual businesses vary due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products, the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. Net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets and product categories in which they operate. While none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components within certain reportable segments, such as Appliances (Grooming) and Personal Health Care (Health), are seasonal. Additional information about our reportable segments can be found in the MDA and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Narrative Description of Business Business Model . Our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products, as well as the creation of new products. The markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We utilize our superior marketing and online presence to win with consumers at the \"zero moment of truth\" - when they are searching for information about a brand or product. We work collaboratively with our customers to improve the in-store and online presence of our products and win the \"first moment of truth\" - when a consumer is shopping in the store or online. We must also win the \"second moment of truth\" - when a consumer uses the product, evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and decides whether it was a good value. We believe we must continue to provide new, innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business. Accordingly, marketing and research and product development activities, designed to enable sustained organic growth, continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year. Key Product Categories . Information on key product categories can be found in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Key Customers . Our customers include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 16% of our total sales in 2017 , and 15% in 2016 and 2015 . No other customer represents more than 10% of our total sales. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 35% of our total sales in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . The nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government. We believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete. Sources and Availability of Materials . Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from others, some of which are single-source suppliers. We produce certain raw materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing process and in the transportation of input materials and of finished product to customers. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers. The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, none of which is material to our business taken as a whole. Trademarks and Patents . We own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks, which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. All major trademarks in each business are registered. 2 The Procter  Gamble Company In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses. Competitive Condition . The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. We support our products with advertising, promotions and other marketing vehicles to build awareness and trial of our brands and products in conjunction with an extensive sales force. We believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products. Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important differentiating factors. Research and Development Expenditures . Research and development (RD) expenditures enable us to develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of our consumers. Research and development expenses were $1.9 billion in 2017 and 2016 and $2.0 billion in 2015 (reported in Net earnings from continuing operations). Expenditures for Environmental Compliance .

Risk Factors. We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-K, quarterly and annual reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. The following discussion of risk factors identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with the MDA and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes incorporated in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. The Procter  Gamble Company 3 Our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility. We are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world. We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our operations outside the U.S. generate a significant portion of our net revenue. Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in U.S. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition. Moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries could adversely affect our results. See also the Results of Operations and Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity sections of the MDA and Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls or restrictions, including Nigeria and Ukraine. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business. Additionally, our business, operations or employees may be adversely affected by political volatility, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval, broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments, particularly in emerging markets. Uncertain global economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, which could adversely impact our business. Our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic disruptions, such as: a slow-down in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers; a significant shift in government policies; or the inability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. Additionally, economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third party partners to suffer financial difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles. In addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient income and cash flow, it could affect the Companys ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments. Disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit. A disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. Disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results. Our ability to meet our customers needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. The loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity in our internal information and data systems, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials, significant changes in trade policy, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare. Therefore, our business results are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our financial results. Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits . We are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. Achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. The success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. We must also successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors. Failure to continually innovate, improve and 4 The Procter  Gamble Company respond to competitive moves and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels. The consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms. In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce, could negatively impact our results. A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of our products or experience a significant business disruption. If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. The Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer. Our Company also devotes significant time and resources to programs that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. If these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, the Company's reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. Due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and external business partners, for certain functions. If we are unable to effectively manage our third party relationships and the agreements under which our third party partners operate, our financial results could suffer. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, hardware, processes, and/or associated sites owned or operated by the Company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. We rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems, networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. The various uses of these IT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: ##TABLE_START  ordering and managing materials from suppliers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  converting materials to finished products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  shipping products to customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  marketing and selling products to consumers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  collecting, transferring, storing and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company 5 ##TABLE_START  collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  providing data security; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  handling other processes necessary to manage our business. ##TABLE_END Numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our IT systems, networks and services, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations. As cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally, the Company is continually increasing its attention to these threats. We continue to assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments seeking to address them, including monitoring of networks and systems, increasing information security skills, deploying employee security training, and updating security policies for the Company and its third-party providers. However, because the techniques used in cyber attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or mitigating harms after such an attack. Our IT databases and systems and our third-party providers databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing and other cyber-attacks. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks; however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party providers will prevent breaches, operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our third-party providers databases or systems. If the IT systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss, significant unavailability of key operations or disclosure of our sensitive business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security incidents, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. The costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results. Changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results. Changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, the United Kingdoms decision to leave the European Union has created uncertainty regarding, among other things, the U.K.'s future legal and economic framework and how the U.K. will interact with other countries, including with respect to the free movement of goods, services and people. In addition, results of elections, referendums or other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured, sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, taxes, the movement of goods, services and people between countries and other matters. The potential implications of such uncertainty, which include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations and market contraction, could adversely affect the Companys business and financial results. We must successfully manage compliance with laws and regulations, as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the U.S. and abroad. Our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across all of the countries in which we do business, including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property, product liability, marketing, antitrust, privacy, environmental, employment, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, tax, accounting and financial reporting or other matters. Rapidly changing laws, regulations and related interpretations, as well as increased enforcement actions, create challenges for the Company, including our compliance and ethics programs, and may alter the environment in which we do business, which could adversely impact our financial results. If we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. Failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. Furthermore, if pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results. The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Because the U.S. maintains a worldwide corporate tax system, the foreign and U.S. tax systems are somewhat interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the U.S. is not taxed in the U.S., provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. If those same foreign earnings are instead repatriated to the U.S., additional residual U.S. taxation will likely occur, due to the U.S.s worldwide tax system and higher U.S. corporate tax rate. The U.S. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly change the corporate tax rate and the U.S. international tax rules. Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each countrys jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving  as a result of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting reporting requirements (BEPS\") recommended by the G8, G20 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\"OECD\"). As these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be 6 The Procter  Gamble Company cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results. Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities. While we believe our tax positions will be sustained, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 Beauty Brands transaction with Coty, may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements, which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results. We must successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands. Our financial results could also be impacted in the event of acquisitions or joint venture activities if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets. Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change. Our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings, including staffing adjustments as well as employee departures. Failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings, while continuing to invest in business growth, could adversely impact our financial results. Additionally, successfully executing management transitions at leadership levels of the Company and retention of key employees is critical to our business success. We are generally a build-from-within company and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense, as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Management's Discussion and Analysis Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including, without limitation, in the following sections: Management's Discussion and Analysis and Risk Factors. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believe, project, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, strategy, future, opportunity, plan, may, should, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled \"Economic Conditions and Uncertainties\" and the section titled Risk Factors (Item 1A of this Form 10-K). Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MDA) is to provide an understanding of Procter  Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MDA is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The MDA is organized in the following sections: ##TABLE_START  Overview ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Summary of 2017 Results ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Economic Conditions and Uncertainties ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Results of Operations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Segment Results ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Information ##TABLE_END Throughout the MDA we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of the Venezuela deconsolidation, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and certain divestiture impacts. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of the MDA provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MDA are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category. OVERVIEW PG is a global leader in fast-moving consumer goods, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products, as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. 12 The Procter  Gamble Company ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE Our organizational structure is comprised of Global Business Units (GBUs), Selling and Market Operations (SMOs), Global Business Services (GBS) and Corporate Functions (CF). Global Business Units Our GBUs are organized into ten product categories. Under U.S. GAAP, the GBUs underlying the ten product categories are aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty ; Grooming ; Health Care ; Fabric  Home Care ; and Baby, Feminine  Family Care . The GBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the ten product categories and brand composition within each segment. ##TABLE_START Reportable Segments % of Net Sales (1) % of Net Earnings (1) Product Categories (Sub-Categories) Major Brands Beauty 18% 19% Hair Care ( Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments ) Head  Shoulders, Pantene, Rejoice Skin and Personal Care ( Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care ) Olay, Old Spice, Safeguard, SK-II Grooming 10% 16% Grooming  (2) (Shave Care - Female Blades  Razors, Male Blades  Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care; Appliances) Braun, Fusion, Gillette, Mach3, Prestobarba, Venus Health Care 12% 13% Oral Care ( Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care ) Crest, Oral-B Personal Health Care ( Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care ) Prilosec, Vicks Fabric  Home Care 32% 27% Fabric Care ( Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents ) Ariel, Downy, Gain, Tide Home Care ( Air Care, Dish Care, PG Professional, Surface Care ) Cascade, Dawn, Febreze, Mr. Clean, Swiffer Baby, Feminine  Family Care 28% 25% Baby Care ( Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants ) Luvs, Pampers Feminine Care ( Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care ) Always, Tampax Family Care ( Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper ) Bounty, Charmin ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Percent of Net sales and Net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2017 (excluding results held in Corporate). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The Grooming product category is comprised of the Shave Care and Appliances GBUs.   ##TABLE_END Recent Developments: During fiscal 2017, the Company completed the previously announced plan to significantly streamline our product portfolio by divesting, discontinuing or consolidating about 100 non-strategic brands. The resulting portfolio of about 65 key brands are in 10 category-based businesses where PG has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies. During fiscal 2017, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories, which included 43 of the Company's beauty brands (\"Beauty Brands\"), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and the fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. The Beauty Brands had historically been part of the Companys Beauty reportable segment. The results of the Beauty Brands are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Additionally, the Beauty Brands balance sheet positions as of June 30, 2016 are presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the final transaction of $5.3 billion ($1.95 per share), net of transaction and related costs. During fiscal 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business. The Batteries business had historically been part of the Companys Fabric  Home Care reportable segment. The results of the Batteries business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. During fiscal 2015, the Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care business. The gain on the transaction was not material. The results of the Pet Care business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Refer to Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on each of these divestiture transactions. While our ongoing business model may include a certain level of acquisition and divestiture activity, with the aforementioned transactions and other recent minor brand divestitures, the Company has completed the strategic portfolio reshaping program. The Procter  Gamble Company 13 As of June 30, 2015, the Company deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. This change resulted in a fiscal 2015 one-time after-tax charge of $2.1 billion ($0.71 per share). Beginning in fiscal 2016, our financial results only include sales of finished goods to our Venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent we receive cash payments from Venezuela (expected to be largely through the DIPRO and DICOM exchange market). Accordingly, we no longer include the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries' operations in reporting periods following fiscal 2015 (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and additional discussion in the MDA under \"Venezuela Impacts\" in Results of Operations). Beauty : We are a global market leader in the beauty category. Most of the beauty markets in which we compete are highly fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. We compete in skin and personal care and in hair care. In skin and personal care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to personal cleansing to skin care, such as our Olay brand, which is one of the top facial skin care brands in the world with nearly 6% global market share. We are the global market leader in the retail hair care market with over 20% global market share primarily behind our Pantene and Head  Shoulders brands. Grooming : We compete in Shave Care and Appliances. In Shave Care, we are the global market leader in the blades and razors market. Our global blades and razors market share is nearly 65%, primarily behind the Gillette franchise including our Fusion, Mach3, Prestobarba and Venus brands. Our appliances, such as electric razors and epilators, are sold under the Braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. We hold nearly 25% of the male shavers market and over 50% of the female epilators market. Health Care : We compete in oral care and personal health care. In oral care, there are several global competitors in the market and we have the number two market share position with nearly 20% global market share behind our Oral-B and Crest brands. In personal health care, we are a top ten competitor in a large, highly fragmented industry, primarily behind respiratory treatments (Vicks brand), non-prescription heartburn medications (Prilosec OTC brand) and digestive wellness products (Metamucil, Pepto Bismol, and Align brands). Nearly all of our sales outside the U.S. in personal health care are generated through the PGT Healthcare partnership with Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Fabric  Home Care : This segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products including laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; and home care products including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners. In fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two market share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader with over 25% global market share, primarily behind our Tide, Ariel and Downy brands. Our global home care market share is over 20% across the categories in which we compete. Baby, Feminine  Family Care : In baby care, we are the global market leader and compete mainly in diapers, pants and baby wipes with over 25% global market share. We are the number one or number two baby care competitor in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind Pampers, the Company's largest brand, with annual net sales of more than $8 billion. We are the global market leader in the feminine care category with over 25% global market share, primarily behind Always. We also compete in the adult incontinence category in certain markets, achieving over 10% market share in the markets where we compete. Our family care business is predominantly a North American business comprised largely of the Bounty paper towel and Charmin toilet paper brands. U.S. market shares are over 40% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin. Selling and Market Operations Our SMOs are responsible for developing and executing go-to-market plans at the local level. The SMOs include dedicated retail customer, trade channel and country-specific teams. Our SMOs are organized under six regions comprised of North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Greater China and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA). Throughout the MDA, we reference business results in developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan, and developing markets which are all other markets not included in developed. Corporate Functions CF provides company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources and legal, as well as other centralized functional support. Global Business Services GBS provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the GBUs, the SMOs and Corporate Functions to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment. STRATEGIC FOCUS PG aspires to serve the worlds consumers better than our best competitors in every category and in every country in which we compete, and, as a result, deliver total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. Delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top-line growth, bottom-line growth and strong cash generation. Our strategic choices are focused on winning with consumers. The consumers who purchase and use our products are at the center of everything we do. We increase the number of users - and the usage - of our brands when we win at the zero, first and second moments of truth: when consumers research our categories and brands, purchase them in a store or online and use them in their homes. Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires innovation. Innovation has always been, and continues to be, PGs lifeblood. Innovation requires 14 The Procter  Gamble Company consumer insights and technology advancements that lead to product improvements, improved marketing and merchandising programs and game-changing inventions that create new brands and categories. Productivity improvement is critical to delivering our balanced top-line growth, bottom-line growth and value creation objectives. Productivity improvement and sales growth reinforce and fuel each other. We are driving productivity improvement across all elements of cost, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional expenses and non-manufacturing overhead. Productivity improvements and cost savings are being reinvested in product and packaging improvements, brand awareness-building advertising and trial-building sampling programs, increased sales coverage and RD programs. We are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs. The Company has undertaken an effort to focus and strengthen its business portfolio to compete in categories and with brands that are structurally attractive and that play to PG's strengths. The ongoing portfolio of businesses consists of 10 product categories. These are categories where PG has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies. We believe these strategies are right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term annual financial targets will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive peer group: ##TABLE_START  Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Core EPS growth of mid-to-high single digits; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater. ##TABLE_END In periods with significant macroeconomic pressures, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to investing so as not to sacrifice the long-term health of our businesses to meet short-term objectives in any given year.

Volume increased low single digits in Grooming, Health Care, Fabric  Home Care and Baby, Feminine  Family Care. Volume decreased low single digits in Beauty. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net earnings from continuing operations increased $167 million or 2% in fiscal 2017, driven by higher operating income and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by an increase in other non-operating expense. Foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings from continuing operations by approximately $420 million or 4%. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $4.6 billion primarily due to the net impact of a gain on the sale of our Beauty business in fiscal 2017, partially offset by ##TABLE_ENDthe base period results, which included the net earnings of the Batteries and Beauty Brands businesses prior to divestiture, a gain on the sale of the Batteries business and impairment charges on the Batteries business prior to divestiture. ##TABLE_START  Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble were $15.3 billion , an increase of $4.8 billion or 46% versus the prior year primarily due to the aforementioned increases in net earnings from both continuing and from discontinued operations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted net earnings per share increased 51% to $5.59 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 6% to $3.69 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Core EPS increased 7% to $3.92 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash flow from operating activities was $12.8 billion . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adjusted free cash flow was $9.8 billion . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 94% . ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company 15 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are \"forward-looking statements\" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. Global Economic Conditions.  Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest in the Middle East and Central  Eastern Europe, further economic instability in the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American markets, further economic slowdowns in Japan and China and changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings. Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings. Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. As discussed later in this MDA, we initiated certain non-manufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvements projects in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2017, we announced an additional multi-year cost reduction program. These programs are resulting in significant enrollment and other savings. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings. Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Over the past four years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, and the United Kingdom have had, and could continue to have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Increased pricing in response to these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales. Government Policies. Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies. For example, the U.S. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly impact the corporate tax rate and change the U.S. tax treatment of international earnings. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt and currency exposure in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria and Ukraine. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings. For example, during fiscal 2015, the Company deconsolidated its Venezuelan subsidiaries due to evolving conditions that resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar and restricted our ability to pay dividends and satisfy certain other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SGA), other non-operating items and income taxes. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives and other activities by competitors), geographic expansion and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the U.S. Most of our cost of products sold and SGA are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs 16 The Procter  Gamble Company that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary drivers of SGA are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. Overhead costs are also variable in nature, but on a relative basis, less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth. Accordingly, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs. The Company is in the midst of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. The plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. Net Sales Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  Net sales were unchanged at $65.1 billion in 2017 on a 1% increase in unit volume versus the prior year period. Volume increased low single digits in Grooming, Health Care, Fabric  Home Care and Baby, Feminine  Family Care. Volume decreased low single digits in Beauty. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and was unchanged in developing regions. Organic volume increased low single digits in both developed and developing markets. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Neither pricing nor mix had any net impact on net sales for the year. Organic sales grew 2% driven by a 2% increase in organic volume. Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  Net sales decreased 8% to $65.3 billion in 2016 on a 3% decrease in unit volume versus the prior year period. Volume decreased low single digits in Grooming, Health Care, Fabric  Home Care and Baby, Feminine  Family Care and decreased mid-single digits in Beauty. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and declined high single digits in developing regions, in part due to increased pricing to address foreign exchange devaluations and due to the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. Organic volume declined mid-single digits in developing markets. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 6%, while higher pricing drove a 1% favorable impact on net sales. Organic volume decreased 1% and organic sales grew 1% driven by higher pricing.

Gross margin increased primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  a 230 basis-point positive impact from total manufacturing cost savings (210 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments), ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 20 basis-point benefit from lower restructuring charges and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 10 basis-point benefit from positive scale impacts due to higher volume. ##TABLE_END These impacts were partially offset by: ##TABLE_START  a 90 basis-point decrease from unfavorable product mix between segments (caused primarily by the lower relative proportion of sales in Grooming, which has higher than company-average gross margins) and within segments (due to disproportionate growth of lower margin products, forms and package sizes in certain businesses), ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 40 basis-point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a combined 70 basis-point impact due to higher commodities and other costs. ##TABLE_END Total SGA decreased 2% to $18.6 billion as increased overhead and advertising spending were more than offset by a reduction in other operating expenses, primarily due to a reduction in net foreign exchange transactional costs and gains on real estate sales. SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points to 28.5% as a result of the decline in other operating expenses. ##TABLE_START  Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points due to an increase in marketing activities, partially offset by productivity savings. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points, primarily driven by wage inflation and increased sales personnel in certain businesses, partially offset by 20 basis points of productivity savings. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other operating expenses as a percent of net sales declined 80 basis points. Lower foreign exchange transactional charges reduced SGA as a percentage of net sales by ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company 17 approximately 20 basis points. The balance of the reduction is primarily driven by gains on sales of real estate. Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  Gross margin increased 200 basis points to 49.6% of net sales in 2016. Gross margin increased primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  a 210 basis-point positive impact from manufacturing cost savings, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 110 basis-point benefit from lower commodity costs and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 70 basis-point benefit of higher pricing. ##TABLE_END These impacts were partially offset by: ##TABLE_START  a 70 basis-point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 70 basis-point decrease due to unfavorable product mix caused by the disproportionate decline of higher margin segments like Beauty and by product form mix within the segments, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 20 basis-point decrease from negative scale impacts due to lower volume and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 20 basis-point decline due to incremental restructuring activity. ##TABLE_END Total SGA decreased 8% to $18.9 billion in 2016 primarily due to reduced overhead spending and a decrease in foreign exchange transaction charges. SGA as a percentage of net sales declined 10 basis points to 29.0%, as negative scale impacts of lower net sales and inflationary impacts were more than offset by cost savings efforts, mainly in overhead spending, and lower foreign exchange transactional charges. ##TABLE_START  Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 90 basis points due to the negative scale impacts from reduced sales. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points, as 90 basis points of productivity savings were partially offset by wage inflation, increased sales personnel in certain businesses and investments in research and development. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Lower foreign exchange transactional charges reduced SGA as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points. A pre-deconsolidation balance sheet remeasurement charge in Venezuela in fiscal year 2015 drove 20 basis points of this decline. The balance of the reduction relates to lower transactional charges from revaluing receivables and payables from transactions denominated in a currency other than a local entitys functional currency. ##TABLE_END In addition to the gross margin expansion and decrease in SGA as a percent of net sales discussed above, operating margin also increased by 290 basis points in 2016 due to a $2.0 billion charge in 2015 related to the deconsolidation of the Company's Venezuelan subsidiaries. Non-Operating Items Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 ##TABLE_START  Interest expense was $465 million in 2017 , a decrease of $114 million versus the prior year due to a decrease in weighted average interest rates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interest income was $171 million in 2017 , comparable to 2016. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other non-operating income/(expense), which consists primarily of divestiture gains, investment income, and other non-operating items, was a net expense of $404 million in 2017 versus a net income of $325 million in 2016, a $729 million year-over-year decrease. This change is due to a $543 million current-year charge related to early extinguishment of long-term debt and a reduction in gains on minor brand divestitures. In 2017 , we had approximately $110 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Hipoglos (a baby care brand sold primarily in Brazil) and other minor brands. The prior year divestiture activities included approximately $300 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Escudo and certain hair care brands in Europe and IMEA. ##TABLE_END Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 ##TABLE_START  Interest expense was $579 million in 2016, a decrease of $47 million versus the prior year due to lower average debt balances. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interest income was $182 million in 2016, an increase of $33 million versus the prior year primarily due to increasing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other non-operating income, which primarily includes divestiture gains and investment income, decreased $115 million to $325 million in 2016, due primarily to lower gains on minor brand divestitures. In 2016, we had approximately $300 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Escudo and certain hair care brands in Europe and IMEA. The prior year acquisition and divestiture activities included approximately $450 million in divestiture gains, including Zest, Camay, Fekkai and Wash  Go hair care brands and Vaposteam. ##TABLE_END Income Taxes Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 190 basis points to 23.1% . The rate declined due to: ##TABLE_START  a 130 basis-points impact from excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments due to the adoption of FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting in 2017, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 150 basis-point benefit from discrete impacts related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to approximately 205 basis points in the current year versus 55 basis points in the prior year), ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 50 basis-point benefit from the tax impact of the early extinguishment of long-term debt, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 130 basis-point benefit from the prior year establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards. ##TABLE_END These benefits were partially offset by a 230 basis-point increase from unfavorable geographic mix, primarily due to a greater proportion of total income taxed in the U.S. and a 40 basis-point increase due to the impact of minor brand divestitures. 18 The Procter  Gamble Company Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 30 basis points to 25.0% in 2016 mainly due to: ##TABLE_START  a 260 basis-point negative impact from the unfavorable geographic mix of earnings, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 130 basis-point impact in 2016 from the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and the impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to 55 basis points in 2016 versus 85 basis points in 2015). ##TABLE_END These benefits were partially offset by a 400 basis point decrease related to the non-deductibility of the Venezuelan deconsolidation charge in 2015. Net Earnings Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  Net earnings from continuing operations increased $167 million , or 2% , to $10.2 billion . Operating income improved $514 million , or 4% , due to improved gross margin and reduced SGA costs. Net earnings also benefitted from a lower tax rate in 2017. These benefits were partially offset by the increase in net non-operating expenses, discussed above. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $420 million in 2017 due to weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar, including those in Argentina, Nigeria, Egypt and the United Kingdom. This impact includes both transactional charges as discussed above in Operating Costs and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $4.6 billion in 2017 to $5.2 billion . This change was driven by the $5.3 billion gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands in the current year, partially offset by the impact of the base period results, which included the net earnings of the Batteries and Beauty Brands businesses prior to divestiture, a gain on the sale of the Batteries business and impairment charges on the Batteries business prior to divestiture (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble increased $4.8 billion , or 46% , to $15.3 billion . Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.20 , or 6% , to $3.69 due to the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and a reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding following the shares tendered in the sale of the Beauty Brands to Coty (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), along with ongoing share repurchases. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations were $1.90 . This was an increase of $1.70 per share versus the prior year primarily resulting from the gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands. Diluted net earnings per share increased $1.90 , or 51% , to $5.59 . Core EPS increased 7% to $3.92 . Core EPS in fiscal year 2017 represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the charge related to early extinguishment of long-term debt and incremental restructuring charges related to our productivity and cost savings plan. The increase was driven by operating margin expansion, lower effective tax rate and the reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding discussed above. Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  Net earnings from continuing operations increased $1.7 billion, or 21%, to $10.0 billion in 2016 primarily due to the base period charge of $2.1 billion after-tax related to the deconsolidation of Venezuelan subsidiaries. Earnings also declined due to the impact of the decline in net sales in fiscal 2016, partially offset by improved gross margin and the reduction in SGA. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by about $880 million in 2016 due to weakening of certain key currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Russia. This impact includes both transactional charges as discussed above in Operating Costs and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings from discontinued operations improved $1.7 billion in 2016 to $577 million. Batteries drove a $2.1 billion improvement due primarily to a $1.8 billion reduction in after-tax impairment charges in the Batteries business ($350 million in 2016 compared to $2.1 billion in 2015) and a $422 million after-tax gain in 2016 from the sale of the Batteries business. This was partially offset by a decrease in the earnings of the Beauty Brands in 2016 (see Notes 4 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble increased $3.5 billion, or 49% to $10.5 billion. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.65, or 23%, to $3.49 in 2016 due to the increase in net earnings and a decline in the average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.20 primarily resulting from the gain on the sale of the Batteries business. This was an improvement of $0.60 per share versus the prior year. Diluted net earnings per share increased $1.25, or 51%, to $3.69. Core EPS decreased 2% to $3.67 in 2016. Core EPS in fiscal year 2016 represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges for certain European legal matters and incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan. The decline was driven by reduced net sales and foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by gross margin expansion. Venezuela Impacts There are a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions in Venezuela, which have evolved over time and may continue to evolve in the future. These evolving conditions resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar and restricted our Venezuelan operations ability to pay dividends or pay for certain raw and package materials, finished goods and services denominated in U.S. dollars. For accounting purposes, this resulted in a lack of control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Therefore, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation, effective The Procter  Gamble Company 19 June 30, 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. This resulted in a write-off of all of the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries, along with Venezuela related assets held by other subsidiaries. Beginning in fiscal 2016, our financial results only include sales of finished goods to our Venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent we receive payments from Venezuela. Accordingly, we no longer include the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries operations in our financial results. SEGMENT RESULTS Segment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs such as interest expense, investing activities and certain restructuring and asset impairment costs. These costs are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, as described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments. Eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our consolidated effective tax rate are included in Corporate. All references to net earnings throughout the discussion of segment results refer to net earnings from continuing operations. ##TABLE_START Net Sales Change Drivers 2017 vs. 2016 (1)  Volume with Acquisitions  Divestitures  Volume Excluding Acquisitions  Divestitures  Foreign Exchange  Price  Mix  Other (2)  Net Sales Growth Beauty (2 )%  %  (2 )%  %  %  %   % Grooming %  %  (2 )%  (1 )%  (2 )%   %  (3 )% Health Care %  %  (2 )%   %  %   %  % Fabric  Home Care %  %  (2 )%   %  %   %   % Baby, Feminine  Family Care %  %  (2 )%  (1 )%   %   %  (1 )% TOTAL COMPANY %  %  (2 )%   %   %  %   % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net Sales Change Drivers 2016 vs. 2015 (1)  Volume with Acquisitions  Divestitures  Volume Excluding Acquisitions  Divestitures  Foreign Exchange  Price  Mix  Other (2)  Net Sales Growth Beauty (5 )%  (2 )%  (6 )%  %   %   %  (9 )% Grooming (2 )%  (2 )%  (9 )%  %  (2 )%   %  (8 )% Health Care (2 )%  (2 )%  (6 )%  %  %   %  (5 )% Fabric  Home Care (1 )%  %  (6 )%   %   %   %  (7 )% Baby, Feminine  Family Care (3 )%  (2 )%  (6 )%   %   %   %  (9 )% TOTAL COMPANY (3 )%  (1 )%  (6 )%  %   %   %  (8 )% ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. ##TABLE_END BEAUTY ##TABLE_START ($ millions)  Change vs. 2016   Change vs. 2015 Volume N/A  (2)%  N/A  (5)% Net sales $11,429  %  $11,477  (9)% Net earnings $1,914  (3)%  $1,975  (9)% % of net sales 16.7%  (50) bps  17.2%  (10) bps ##TABLE_ENDFiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Beauty net sales were unchanged at  $11.4 billion  in 2017 on  a 2% decrease in unit volume .

SGA as a percentage of net sales increased due to increased overhead spending including investments in sales resources and incremental marketing activity. Gross margin decreased slightly as the benefits from productivity savings and higher pricing were more than offset by higher commodity costs and unfavorable mix impacts (driven by Hair Care from an increase in the proportion of lower margin forms and categories, and unfavorable geographic mix, which more than offset benefit from Skin and Personal Care, driven by the growth of SK-II).  Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  Beauty net sales decreased 9% to $11.5 billion in fiscal 2016 on a 5% decrease in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 6%.

Organic volume declined mid-single digits in developing regions primarily due to increased pricing and competitive activity. Global market share of the skin and personal care category decreased nearly a point. ##TABLE_END Net earnings decreased 9% to $2.0 billion in 2016 primarily due to the reduction in net sales, along with a 10 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due to an increase in SGA as a percentage of net sales, largely offset by gross margin expansion. Gross margin improved due to productivity savings, increased pricing and lower commodity costs, partially offset by negative mix. SGA as a percentage of net sales increased as lower marketing and overhead spending from the Company's focus on efficiencies was more than offset by the negative scale impacts from the reduction in sales.

Net earnings margin increased 40 basis points due to a decrease in SGA as a percent of net sales and improved gross margin. SGA as a percent of net sales decreased due to a gain on the sale of real estate, partially offset by increased overhead spending. Gross margin increased as the benefits of productivity efforts were only partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, reduced pricing and negative mix driven by growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower than in developed regions, in part due to a higher relative proportion of disposable razors in those markets. The Procter  Gamble Company 21 Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Grooming net sales decreased 8% to $6.8 billion in 2016 on a 2% decrease in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 9%. Price increases in Shave Care contributed 5% to net sales.

Global market share of the home care category was down slightly. ##TABLE_END Net earnings increased 5% to $2.8 billion in 2016 behind a 160 basis-point increase in net earnings margin, which more than offset the reduction in net sales. Net earnings margin increased due to gross margin expansion, partially offset by increased SGA as a percentage of net sales. Increased gross margin was driven by manufacturing cost savings and lower commodity costs. SGA as a percentage of net sales increased due to an increase in marketing spending and the negative scale impacts from the reduction in net sales.

These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item is income taxes to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Corporate net sales increased 20%, or $83 million, to $505 million in 2017 primarily due to an increase in the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings from continuing operations improved by approximately $421 million in 2017, primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  lower restructuring charges in 2017 compared to the prior year, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a gain on the sale of real estate in the current fiscal year, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  lower foreign exchange transactional charges, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a reduction in the proportion of corporate overhead spending not allocated to the segments, consisting in part of reduced stranded overheads following divestitures, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  current year tax benefits resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard on the tax impacts of share-based payments to employees (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). ##TABLE_END These benefits were partially offset by a $345 million after-tax charge on the early extinguishment of long-term debt in fiscal 2017 and lower gains from minor brand divestitures compared to 2016. Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Corporate net sales decreased $44 million in 2016 to $422 million. Corporate net earnings from continuing operations improved by approximately $2.2 billion in 2016, primarily due to the $2.1 billion Venezuela deconsolidation charge in the prior fiscal year and lower foreign currency transactional charges. Additional discussion of these items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section. Productivity and Cost Savings Plan In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing 24 The Procter  Gamble Company and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. In 2016 the Company communicated additional multi-year productivity and cost savings targets. In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of the productivity and cost savings targets. As part of the original plan, the Company incurred approximately $5.6 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a six-year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017 ). Savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. Through 2017 , these costs and other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions delivered approximately $2.9 billion in annual before-tax gross savings. The additional productivity and cost savings plan will further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. As part of this plan, the Company expects to incur approximately $1.2 billion in total before-tax restructuring costs in fiscal 2018 and 2019. This program is expected to result in meaningful non-manufacturing enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Restructuring accruals of $277 million as of June 30, 2017 are classified as current liabilities. During fiscal 2017 , 48% of the restructuring charges incurred either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program and to the Operating Costs section of the MDA for more information about the total benefit to operating margins from our total savings efforts. CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations. Operating Cash Flow Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  Operating cash flow was $12.8 billion in 2017 , a 17% decrease from the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes, loss/(gain) on sale of assets and impairment charges) and the loss on early extinguishment of debt generated $13.0 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $281 million of operating cash flow. ##TABLE_START  An increase in accounts receivable used $322 million of cash due to higher relative sales late in the period as compared to the prior period, partially offset by collection of approximately $150 million of retained receivables from the Beauty Brands business. In addition, the number of days sales outstanding increased 1 day due in part to foreign exchange impacts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Lower inventory generated $71 million of cash mainly due to supply chain optimizations, partially offset by increases to support business growth and increased commodity costs. Inventory days on hand decreased approximately 1 day primarily due to supply chain optimizations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities decreased, using $149 million in operating cash flow. This was caused by reduced accruals from lower fourth quarter marketing and overhead activities as compared to the base period, as well as the payment of approximately $595 million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to the divestiture of the Beauty Brands business, including liabilities retained by the Company pursuant to the terms of the agreement. These impacts were partially offset by approximately $700 million related to extended payment terms with our suppliers. These factors, along with the impact of foreign exchange, drove a 4 day increase in days payable outstanding. Although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics, we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers could decline slightly over the next fiscal year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other operating assets and liabilities used $43 million of cash. ##TABLE_END Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  Operating cash flow was $15.4 billion in 2016 , a 6% increase from the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes, loss/(gain) on sale of assets and impairment charges) generated $13.6 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow. ##TABLE_START  Reduced accounts receivable generated $35 million of cash due to improved collection results partially offset by sales mix. The number of days sales outstanding increased 1 day due to foreign exchange impacts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Lower inventory generated $116 million of cash mainly due to supply chain optimizations and lower commodity costs. Inventory days on hand increased 4 days primarily due to foreign exchange impacts. ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company 25 ##TABLE_START  Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $1.3 billion in operating cash flow, of which approximately $0.8 billion was driven by extended payment terms with our suppliers. The balance was primarily driven by an increase in fourth quarter marketing activity versus the prior year. These items, along with the impact of foreign exchange, drove a 24 day increase in days payable outstanding. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other operating assets and liabilities generated $204 million of cash. ##TABLE_END Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding tax payments related to certain divestitures and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  Adjusted free cash flow was $9.8 billion in 2017 , a decrease of 19% versus the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in operating cash flows. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, excluding the loss on debt extinguishment and impacts of the sale of the Beauty Brands, was 94% in 2017 . Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  Adjusted free cash flow was $12.1 billion in 2016 , an increase of 4% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows and decrease in capital spending. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the impairment charges and gain on the sale of the Batteries business, was 115% in 2016 . Investing Cash Flow Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  Net investing activities consumed $5.7 billion in cash in 2017 mainly due to capital spending and purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales, transactions related to the close of the Beauty Brands divestiture and sales and maturities of short-term investments. Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  Net investing activities consumed $5.6 billion in cash in 2016 mainly due to capital spending, divestiture transactions and purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by sales and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.4 billion in 2017 and $3.3 billion in 2016 . Capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 5.2% in 2017 . Capital spending as a percentage of net sales was 5.1% in 2016 . Acquisitions. Acquisition activity was not material in 2017 or 2016 . Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales in 2017 contributed $571 million in cash, primarily from real estate sales and other minor brand divestitures. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $432 million in cash in 2016 primarily from plant asset sales and other minor brand divestitures. In fiscal 2016, the Company invested $1.0 billion of cash, received from the pre-Beauty Brands divestiture issuance of transaction-related debt, in restricted cash. In fiscal 2017, the Company invested an additional $874 million of cash, received from the issuance of debt, in restricted cash. At the closing of the Beauty Brands transaction, $1.9 billion of restricted cash was released and returned to cash and cash equivalents and $475 million of cash was transferred to the discontinued Beauty Brands business. Financing Cash Flow Dividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 1.5% to $2.70 per share in 2017 . Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $7.2 billion in 2017 and $7.4 billion in 2016 . In April 2017, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.6695 to $0.6896 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This represents a 3% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 61st consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend for 127 years, every year since our incorporation in 1890. Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $31.6 billion as of June 30, 2017 and $30.6 billion as of June 30, 2016 . Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $5.2 billion in 2017 and $4.0 billion in 2016 . In addition, the cash infusion of $1.7 billion in the Batteries divestiture was reflected as a purchase of treasury stock in 2016 . Liquidity At June 30, 2017 , our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $3.7 billion largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2017 , $15.0 billion of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is held off-shore by foreign subsidiaries. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation to the U.S. Under current law, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. Of the June 30, 2017 balance of off-shore cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the majority relates to various Western European countries. As of June 30, 2017 , we did not have material cash, cash equivalents and 26 The Procter  Gamble Company marketable securities balances in any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds. We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. On June 30, 2017 , our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard  Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard  Poor's), all with a stable outlook. We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2021 and November 2017, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. For additional details on debt see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity. Contractual Commitments The following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2017 . ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions Total  Less Than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  After 5 Years RECORDED LIABILITIES          Total debt $ 31,455  $ 13,543  $ 3,101  $ 4,236  $ 10,575 Capital leases     Uncertain tax positions (1)        OTHER          Interest payments relating to long-term debt 5,220   1,014   2,725 Operating leases (2) 1,493     Minimum pension funding (3)       Purchase obligations (4) 1,607     TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS $ 40,222  $ 15,395  $ 5,293  $ 5,656  $ 13,878 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  As of June 30, 2017 , the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $585 million, including $120 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2017 , cannot be made. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2020 are not currently determinable. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represents minimum commitments under take-or-pay agreements with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. Such amounts also include arrangements with suppliers that qualify as embedded operating leases. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position. ##TABLE_END SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting The Procter  Gamble Company 27 policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions. Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized. We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. A core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities. However, because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border transactions. We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty. We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. For additional details on the Company's income taxes, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Employee Benefits We sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits. The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2017 , the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets was 6.9% and 8.3%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $100 million. Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 2.4% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 1.0% change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $200 million. The average discount rate on the OPEB plan of 3.9% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where a majority of the plan participants receive benefits. A 1.0% change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $70 million. For additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 28 The Procter  Gamble Company Goodwill and Intangible Assets Significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations. We typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the income method, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. The valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion, Company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. For example, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. In addition, changes to, or a failure to, achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates, leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses. We test individual indefinite lived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets. The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two step process. In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. The second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination. If the resulting implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, all customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. Impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized, but are tested separately at least annually for impairment. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high. Both of these wholly-acquired reporting units have fair value cushions that currently exceed the underlying carrying values. However, the Shave Care cushion, as well as the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset cushion, have been reduced to below 10% due in large part to an increased competitive market environment in the U.S., a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits and significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar that have occurred in recent years and resulted in reduced cash flow projections. As a result, this unit is more susceptible to impairment risk from adverse changes in business operating plans, category development and macroeconomic environment conditions, including any further significant devaluation of major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. While management has implemented strategies to address these events, adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of the business unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles (carrying values of Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as of June 30, 2017 are $19 billion and $16 billion, respectively). See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing results.

The Procter  Gamble Company 29 OTHER INFORMATION Hedging and Derivative Financial Instruments As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. Except within financing operations, we leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the CorporateManager value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics dataset as of June 30, 2017 . In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics, a reasonable proxy is included. Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term. Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments. Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2017 , including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements. Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months. In addition, we have entered into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions. Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2017 , we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements. Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures. As of and during the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 , we did not have any commodity hedging activity. Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAP Our discussion of financial results includes several \"non-GAAP\" financial measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e. trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. These measures include: Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of the Venezuela deconsolidation, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis, and this measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. 30 The Procter  Gamble Company The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth: ##TABLE_START Year ended June 30, 2017 Net Sales Growth Foreign Exchange Impact Acquisition/Divestiture Impact (1) Organic Sales Growth Beauty  % % % % Grooming (3 )% % %  % Health Care % % % % Fabric  Home Care  % % % % Baby, Feminine  Family Care (1 )% %  % % TOTAL COMPANY  % %  % %      Year ended June 30, 2016 Net Sales Growth Foreign Exchange Impact Acquisition/Divestiture Impact (1) Organic Sales Growth Beauty (9 )% % %  % Grooming (8 )% % % % Health Care (5 )% % % % Fabric  Home Care (7 )% % % % Baby, Feminine  Family Care (9 )% % % (1 )% TOTAL COMPANY (8 )% % % % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Acquisition/Divestiture Impact also includes the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and the rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. ##TABLE_END Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding certain divestiture impacts (tax payments related to certain divestitures). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions): ##TABLE_START  Operating Cash Flow Capital Spending Divestiture impacts (1) Adjusted Free Cash Flow $ 12,753 $ (3,384 ) $ $ 9,787 15,435 (3,314 )  12,121 14,608 (3,736 ) 11,601 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Divestiture impacts relate to tax payments for the Beauty Brands divestiture in fiscal 2017 and the Pet Care divestiture in fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_END Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding Batteries impairments, the gain on the sale of the Batteries and Beauty Brands businesses, the loss on early debt extinguishment and the Venezuela deconsolidation charges. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand PGs ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions): ##TABLE_START  Net Earnings Adjustments to Net Earnings (1) Net Earnings Excluding Adjustments Adjusted Free Cash Flow Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity $ 15,411 $ (4,990 ) $ 10,421 $ 9,787 % 10,604 (72 ) 10,532 12,121 % 7,144 4,187 11,331 11,601 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Adjustments to Net Earnings relate to the loss on early debt extinguishment and gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands business in fiscal 2017, the gain on the sale of the Batteries business and the Batteries impairment in fiscal 2016, and the Batteries impairment and Venezuela deconsolidation charges in fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_END The Procter  Gamble Company 31 Core EPS. Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Management views these non-GAAP measures as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. The table below provides a reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS, including the following reconciling items: ##TABLE_START  Incremental restructuring : The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. Beginning in 2012 Procter  Gamble began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities. In 2017, the company announced elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan. These plans result in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Early debt extinguishment charges : During fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a charge of $345 million after tax due to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. This charge represents the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Charges for certain European legal matters : Several countries in Europe issued separate complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in prior periods. The Company established Legal Reserves related to these charges. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Venezuela deconsolidation charge : For accounting purposes, evolving conditions resulted in a lack of control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Therefore, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation, effective June 30, 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. The charge was incurred to write off our net assets related to Venezuela. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Venezuela balance sheet remeasurement  devaluation impacts : Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. Prior to deconsolidation, the government enacted episodic changes to currency exchange mechanisms and rates, which resulted in currency remeasurement charges for non-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by our Venezuelan subsidiaries. ##TABLE_END We do not view the above items to be indicative of underlying business results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. ##TABLE_START THE PROCTER  GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2017  AS REPORTED (GAAP)  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  INCREMENTAL RESTRUCTURING  EARLY DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT  ROUNDING  NON-GAAP (CORE) COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD $ 32,535  $   $ (498 )  $   $   $ 32,037 SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 18,568         18,667 OPERATING INCOME 13,955         14,354 INCOME TAX ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS 3,063        3,381 NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PG 15,326  (5,217 )    (1 )  10,732            Core EPS DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE* $ 5.59  $ (1.90 )  $ 0.10  $ 0.13  $   $ 3.92 ##TABLE_END* Diluted net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble. ##TABLE_START  CHANGE VERSUS YEAR AGO    CORE EPS %  ##TABLE_END32 The Procter  Gamble Company ##TABLE_START THE PROCTER  GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2016  AS REPORTED (GAAP)  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  INCREMENTAL RESTRUCTURING  CHARGES FOR EUROPEAN LEGAL MATTERS  ROUNDING  NON-GAAP (CORE) COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD $ 32,909  $   $ (624 )  $   $   $ 32,285 SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 18,949     (13 )    18,967 OPERATING INCOME 13,441        14,047 INCOME TAX ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS 3,342      (1 )  3,437 NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PG 10,508  (577 )      10,441            Core EPS DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE* $ 3.69  $ (0.20 )  $ 0.18  $   $   $ 3.67 ##TABLE_END* Diluted net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble. ##TABLE_START  CHANGE VERSUS YEAR AGO    CORE EPS (2 )%  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START THE PROCTER  GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2015  AS REPORTED (GAAP)  DISCON-TINUED OPERATIONS  INCRE-MENTAL RESTRUC-TURING  VENEZUELA BALANCE SHEET DEVALUA-TION  VENEZUELA DECONSOL-IDATION  CHARGES FOR EUROPEAN LEGAL MATTERS  ROUND-ING  NON-GAAP (CORE) COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD $ 37,056  $   $ (518 )  $   $   $   $ (1 )  $ 36,537 SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 20,616    (103 )  (138 )    (28 )   20,348 OPERATING INCOME 11,049      2,028     13,864 INCOME TAX ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS 2,725      (24 )    (1 )  2,879 NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PG 7,036  1,153    2,052    10,850                Core EPS DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE* $ 2.44  $ 0.40  $ 0.17  $ 0.04  $ 0.71  $ 0.01  $ (0.01 )  $ 3.76 ##TABLE_END", "7A": " Item 7A.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of The Procter  Gamble Company (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Strong internal controls is an objective that is reinforced through our Worldwide Business Conduct Manual , which sets forth our commitment to conduct business with integrity, and within both the letter and the spirit of the law. Our people are deeply committed to our Purpose, Values, and Principles, which unite us in doing whats right. Our system of internal controls includes written policies and procedures, segregation of duties, and the careful selection and development of employees. Additional key elements of our internal control structure include our Global Leadership Council, which is actively involved in oversight of the business strategies, initiatives, results and controls, our Disclosure Committee, which is responsible for evaluating disclosure implications of significant business activities and events, our Board of Directors, which provides strong and effective corporate governance, and our Audit Committee, which reviews significant accounting policies, financial reporting and internal control matters. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes a Control Self-Assessment Program that is conducted annually for critical financial reporting areas of the Company and is audited by our Global Internal Audit organization. Management takes the appropriate action to correct any identified control deficiencies. Global Internal Audit also performs financial and compliance audits around the world, provides training, and continuously improves our internal control processes. Because of its inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, may not prevent or detect misstatements due to the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden or that misstatements due to error or fraud may occur that are not detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2017 , using criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2017 , based on these criteria. Deloitte  Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2017 , as stated in their report which is included herein. ##TABLE_START /s/ David S.

Moeller Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer  August 7, 2017 ##TABLE_END34 The Procter  Gamble Company REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Procter  Gamble Company Cincinnati, Ohio We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Shareholders' Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2017 . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries at June 30, 2017 and 2016 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2017 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2017 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 7, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP Cincinnati, Ohio  August 7, 2017 ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company 35 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Procter  Gamble Company Cincinnati, Ohio We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2017 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

The Procter  Gamble Company 41 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations The Procter  Gamble Company's (the \"Company,\" \"Procter  Gamble,\" \"we\" or \"us\") business is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated. There are a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions in Venezuela, which have evolved over time and may continue to evolve in the future. These evolving conditions resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar and restricted our Venezuelan operations ability to pay dividends and satisfy certain other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars. For accounting purposes, this resulted in a lack of control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Therefore, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation, effective June 30, 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. This resulted in a write-off of all of the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries, along with Venezuela related assets held by other subsidiaries. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2016, our financial results only include sales of finished goods to our Venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent we receive payments from Venezuela. Accordingly, we no longer include the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries operations in our financial results. Use of Estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, consumer and trade promotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, post-employment benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax positions and contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although management does not generally believe such differences would materially affect the financial statements in any individual year. However, in regard to ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those anticipated at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that materially affect the financial statements in a given year. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned. Revenue transactions represent sales of inventory. The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. The revenue includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to the customer. Our policy is to recognize revenue when title to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period the revenue is recognized. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred, generally at the time of the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in the Accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacturing of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product. Cost of products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense (SGA) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items. Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $1.9 billion in 2017 , $1.9 billion in 2016 and $2.0 billion in 2015 (reported in Net earnings from continuing operations). Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include worldwide television, print, radio, internet and in-store advertising expenses and were $7.1 billion in 2017 , $7.2 billion in 2016 and $7.2 billion in 2015 (reported in Net earnings from continuing operations). Non-advertising related components of the Company's total Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 42 The Procter  Gamble Company marketing spending reported in SGA include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids. Other Non-Operating Income/(Expense), Net Other non-operating income/(expense), net, primarily includes net acquisition and divestiture gains, investment income and other non-operating items. Currency Translation Financial statements of operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in Other comprehensive income (OCI). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Re-measurement adjustments for financial statements in highly inflationary economies and other transactional exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. Cash Flow Presentation The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method, which reconciles net earnings to cash flow from operating activities. Cash flows from foreign currency transactions and operations are translated at an average exchange rate for the period. Cash flows from hedging activities are included in the same category as the items being hedged. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as financing activities. Realized gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative instruments used to hedge currency exposures resulting from intercompany financing transactions are also classified as financing activities. Cash flows from other derivative instruments used to manage interest, commodity or other currency exposures are classified as operating activities. Cash payments related to income taxes are classified as operating activities. Cash flows from the Company's discontinued operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 13 for significant cash flow items related to discontinued operations. Investments Investment securities consist of readily marketable debt and equity securities. Unrealized gains or losses from investments classified as trading, if any, are charged to earnings. Unrealized gains or losses on securities classified as available-for-sale are generally recorded in OCI. If an available-for-sale security is other than temporarily impaired, the loss is charged to either earnings or OCI depending on our intent and ability to retain the security until we recover the full cost basis and the extent of the loss attributable to the creditworthiness of the issuer. Investment securities are included as Available-for-sale investment securities and Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Investments in certain companies over which we exert significant influence, but do not control the financial and operating decisions, are accounted for as equity method investments. Other investments that are not controlled, and over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method. Both equity and cost method investments are included as Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value. Product-related inventories are maintained on the first-in, first-out method. The cost of spare part inventories is maintained using the average-cost method. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized over the assets' estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Machinery and equipment includes office furniture and fixtures ( 15 -year life), computer equipment and capitalized software ( 3 - to 5 -year lives) and manufacturing equipment ( 3 - to 20 -year lives). Buildings are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 40 years. Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, when appropriate, changes are made prospectively. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. Our annual impairment testing of goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. We have acquired brands that have been determined to have indefinite lives. Those assets are evaluated annually for impairment. We evaluate a number of factors to determine whether an indefinite life is appropriate, including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. In addition, when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an additional impairment assessment is performed and indefinite-lived assets may be adjusted to a determinable life. The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology and other intangible assets with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives. Customer relationships, brands and other non-contractual intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over periods generally ranging from 5 to 30 years. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and remaining lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted. For additional details on goodwill and intangible assets see Note 4. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 43 Fair Values of Financial Instruments Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Changes in assumptions or estimation methods could affect the fair value estimates; however, we do not believe any such changes would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, certain investments and short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair values of long-term debt and financial instruments are disclosed in Note 9. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This guidance outlines a single, comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. We plan to adopt the standard on July 1, 2018. While we are currently assessing the impact of the new standard, our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single delivery element and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer. The timing of revenue recognition is not impacted by the new standard. The provisions of the new standard may impact the classification of certain payments to customers, moving an immaterial amount of such payments from expense to a deduction from net sales. The impact would reduce net sales by less than 1%. We are still assessing the impact on financial disclosures related to the new standard. We do not expect this new guidance to have any other material impacts on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.\" This guidance simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes on the balance sheet by requiring that all deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current. The new standard is effective for us beginning July 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt the new guidance on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 . The impact was not significant. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842).\" The standard requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements. We plan to adopt the standard on July 1, 2019. We are currently assessing the impact that the new standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which will consist primarily of a balance sheet gross up of our operating leases to show equal and offsetting lease assets and lease liabilities. For additional details on operating leases, see Note 12. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, \"Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" which changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires excess tax benefits (which represent the excess of actual tax benefits received at vest or settlement over the benefits recognized at issuance of share-based payments) and tax deficiencies (which represent the amount by which actual tax benefits received at vest or settlement is lower than the benefits recognized at issuance of share-based payments) to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The amended guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows, rather than a financing activity. The standard further provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than utilizing the estimated amount of forfeitures at the time of issuance. The new standard is effective for us beginning July 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt the new guidance on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 . The primary impact of adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits in our Income taxes on continuing operations rather than in Additional paid-in capital for fiscal year 2017 . As a result, we recognized excess tax benefits of $169 in Income taxes on continuing operations during fiscal year 2017 . We also elected to adopt the cash flow presentation of the excess tax benefits prospectively commencing in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 . We have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period. The adoption of this amended guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring a goodwill impairment to be measured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety. This eliminates the second step of the current impairment model that requires companies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit and measure impairments based on those fair values and a residual measurement approach. It also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We will adopt the standard no later than July 1, 2020. The impact of the new standard will be dependent on the specific facts and circumstances of future individual impairments, if any. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, \"Compensation-Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (Topic 715). This guidance requires an entity to disaggregate the current service cost component from the other components of net benefit costs in the face of the income statement. It requires the service cost component to be presented with other current compensation costs for the related employees in the operating section of the income statement, with other components of net benefit cost presented outside of income from operations. We will adopt the standard retrospectively no later than July 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2017-07 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We currently classify all net periodic pension costs within operating costs (as part of Cost of products sold and Selling, general and administrative expense). Had this standard been effective and adopted during fiscal 2017 , Cost of products sold Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 44 The Procter  Gamble Company and Selling, general and administrative costs would have increased approximately $104 and $85 , respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2017 with a corresponding increase in Other non-operating income/(expense), net. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOTE 2 SEGMENT INFORMATION During fiscal 2017 , the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories, comprised of 43 of its beauty brands. The transactions included the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and the fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. In fiscal 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business to Berkshire Hathaway. The Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care business in fiscal year 2015. Each of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented (see Note 13). Under U.S. GAAP, our remaining Global Business Units (GBUs) are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty , 2) Grooming , 3) Health Care , 4) Fabric  Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine  Family Care . Our five reportable segments are comprised of: ##TABLE_START  Beauty : Hair Care (Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Grooming : Shave Care (Female Blades  Razors, Male Blades  Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care); Appliances ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Health Care : Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fabric  Home Care : Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, PG Professional, Surface Care ); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Baby, Feminine  Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper). ##TABLE_END The accounting policies of the segments are generally the same as those described in Note 1. Differences between these policies and U.S. GAAP primarily reflect income taxes, which are reflected in the segments using applicable blended statutory rates. Adjustments to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate. Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities that are not reflected in the operating results used internally to measure and evaluate the businesses, as well as items to adjust management reporting principles to U.S. GAAP. Operating activities in Corporate include the results of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Operating elements also include certain employee benefit costs, the costs of certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization, certain significant asset impairment and deconsolidation charges, certain balance sheet impacts from significant foreign exchange devaluations and other general Corporate items. The non-operating elements in Corporate primarily include interest expense, certain acquisition and divestiture gains and interest and investing income. Total assets for the reportable segments include those assets managed by the reportable segment, primarily inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets. Other assets, primarily cash, accounts receivable, investment securities and goodwill, are included in Corporate. Our business units are comprised of similar product categories. Nine business units individually accounted for 5% or more of consolidated net sales as follows: ##TABLE_START % of Sales by Business Unit (1) Years ended June 30   Fabric Care 22%  22%  22% Baby Care 14%  14%  15% Hair Care 10%  10%  11% Home Care 10%  10%  9% Shave Care 9%  9%  9% Family Care 8%  8%  8% Oral Care 8%  8%  8% Skin and Personal Care 8%  8%  7% Feminine Care 6%  6%  6% All Other 5%  5%  5% TOTAL 100%  100%  100% ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  % of sales by business unit excludes sales held in Corporate. ##TABLE_END The Company had net sales in the U.S. of $27.3 billion , $27.0 billion and $26.8 billion for the years ended June 30, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Long-lived assets in the U.S. totaled $8.8 billion and $8.5 billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Long-lived assets consists of property, plant and equipment. No other country's net sales or long-lived assets exceed 10% of the Company totals. Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 16% of consolidated net sales in 2017 , and 15% of consolidated net sales in 2016 and 2015 . No other customer represents more than 10% of our consolidated net sales. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.

Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually. In fiscal 2012, the Company initiated an incremental restructuring program as part of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The productivity and cost savings plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the Company's growth strategy. The Company incurred $5.6 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a six year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017), including costs incurred as part of the incremental restructuring program. The program included a non- manufacturing overhead enrollment reduction target of approximately 25% - 30% by the end of fiscal year 2017 . Through fiscal 2017 , the Company reduced non-manufacturing enrollment by approximately 26% . The reductions were enabled by the elimination of duplicate work, simplification through the use of technology and optimization of various functional and business organizations and the Company's global footprint. In addition, the plan included integration of newly acquired companies and the optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. In fiscal 2017 the Company announced specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. Over the next two fiscal years (fiscal 2018 and 2019 ), the Company expects to incur approximately $1.2 billion total before-tax restructuring costs under the plan. This program is expected to result in meaningful additional non-manufacturing enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs. The Company incurred total restructuring charges of approximately $754 and $977 for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Approximately $137 and $202 of these charges were recorded in SGA for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively and approximately $593 and $718 of these charges were recorded in Cost of products sold for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The remainder of the charges were included in Net earnings from discontinued operations. Of the total costs incurred since the inception of this restructuring program, $2.5 billion were related to separations, $1.8 billion were asset-related and $1.3 billion were related to other restructuring-type costs. The following table presents restructuring activity for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 : ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions Separations Asset-Related Costs Other Total RESERVE JUNE 30, 2015 $ $  $ $ Charges 432 977 Cash spent (381 )  (238 ) (619 ) Charges against assets  (432 )  (432 ) RESERVE JUNE 30, 2016  315 Charges 397 754 Cash spent (1) (221 )  (174 ) (395 ) Charges against assets  (397 )  (397 ) RESERVE JUNE 30, 2017 $ $  $ $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Includes liabilities transferred to Coty related to our Beauty Brands divestiture. ##TABLE_ENDAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 47 Separation Costs Employee separation charges for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 , related to severance packages for approximately 2,120 and 2,770 employees, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 , these severance packages included approximately 380 and 920 non-manufacturing employees, respectively. The packages were predominantly voluntary and the amounts were calculated based on salary levels and past service periods. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Since its inception, the restructuring program has incurred separation charges related to approximately 19,190 employees, of which approximately 9,920 are non-manufacturing overhead personnel. Asset-Related Costs Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal. These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other Costs Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program. Such charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain optimization. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges are funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting. Accordingly, all of the charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment. However, for informative purposes, the following table summarizes the total restructuring costs related to our reportable segments: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30 2016 Beauty $ $ $ Grooming 42 Health Care 26 Fabric  Home Care 250 Baby, Feminine  Family Care 225 Corporate (1) 362 Total Company $ $ $ 1,068 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Corporate includes costs related to allocated overheads, including charges related to our Sales and Market Operations, Global Business Services and Corporate Functions activities and costs related to discontinued operations from our Batteries and Beauty Brands businesses. ##TABLE_ENDAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 48 The Procter  Gamble Company NOTE 4 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS The change in the net carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment was as follows: ##TABLE_START  Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric  Home Care Baby, Feminine  Family Care Corporate Total Company Balance at June 30, 2015 - Net (1) (2) 12,704 19,619 5,876 1,874 4,549  44,622 Acquisitions and divestitures (2 )  (2 )    (4 ) Translation and other (57 ) (142 ) (34 ) (18 ) (17 )  (268 ) Balance at June 30, 2016 - Net (1) 12,645 19,477 5,840 1,856 4,532  44,350 Acquisitions and divestitures   (10 ) (3 ) (24 )  (37 ) Translation and other 150 4  Balance at June 30, 2017 - Net (1) $ 12,791 $ 19,627 $ 5,878 $ 1,857 $ 4,546 $  $ 44,699 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Grooming goodwill balance is net of $1.2 billion accumulated impairment losses. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The Batteries goodwill at June 30, 2015 , net of $2.1 billion accumulated impairment losses, was reported in Current assets held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Batteries business was divested in February 2016. ##TABLE_END During fiscal 2017 , the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories, comprised of 43 of its beauty brands (\"Beauty Brands\"). The transactions included the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color and cosmetics businesses and the fine fragrances business, along with select hair styling brands (see Note 13). The Beauty Brands have historically been part of the Company's Beauty reportable segment. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Beauty Brands are presented as discontinued operations. As a result, the goodwill attributable to the Beauty Brands as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 is excluded from the preceding table and is reported as Current assets held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2016. In February 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business to Berkshire Hathaway (BH). Prior to the transaction, the Company recorded a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge of $402 ( $350 after tax) during fiscal 2016 , which reflected the value of BH's shares in PG stock as of the date of the impairment charges (see Note 13). This impairment charge as well as accumulated Batteries impairment charges totaling $2.1 billion through fiscal 2015 were included as part of discontinued operations. The change in goodwill during fiscal 2017 and the remaining change during fiscal 2016 was primarily due to currency translation across all reportable segments. All of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges that are not reflected in discontinued operations are included in Corporate for segment reporting. The goodwill and intangible asset valuations are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those used in our valuations. To the extent such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows used to estimate fair value, we may need to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future. Identifiable intangible assets were comprised of: ##TABLE_START   As of June 30 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization  Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DETERMINABLE LIVES Brands $ 3,094 $ (1,898 )  $ 3,409 $ (2,032 ) Patents and technology 2,617 (2,261 )  2,624 (2,164 ) Customer relationships 1,377 (564 )  1,382 (514 ) Other (132 )  (130 ) TOTAL $ 7,327 $ (4,855 )  $ 7,661 $ (4,840 )       INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES Brands 21,715   21,706  TOTAL $ 29,042 $ (4,855 )  $ 29,367 $ (4,840 ) ##TABLE_ENDDue to the divestiture of the Beauty Brands, intangible assets specific to this business as of June 30, 2016 are reported in Current assets held for sale in accordance with the accounting principles for assets held for sale.

Changes in uncertain tax positions represent changes in our net liability related to prior year tax positions. Excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options reflect the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09, \"Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee-Share-Based Payment Accounting).\" Tax costs charged to shareholders' equity totaled $333 for the year ended June 30, 2017 . This primarily relates to the impact of certain adjustments to pension obligations recorded in stockholders' equity, partially offset by the tax effects of net investment hedges. Tax benefits credited to shareholders' equity totaled $899 for the year ended June 30, 2016 . This primarily relates to the impact of certain adjustments to pension obligations recorded in stockholders' equity and the impact of excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. We have undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $49 billion at June 30, 2017 , for which deferred taxes have not been provided. Such earnings are considered indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiaries. If such earnings were repatriated, additional tax expense may result. However, the calculation of the amount of deferred U.S. income tax on these earnings is not practicable because of the large number of assumptions necessary to compute the tax. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for uncertain tax positions is as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   BEGINNING OF YEAR $  $ 1,096  $ 1,437 Increases in tax positions for prior years   Decreases in tax positions for prior years (147 )  (97 )  (146 ) Increases in tax positions for current year   Settlements with taxing authorities (381 )  (301 )  (250 ) Lapse in statute of limitations (22 )  (39 )  (27 ) Currency translation (4 )  (23 )  (123 ) END OF YEAR $  $  $ 1,096 ##TABLE_ENDIncluded in the total liability for uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2017 , is $284 that, depending on the ultimate resolution, could impact the effective tax rate in future periods. The Company is present in approximately 140 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 50 - 60 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and the closing of statutes of Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 50 The Procter  Gamble Company limitation. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit. While we do not expect material changes, it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to our uncertain tax positions could increase or decrease within the next 12 months. At this time, we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of uncertain tax positions or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items. We recognize the additional accrual of any possible related interest and penalties relating to the underlying uncertain tax position in income tax expense. As of June 30, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we had accrued interest of $100 , $323 and $347 and accrued penalties of $20 , $20 and $19 , respectively, which are not included in the above table. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we recognized $62 , $2 and $15 in interest benefit/(expense) and $0 , $(2) and $13 in penalties benefit/(expense), respectively. The net benefits recognized resulted primarily from the favorable resolution of tax positions for prior years.

In our main long-term incentive program, key managers can elect to receive options or RSUs. All options granted vest after three years. Exercise prices on options granted have been, and continue to be, set equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of the grant. The stock options granted from July 1998 through August 2002 had a 15 -year life and expired during fiscal year 2017. The options granted since September 2002 have a 10 -year life. RSUs granted in February 2017 vest and settle in shares of common stock three years from the grant date. RSUs granted prior to February 2017 vest and settle in shares of common stock five years from the grant date. Senior-level executives participate in an additional long-term incentive program that awards PSUs, which are paid in shares after the end of a three-year performance period. Under this program, the number of PSUs that will vest is based on the Company's performance relative to pre-established performance goals during that three year period. In addition to these long-term incentive programs, we award RSUs to the Company's directors and make other minor stock option and RSU grants to employees for which the terms are not substantially different than our long-term incentive awards. A total of 185 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the stock-based compensation plan approved by shareholders in 2014. A total of 95 million shares remain available for grant under the 2014 plan. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards at the date of grant. The fair value is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are recognized as compensation expense from the grant date through the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide services to earn the award. Stock-based compensation expense, which is included as part of Cost of products sold and SGA in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, and the related tax benefit were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   Stock options $  $  $ RSUs and PSUs   Total stock-based expense (1) $  $  $       Income tax benefit (1) $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Includes amounts related to discontinued operations, which are not material in any period presented. ##TABLE_ENDWe utilize an industry standard lattice-based valuation model to calculate the fair value for stock options granted. Assumptions utilized in the model, which are evaluated and revised to reflect market conditions and experience, were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   Interest rate 0.8 - 2.6 %  0.7 - 1.9 %  0.1 - 2.1 % Weighted average interest rate 2.6 %  1.8 %  2.0 % Dividend yield 3.2 %  3.2 %  3.1 % Expected volatility - %  - %  - % Weighted average volatility %  %  % Expected life in years 9.6   8.3   8.3  ##TABLE_ENDLattice-based option valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs and those ranges are disclosed in the preceding table. Expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatilities of call options on our stock. We use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination patterns within the valuation model. The expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. A summary of options, RSUs and PSUs outstanding under the plans as of June 30, 2017 and activity during the year then ended is presented below: ##TABLE_START Options Options (in thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Contract-ual Life in Years Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding, beginning of year 230,397 $ 68.02   Granted 21,425 90.70   Exercised (44,070 ) 59.11   Canceled (1,267 ) 69.76   OUTSTANDING, END OF YEAR 206,485 $ 72.46 5.4 $ 3,109 EXERCISABLE 140,803 $ 66.71 3.9 $ 2,878 ##TABLE_ENDThe weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted was $10.45 , $8.48 and $9.38 per share in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

The total grant-date fair value of options that vested during 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $246 , $200 and $241 , respectively. At June 30, 2017 , there was $208 of compensation cost that has not yet been recognized related to stock option grants. That cost is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 2.0 years. Cash received from options exercised was $2,630 , $2,332 and $2,631 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

The total grant date fair value of shares vested was $163 , $97 and $79 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The Company settles equity issuances with treasury shares. We have no specific policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options, RSUs and PSUs. However, we have historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash availability, market trends and other factors, to offset the impacts of such activity. NOTE 8 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN We offer various postretirement benefits to our employees. Defined Contribution Retirement Plans We have defined contribution plans, which cover the majority of our U.S. employees, as well as employees in certain other countries. These plans are fully funded. We generally make contributions to participants' accounts based on individual base salaries and years of service. Total global defined contribution expense was $270 , $292 and $305 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The primary U.S. defined contribution plan (the U.S. DC plan) comprises the majority of the expense for the Company's defined contribution plans. For the U.S. DC plan, the contribution rate is set annually. Total contributions for this plan approximated 14% of total participants' annual wages and salaries in 2017 in 2016 and 2015 . We maintain The Procter  Gamble Profit Sharing Trust (Trust) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) to provide a portion of the funding for the U.S. DC plan and other retiree benefits (described below). Operating details of the ESOP are provided at the end of this Note. The fair value of the ESOP Series A shares allocated to participants reduces our cash contribution required to fund the U.S. DC plan. Defined Benefit Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits We offer defined benefit retirement pension plans to certain employees. These benefits relate primarily to local plans outside the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, plans assumed in previous acquisitions covering U.S. employees. We also provide certain other retiree benefits, primarily health care and life insurance, for the majority of our U.S. employees, who become eligible for these benefits when they meet minimum age and service requirements. Generally, the health care plans require cost sharing with retirees and pay a stated percentage of expenses, reduced by deductibles and other coverages. These benefits are primarily funded by ESOP Series B shares and certain other assets contributed by the Company. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 54 The Procter  Gamble Company Obligation and Funded Status .

In these instances, benefit payments are typically paid directly from the Company's cash as they become due. ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits Years ended June 30    CLASSIFICATION OF NET AMOUNT RECOGNIZED        Noncurrent assets $  $  $   $  Current liabilities (40 )  (33 )  (23 )  (21 ) Noncurrent liabilities (5,487 )  (6,761 )  (1,333 )  (1,808 ) NET AMOUNT RECOGNIZED $ (5,331 )  $ (6,614 )  $ (1,356 )  $ (1,829 ) AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI)   Net actuarial loss $ 4,548  $ 6,088  $ 1,819  $ 2,247 Prior service cost/(credit)   (293 )  (334 ) NET AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN AOCI $ 4,793  $ 6,358  $ 1,526  $ 1,913 ##TABLE_ENDAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.

We determine our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis. These assumptions are weighted to reflect each country that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits. The weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, were as follows: (1)  ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits As of June 30    Discount rate 2.4 %  2.1 %  3.9 %  3.6 % Rate of compensation increase 3.0 %  2.9 %  N/A  N/A Health care cost trend rates assumed for next year N/A  N/A  6.4 %  7.2 % Rate to which the health care cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend rate) N/A  N/A  4.9 %  4.9 % Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate N/A  N/A   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Determined as of end of year. ##TABLE_END The weighted average assumptions used to determine net benefit cost recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the years ended June 30, were as follows: (1)  ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits Years ended June 30      Discount rate 2.1 %  3.1 %  3.5 %  3.6 %  4.5 %  4.4 % Expected return on plan assets 6.9 %  7.2 %  7.2 %  8.3 %  8.3 %  8.3 % Rate of compensation increase 2.9 %  3.1 %  3.2 %  N/A  N/A  N/A ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Determined as of beginning of year. ##TABLE_END For the fiscal year 2017 , the Company changed its method of determining service and interest costs for plans that make up the majority of our obligation from the single weighted average discount rate approach to specific spot rates along the yield curve, which management has concluded is a more precise estimate. Prior to this change in methodology, the Company measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. The Company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, has accounted for it on a prospective basis. This change does not impact the benefit obligation and did not have a material impact on fiscal year 2017 results. Several factors are considered in developing the estimate for the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets. For the defined benefit retirement plans, these factors include historical rates of return of broad equity and bond indices and projected long-term rates of return obtained from pension investment consultants. The expected long-term rates of return for plan assets are 8 - 9% for equities and 5 - 6% for bonds. For other retiree benefit plans, the expected long-term rate of return reflects that the assets are comprised primarily of Company stock. The expected rate of return on Company stock is based on the long-term projected return of 8.5% and reflects the historical pattern of returns. Assumed health care cost trend rates could have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other retiree benefit plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: ##TABLE_START  One-Percentage Point Increase  One-Percentage Point Decrease Effect on the total service and interest cost components $  $ (55 ) Effect on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation  (697 ) ##TABLE_ENDPlan Assets . Our investment objective for defined benefit retirement plan assets is to meet the plans' benefit obligations and to improve plan self-sufficiency for future benefit obligations. The investment strategies focus on asset class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit payments and an appropriate balance of long-term investment return and risk. Target ranges for asset allocations are determined by assessing different investment risks and matching the actuarial projections of the plans' future liabilities and benefit payments with current as well as expected long-term rates of return on the assets, taking into account investment return volatility and correlations across asset classes. Plan assets are diversified across several investment managers and are generally invested in liquid funds that are selected to track broad market equity and bond indices. Investment risk is carefully controlled with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and with continual monitoring of investment managers' performance relative to the investment guidelines established with each investment manager. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 57 Our target asset allocation for the year ended June 30, 2017 , and actual asset allocation by asset category as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 , were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Target Asset Allocation  Actual Asset Allocation at June 30  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits Asset Category      Cash %  %  %  %  %  % Debt securities %  %  %  %  %  % Equity securities %  %  %  %  %  % TOTAL %  %  %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDThe following tables set forth the fair value of the Company's plan assets as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy (refer to Note 9 for further discussion on the fair value hierarchy and fair value principles). Company stock listed as Level 2 in the hierarchy represents preferred shares which are valued based on the value of Company common stock. The majority of our Level 3 pension assets are insurance contracts. Their fair values are based on their cash equivalent or models that project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs, including credit risk and interest rate curves. There was no significant activity within the Level 3 pension and other retiree benefits plan assets during the years presented. Investments valued using net asset value as a practical expedient are primarily equity and fixed income collective funds. These assets are not valued using the fair value hierarchy, but rather valued using the net asset value reported by the managers of the funds and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. For additional details on the fair value hierarchy, see Note 9. ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits As of June 30 Fair Value Hierarchy Level    Fair Value Hierarchy Level   ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE            Cash and cash equivalents  $  $   $  $ Company stock (1)        3,643  3,545 Other (2) 1, 2  3       TOTAL ASSETS IN THE FAIR VALUE HEIRARCHY   $  $    $ 3,656  $ 3,615 Investments valued at net asset value   $ 10,530  9,952    $  TOTAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE   $ 10,829  10,269    $ 3,831  3,787 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Company stock is net of ESOP debt discussed below. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The Company's other pension plan assets measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. There are no material other pension plan asset balances classified as Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. ##TABLE_ENDCash Flows . Management's best estimate of cash requirements and discretionary contributions for the defined benefit retirement plans and other retiree benefit plans for the year ending June 30, 2018 , is $125 and $39 , respectively. For the defined benefit retirement plans, this is comprised of $75 in expected benefit payments from the Company directly to participants of unfunded plans and $50 of expected contributions to funded plans. For other retiree benefit plans, this is comprised of $24 in expected benefit payments from the Company directly to participants of unfunded plans and $15 of expected contributions to funded plans. Expected contributions are dependent on many variables, including the variability of the market value of the plan assets as compared to the benefit obligation and other market or regulatory conditions. In addition, we take into consideration our business investment opportunities and resulting cash requirements. Accordingly, actual funding may differ significantly from current estimates. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 58 The Procter  Gamble Company Total benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which include payments funded from the Company's assets and payments from the plans are as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ending June 30 Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS   $  $ 2019  2020  2021  2022  2023 - 2027 3,221  1,334 ##TABLE_ENDEmployee Stock Ownership Plan We maintain the ESOP to provide funding for certain employee benefits discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The ESOP borrowed $1.0 billion in 1989 and the proceeds were used to purchase Series A ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the U.S. DC plan. Principal and interest requirements of the borrowing were paid by the Trust from dividends on the preferred shares and from advances provided by the Company. The original borrowing of $1.0 billion has been repaid in full, and advances from the Company of $62 remain outstanding at June 30, 2017 . Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock. The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $2.70 per share. The liquidation value is $6.82 per share. In 1991, the ESOP borrowed an additional $1.0 billion . The proceeds were used to purchase Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of retiree health care benefits. These shares, net of the ESOP's debt, are considered plan assets of the other retiree benefits plan discussed above. Debt service requirements are funded by preferred stock dividends, cash contributions and advances provided by the Company, of which $770 are outstanding at June 30, 2017 . Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock. The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $2.70 per share. The liquidation value is $12.96 per share. Our ESOP accounting practices are consistent with current ESOP accounting guidance, including the permissible continuation of certain provisions from prior accounting guidance. ESOP debt, which is guaranteed by the Company, is recorded as debt (see Note 10) with an offset to the Reserve for ESOP debt retirement, which is presented within Shareholders' equity. Advances to the ESOP by the Company are recorded as an increase in the Reserve for ESOP debt retirement. Interest incurred on the ESOP debt is recorded as Interest expense.

NOTE 9 RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. To the extent we choose to manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions that we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. At inception, we formally designate and document qualifying instruments as hedges of underlying exposures. We formally assess, at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. Fluctuations in the value of these instruments generally are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. This is driven by the high degree of effectiveness between the exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument. The ineffective portion of a change in the fair value of a qualifying instrument is immediately recognized in earnings. The amount of ineffectiveness recognized was immaterial for all years presented. Credit Risk Management We have counterparty credit guidelines and normally enter into transactions with investment grade financial institutions, to the extent commercially viable. Counterparty exposures are monitored daily and downgrades in counterparty credit ratings are reviewed on a timely basis. We have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, material credit losses on our risk management or other financial instruments. Substantially all of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 59 netting and collateral agreements with counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position as of June 30, 2017 , was not material. The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features. Interest Rate Risk Management Our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. To manage this risk in a cost-efficient manner, we enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to exchange with the counterparty, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional amount. Interest rate swaps that meet specific accounting criteria are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in Interest expense. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument is reported in OCI and reclassified into Interest expense over the life of the underlying debt obligation. The ineffective portion for both cash flow and fair value hedges, which was not material for any year presented, was immediately recognized in Interest expense. Foreign Currency Risk Management We manufacture and sell our products and finance our operations in a number of countries throughout the world. As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To manage the exchange rate risk primarily associated with the financing of our operations, we have historically used a combination of forward contracts, options and currency swaps. Historically, we have had currency swaps with original maturities up to five years , which were intended to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. These swaps were accounted for as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments was reported in OCI and reclassified into SGA and Interest expense in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affected earnings. The ineffective portion, which was not material for any year presented, was immediately recognized in SGA. The change in fair values of certain non-qualifying instruments used to manage foreign exchange exposure of intercompany financing transactions and certain balance sheet items subject to revaluation are immediately recognized in earnings, substantially offsetting the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposures. Net Investment Hedging We hedge certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries. To accomplish this, we either borrow directly in foreign currencies and designate all or a portion of the foreign currency debt as a hedge of the applicable net investment position or we enter into foreign currency swaps that are designated as hedges of net investments. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in OCI to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. The ineffective portion of these hedges, which was not material in any year presented, was immediately recognized in Interest expense. Commodity Risk Management Certain raw materials used in our products or production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. To manage the volatility related to anticipated purchases of certain of these materials, we have historically, on a limited basis, used futures and options with maturities generally less than one year and swap contracts with maturities up to five years . As of and during the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 , we did not have any commodity hedging activity. Insurance We self-insure for most insurable risks. However, we purchase insurance for Directors and Officers Liability and certain other coverage where it is required by law or by contract. Fair Value Hierarchy Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: ##TABLE_START  Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets. ##TABLE_END When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets or liabilities during the year. Our fair value estimates take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and our counterparties. When active market quotes are not available for financial assets and liabilities, we use industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including credit risk, interest rate curves, foreign currency rates and forward and spot prices for currencies. In circumstances where market-based observable inputs are not available, management judgment is used to develop assumptions to estimate fair value. Generally, the fair value of our Level 3 instruments is estimated as the net present value of expected future cash flows based on external inputs. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 60 The Procter  Gamble Company The following table sets forth the Company's financial assets as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period: ##TABLE_START  Fair Value Asset As of June 30  Investments:    U.S. government securities $ 6,297  $ 4,839 Corporate bond securities 3,271  1,407 Other investments  TOTAL $ 9,700  $ 6,274 ##TABLE_ENDInvestment securities are presented in Available-for-sale investment securities and Other noncurrent assets. The amortized cost of the U.S. government securities with maturities less than one year was $2,494 and $292 as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The amortized cost of the U.S. government securities with maturities between one and five years was $3,824 and $4,513 as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The amortized cost of corporate bond securities with maturities of less than a year was $730 and $382 as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The amortized cost of corporate bond securities with maturities between one and five years was $2,547 and $1,018 as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The Company's investments measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. There are no material investment balances classified as Level 1 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, or using net asset value as a practical expedient. Fair values are generally estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of long-term debt was $21,396 and $24,362 as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. This includes the current portion of debt instruments ( $1,694 and $2,761 as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively). Certain long-term debt approximates fair value. Certain long-term debt is not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. Long-term debt with fair value of $1,716 and $2,331 as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. All remaining long-term debt is classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Disclosures about Derivative Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of qualifying and non-qualifying derivative instruments used in hedging transactions as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 are as follows: ##TABLE_START As of June 30 Notional Amount  Fair Value Asset  Fair Value (Liability)      DERIVATIVES IN CASH FLOW HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS         Foreign currency contracts $   $  $   $  $   $ (63 ) DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS         Interest rate contracts $ 4,552  $ 4,993  $  $  $ (2 )  $  DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS     Net investment hedges $ 6,102  $ 3,013  $  $  $ (177 )  $ (115 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS         Foreign currency contracts $ 4,969  $ 6,482  $  $  $ (7 )  $ (38 ) ##TABLE_ENDAll derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. The decrease in the notional balance of foreign currency cash flow hedges is reflective of the decrease in the underlying intercompany loans. The increase in the notional balance of net investment hedges primarily reflects a movement into lower yielding foreign currency swaps. The decrease in the notional balance of foreign currency contracts not designated as hedging instruments reflects changes in the level of intercompany financing activity during the period. All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. In addition, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. Except for the impairment charges related to our Batteries business (see Note 4), there were no significant assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 .

The maximum obligation under some indemnifications is also not explicitly stated and, as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss on any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In certain situations, we guarantee loans for suppliers and customers. The total amount of guarantees issued under such arrangements is not material. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that have a material impact on our financial statements. Purchase Commitments and Operating Leases We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations are as follows:  ##TABLE_START Years ending June 30 2019 2021 Thereafter Purchase obligations $ $ $ $ $ $ ##TABLE_ENDSuch amounts represent minimum commitments under take-or-pay agreements with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. These amounts include purchase commitments related to service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced to third-party suppliers.

Due to the proprietary nature Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 63 of many of our materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination. We do not expect to incur penalty payments under these provisions that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We also lease certain property and equipment for varying periods. Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases, net of guaranteed sublease income, are as follows:  ##TABLE_START Years ending June 30 2019 2021 Thereafter Operating leases $ $ $ $ $ $ ##TABLE_ENDLitigation We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. NOTE 13 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories to Coty, Inc. (Coty). The divestiture included 41 of the Company's beauty brands (Beauty Brands), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and a majority of the fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. The form of the divestiture transaction was a Reverse Morris Trust split-off, in which PG shareholders were given the election to exchange their PG shares for shares of a new corporation that held the Beauty Brands (Galleria Co.), and then immediately exchange those shares for Coty shares. The value PG received in the transaction was $11.4 billion . The value was comprised of 105 million shares of common stock of the Company, which were tendered by shareholders of the Company and exchanged for the Galleria Co. shares, valued at approximately $9.4 billion , and the assumption of $1.9 billion of debt by Galleria Co. The shares tendered in the transaction were reflected as an addition to treasury stock and the cash received related to the debt assumed by Coty was reflected as an investing activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the final transaction of $5.3 billion , net of transaction and related costs. Two of the fine fragrance brands, Dolce  Gabbana and Christina Aguilera, were excluded from the divestiture. These brands were subsequently divested at amounts that approximated their adjusted carrying values. In February 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business to Berkshire Hathaway (BH) via a split transaction, in which the Company exchanged the Duracell Company, which the Company had infused with additional cash, to repurchase all 52.5 million shares of PG stock owned by BH. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 , the Company recorded non-cash, before-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived asset impairment charges of $402 ( $350 after tax), to reduce the Batteries carrying value to the total estimated proceeds based on the value of BHs shares in PG stock at the time of the impairment charges (see Note 4). The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the final transaction of $422 to reflect a subsequent increase in the final value of the BHs shares in PG stock. The total value of the transaction was $4.2 billion representing the value of the Duracell business and the cash infusion. The cash infusion of $1.7 billion was reflected as a purchase of treasury stock. On July 31, 2014, the Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care operations in North America, Latin America, and other selected countries to Mars, Incorporated (Mars) for $2.9 billion in an all-cash transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, Mars acquired our branded pet care products, our manufacturing sites in the United States and the majority of the employees working in the Pet Care business. The agreement included an option for Mars to acquire the Pet Care business in several additional countries, which was also completed in fiscal 2015. The European Union countries were not included in the agreement with Mars. In December 2014, the Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care operations in Western Europe to Spectrum Brands in an all-cash transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, Spectrum Brands acquired our branded pet care products, our manufacturing site in the Netherlands and the majority of the employees working in the Western Europe Pet Care business. The one-time after-tax impact of these transactions is not material. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Beauty Brands, Batteries and Pet Care businesses are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Additionally, the Beauty Brands' balance sheet positions are presented as assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016. The Beauty Brands were historically part of the Company's Beauty reportable segment. The Batteries business was historically part of the Company's Fabric  Home Care reportable segment. The Pet Care business was historically part of the Company's Health Care reportable segment. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 64 The Procter  Gamble Company On July 1, 2015, the Company adopted ASU 2014-08, which included new reporting and disclosure requirements for discontinued operations. The new requirements are effective for discontinued operations occurring on or after the adoption date, which includes the Beauty Brands divestiture. All other discontinued operations prior to July 1, 2015 are reported based on the previous disclosure requirements for discontinued operations, including the Batteries and Pet Care divestitures.

The purpose of this plan is to advance the interests of the Company by giving substantially all employees a stake in the Company's future growth and success and to strengthen the alignment of interests between employees and the Company's shareholders through increased ownership of shares of the Company's stock. The plan has not been submitted to shareholders for approval. Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company's capitalization, the number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 17 million shares. Under the plan's regulations, recipients are granted options to acquire 100 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price equal to the average price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant. These options vest five years after the date of grant and expire ten years following the date of grant. If a recipient leaves the employ of the Company prior to the vesting date for a reason other than disability, retirement or special separation (as defined in the plan), then the award is forfeited. At the time of the first grant following Board approval of the plan, each employee of the Company not eligible for an award under the 1992 Stock Plan was granted options for 100 shares. From the date of this first grant through June 30, 2003, each new employee of the Company has also received options for 100 shares. Following the grant of options on June 30, 2003, the Company suspended this part of the plan. The plan terminated on October 13, 2007. The Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan Shareholders of The Gillette Company approved The Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan on May 20, 2004, and the plan was assumed by the Company upon the merger between The Procter  Gamble Company and The Gillette Company. All options became immediately vested and exercisable on October 1, 2005 as a result of the merger. After the merger, all outstanding options became options to purchase shares of The Procter  Gamble Company subject to an exchange ratio of .975 shares of PG stock per share of Gillette stock. Only employees previously employed by The Gillette The Procter  Gamble Company 69 Company prior to October 1, 2005 are eligible to receive grants under this plan. The last grant of equity under this plan was on February 27, 2009. The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate employees of The Gillette Company and, until the effective date of the merger between The Gillette Company and The Procter  Gamble Company, non-employee members of the Gillette Board of Directors. Under the plan, eligible participants are: (i) granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii) granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii) granted shares of the Company's common stock or restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents). Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company's capitalization and the addition of any shares authorized but not issued or redeemed under The Gillette Company 1971 Stock Option Plan, the number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 19 million shares. Except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights must expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan must be equal to or greater than the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of grant. Any common stock awarded under the plan may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the committee administering the plan may determine. If a recipient of a grant leaves the Company while holding an unexercised option or right: (1) any unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement, special separation (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has waived the termination provisions; and (2) any exercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement, special separation, voluntary resignation that is not for Good Reason (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has waived the termination provisions.

Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the \"Company,\" \"PG,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" as used herein refer to The Procter  Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries. The Procter  Gamble Company is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world's consumers. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having been built from a business founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. Today, our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories. Throughout this Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains these reports at: www.sec.gov. You can also access these reports through links from our website at: www.pginvestor.com. Copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting EQ Shareowner Services, 1100 Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota, MN 55120-4100. Financial Information about Segments As of June 30, 2018 , the Company has five reportable segments under U.S. GAAP: Beauty ; Grooming ; Health Care ; Fabric  Home Care and Baby, Feminine  Family Care . Many of the factors necessary for understanding these businesses are similar. Operating margins of the individual businesses vary due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products, the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. Net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets and product categories in which they operate. While none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components within certain reportable segments, such as Appliances (Grooming) and Personal Health Care (Health), are seasonal. Additional information about our reportable segments can be found in the MDA and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Narrative Description of Business Business Model . Our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products, as well as the creation of new innovative products. The markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e- commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. Our growth strategy is to deliver meaningful and noticeable superiority in all elements of our consumer proposition - product, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value equation. We use our research and development and consumer insights to provide superior products and packaging. We utilize our marketing and online presence to deliver superior brand messaging to our consumers. We work collaboratively with our customers to deliver superior retail execution, both in-store and online. In conjunction with the above elements, we provide superior value to consumers and our retail customers, in each price tier where we compete. Key Product Categories . Information on key product categories can be found in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Key Customers . Our customers include mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. Sales to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 15% of our total sales in 2018 , 16% in 2017 and 15% in 2016 . No other customer represents more than 10% of our total sales. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 36% of our total sales in 2018 and 35% in both 2017 and 2016 . The nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government. We believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete. Sources and Availability of Materials . Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from others, some of whom are single-source suppliers. We produce certain raw materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing process and in the transportation of input materials and finished products to customers. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers. The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, none of which is material to our business taken as a whole. Trademarks and Patents . We own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks, which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. All major trademarks in each business are registered. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses. 2 The Procter  Gamble Company Competitive Condition . The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. We support our products with advertising, promotions and other marketing vehicles to build awareness and trial of our brands and products in conjunction with our sales force. We believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products. Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important differentiating factors. Research and Development Expenditures . Research and development (RD) expenditures enable us to develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of our consumers. Research and development expenses were $1.9 billion in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 (reported in Net earnings from continuing operations). Expenditures for Environmental Compliance . Expenditures for compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not material to the Company. No material change is expected in fiscal year 2019 . Employees . Total number of employees is an estimate of total Company employees excluding interns, co-ops, contractors and employees of joint ventures as of the years ended June 30. The number of employees includes manufacturing and non-manufacturing employees. The number of employees is not restated to exclude employees of discontinued operations. ##TABLE_START  Total Number of Employees 92,000 95,000 105,000 110,000 118,000 121,000 ##TABLE_ENDFinancial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations. Net sales in the United States account for 41% of total net sales. No other individual country exceeds 10% of total net sales.

Risk Factors. We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-K, quarterly and annual reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. The following discussion of risk factors identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with the MDA and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes incorporated in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. The Procter  Gamble Company 3 Our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility. We are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world. We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our operations outside the U.S. generate a significant portion of our net revenue. Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in U.S. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition. Moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries, including potential changes to tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could adversely affect our results. See also the Results of Operations and Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity sections of the MDA and Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls or restrictions, such as Nigeria, Algeria and Egypt. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business. Additionally, our business, operations or employees may be adversely affected by political volatility, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval, broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments, particularly in emerging markets. Uncertain global economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, which could adversely impact our business. Our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic disruptions, such as: a slow-down in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers; a significant shift in government policies; or the inability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. Additionally, economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third-party partners to suffer financial difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles. In addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient income and cash flow, it could affect the Companys ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments. Disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit. A disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. Disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results. Our ability to meet our customers needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. The loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity in our internal information and data systems, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials, significant changes in trade policy, natural disasters, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise, acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare. Therefore, our business results are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our financial results. Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits . We are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. Achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. The success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. We 4 The Procter  Gamble Company must also successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors. Failure to continually innovate, improve and respond to competitive moves and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels. The consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online and growth in hard discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile commerce applications, could negatively impact our results. A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level or shelf space of our products as a result of increased offerings of private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption. If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. The Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients or environmental impacts, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer. Our Company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, diversity and inclusion, gender equality and environmental sustainability. If these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, the Company's reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. Due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, for certain functions. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our financial results could suffer. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. An information security or operational technology incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems, networks, hardware, processes, and/or associated sites owned or operated by the Company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. As part of the Companys regular review of potential risks, we maintain an information and operational technology (IT/OT) risk management program that is primarily supervised by information technology management and reviewed by internal cross-functional stakeholders. As part of this program, analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats as well as the Companys plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management, the Audit The Procter  Gamble Company 5 Committee and the Board of Directors. Despite our policies, procedures and programs, including this IT/OT risk management program, we may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to which we are exposed. We rely extensively on IT/OT systems, networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and technologies, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. The various uses of these IT/OT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: ##TABLE_START  ordering and managing materials from suppliers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  converting materials to finished products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  shipping products to customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  marketing and selling products to consumers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  collecting, transferring, storing and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data, including such data from citizens of the European Union who are covered by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  providing data security; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  handling other processes necessary to manage our business. ##TABLE_END Numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks and supply chain, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations. As cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally, the Company is continually increasing its attention to these threats. We assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments seeking to address them, including ongoing monitoring and updating of networks and systems, increasing specialized information security skills, deploying employee security training, and updating security policies for the Company and its third-party providers. However, because the techniques, tools and tactics used in cyber attacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack. Our IT/OT databases and systems and our third-party providers databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and other cyber-attacks. Such attacks may originate from nation states or attempts by outside parties, hackers, criminal organizations or other threat actors. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks; however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party providers will prevent material breaches, operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our third-party providers IT/OT databases or systems. Periodically, we also need to upgrade our IT/OT systems or adopt new technologies. If such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures, it could affect our ability to order materials, make and ship orders, and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues. Further, if the IT/OT systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations, or inadvertent disclosure of, lack of integrity of, or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling, security incidents or employee error or malfeasance, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. The costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results. Changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results. Changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, the United Kingdoms decision to leave the European Union has created uncertainty regarding, among other things, the U.K.'s future legal and economic framework and how the U.K. will interact with other countries, including with respect to the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. In addition, results of elections, referendums or other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured, sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, taxes, the movement of goods, services, capital and people between countries and other matters. The potential implications of such uncertainty, which include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations, trade barriers and market contraction, could adversely affect the Companys business and financial results. We must successfully manage compliance with laws and regulations, as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the U.S. and abroad. Our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across all of the countries in which we do business, including 6 The Procter  Gamble Company those laws and regulations involving intellectual property, product liability, marketing, antitrust, data protection, environmental (including climate, water, waste), employment, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, tax, accounting and financial reporting or other matters. Rapidly changing laws, regulations and related interpretations, as well as increased enforcement actions, create challenges for the Company, including our compliance and ethics programs, and may alter the environment in which we do business, which could adversely impact our financial results. If we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. Failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. Furthermore, if pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results. The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the various tax laws can and do occur. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the U.S. Tax Act). The changes included in the U.S. Tax Act are broad and complex. The final transition impacts of the U.S. Tax Act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the U.S. Tax Act, any regulatory guidance or legislative action to address questions that arise because of the U.S. Tax Act or any updates or changes to estimates the Company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts, including impacts from changes to current year earnings estimates. Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each countrys jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving as a result of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting reporting requirements (BEPS\") recommended by the G8, G20 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\"OECD\"). As these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results. Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities. While we believe our tax positions will be sustained, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 Beauty Brands transaction with Coty, may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements, which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results. We must successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures such as the termination of the PGT Healthcare partnership between the Company and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Our financial results could also be impacted by acquisitions or joint venture activities, such as the planned acquisition of Merck KGaA's Consumer Health business, if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets. Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change. Our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings, including staffing adjustments as well as employee departures. Failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings, while continuing to invest in business growth, could adversely impact our financial results. Additionally, successfully executing organizational change, including management transitions at leadership levels of the Company and motivation and retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers and availability of qualified personnel. Our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense, as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Management's Discussion and Analysis Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including without limitation, the following sections: Management's Discussion and Analysis and Risk Factors. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believe, project, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, strategy, future, opportunity, plan, may, should, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein is included, without limitation, in the section titled \"Economic Conditions and Uncertainties\" and the section titled Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MDA) is to provide an understanding of Procter  Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MDA is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The MDA is organized in the following sections: ##TABLE_START  Overview ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Summary of 2018 Results ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Economic Conditions and Uncertainties ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Results of Operations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Segment Results ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Information ##TABLE_END Throughout the MDA we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign exchange and India Goods and Services tax changes from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and certain divestiture impacts. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of the MDA provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MDA are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal-year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. OVERVIEW PG is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products, as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. The Procter  Gamble Company 13 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE Our organizational structure is comprised of Global Business Units (GBUs), Selling and Market Operations (SMOs), Global Business Services (GBS) and Corporate Functions (CF). Global Business Units Our GBUs are organized into ten product categories. Under U.S. GAAP, the GBUs underlying the ten product categories are aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty ; Grooming ; Health Care ; Fabric  Home Care ; and Baby, Feminine  Family Care . The GBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the ten product categories and brand composition within each segment. ##TABLE_START Reportable Segments % of Net Sales (1) % of Net Earnings (1) Product Categories (Sub-Categories) Major Brands Beauty 19% 23% Hair Care ( Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments ) Head  Shoulders, Pantene, Rejoice Skin and Personal Care ( Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care ) Olay, Old Spice, Safeguard, SK-II Grooming 10% 14% Grooming  (2) (Shave Care - Female Blades  Razors, Male Blades  Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care; Appliances) Braun, Fusion, Gillette, Mach3, Prestobarba, Venus Health Care 12% 13% Oral Care ( Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care ) Crest, Oral-B Personal Health Care ( Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care ) Metamucil, Prilosec, Vicks Fabric  Home Care 32% 27% Fabric Care ( Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents ) Ariel, Downy, Gain, Tide Home Care ( Air Care, Dish Care, PG Professional, Surface Care ) Cascade, Dawn, Febreze, Mr. Clean, Swiffer Baby, Feminine  Family Care 27% 23% Baby Care ( Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants ) Luvs, Pampers Feminine Care ( Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care ) Always, Tampax Family Care ( Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper ) Bounty, Charmin, Puffs ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Percent of Net sales and Net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2018 (excluding results held in Corporate). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The Grooming product category is comprised of the Shave Care and Appliances GBUs.  ##TABLE_END Recent Developments: During fiscal 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire the over the counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA for 3.375 billion ($3.9 billion based on current exchange rates). This business primarily sells OTC consumer healthcare products, mainly in Europe, Latin America and Asia markets. Total sales for the business during its most recent fiscal year were approximately $1 billion. We anticipate the transaction to close during fiscal 2019, with the timing subject to regulatory clearance and customary closing conditions. The Company also reached an agreement during fiscal 2018 to dissolve our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business. Pursuant to the agreement, PGT product assets will return to the original respective parent companies to reestablish independent OTC businesses. This transaction was completed in July 2018 and will be accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the PGT business. The Company expects to record an after-tax gain on the sale of approximately $285 million. During fiscal 2017, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories, which included 43 of the Company's beauty brands (\"Beauty Brands\"), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and the fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. The Beauty Brands had historically been part of the Companys Beauty reportable segment. The results of the Beauty Brands are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. During fiscal 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business. The Batteries business had historically been part of the Companys Fabric  Home Care reportable segment. The results of the Batteries business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. As a result of these divestitures, the Company's portfolio is comprised of 10 category-based businesses where PG has 14 The Procter  Gamble Company leading market positions, strong brands and consumer meaningful product technologies. Refer to Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on each of these divestiture transactions. Beauty : We are a global market leader in the beauty category.

Volume increased low single digits in Beauty, Health Care and Fabric  Home Care and was unchanged in Grooming. Volume decreased low single digits in Baby, Feminine  Family Care. Excluding the impact of minor brand divestitures, organic volume increased mid-single digits in Fabric  Home Care. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net earnings from continuing operations decreased $333 million or 3% in fiscal 2018, due primarily to the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Act). Please refer to Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on tax impacts. Operating income decreased 2% due to reduced margins, partially offset by net sales growth. This was largely offset by an increase in Other non-operating income/(expense), net, due to higher costs of early extinguishment of debt in the base period. Favorable foreign exchange impacts increased net earnings from continuing operations by approximately $125 million or 1%. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net earnings from discontinued operations were zero in fiscal 2018 compared to $5.2 billion in fiscal 2017 ##TABLE_ENDprimarily due to the net impact of a gain on the sale of our Beauty Brands business. ##TABLE_START  Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble were $9.8 billion , a decrease of $5.6 billion or 36% versus the prior year primarily due to the aforementioned reduction in net earnings from discontinued operations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted net earnings per share decreased 34% to $3.67 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 1% to $3.67 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Core EPS increased 8% to $4.22 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash flow from operating activities was $14.9 billion . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adjusted free cash flow was $11.2 billion . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 104% . ##TABLE_END16 The Procter  Gamble Company ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are \"forward-looking statements\" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. Global Economic Conditions. Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest in the Middle East, Central  Eastern Europe and the Korean peninsula, economic uncertainty related to the execution of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American markets and overall economic slowdowns, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings. Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. If we are unable to manage commodity and other cost fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings. Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. As discussed later in this MDA, we initiated certain non-manufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvement projects in 2012. In fiscal 2017, we communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year cost reduction program which is resulting in enrollment reductions and other savings. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings. Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Over previous fiscal years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Egypt, Russia, Turkey and the United Kingdom have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales and profits. Government Policies. Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies, for example, the U.S. Tax Act enacted in December 2017, the implications and uncertainties of which are disclosed elsewhere in this report. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria and Egypt. Further, our earnings and sales could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including potential increases of import tariffs. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings. For information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SGA), other non-operating items and income taxes. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives and other activities by competitors), marketing spending and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the U.S. Most of our cost of products sold and SGA are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the The Procter  Gamble Company 17 underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SGA are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. Overhead costs are also variable in nature, but on a relative basis, less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth. Accordingly, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs. The Company is in the midst of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. The plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. Net Sales Fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 Net sales increased 3% to $66.8 billion in 2018 on a 1% increase in unit volume versus the prior year. Volume increased low single digits in Beauty, Health Care and Fabric  Home Care and was unchanged in Grooming. Volume decreased low single digits in Baby, Feminine and Family Care. Excluding the impact of minor brand divestitures, Fabric  Home Care organic volume increased mid-single digits. Volume increased low single digits in developed and developing regions. Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales by 2%. Pricing had a negative 1% impact on net sales. Product mix had a positive 1% impact on net sales primarily due to a disproportionate growth in super-premium brands. Organic sales grew 1% driven by a 2% increase in organic volume. Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Net sales were unchanged at $65.1 billion in 2017 on a 1% increase in unit volume versus the prior year period. Volume increased low single digits in Grooming, Health Care, Fabric  Home Care and Baby, Feminine  Family Care. Volume decreased low single digits in Beauty. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and was unchanged in developing regions. Organic volume increased low single digits in both developed and developing markets. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Neither pricing nor mix had any net impact on net sales for the year. Organic sales grew 2% driven by a 2% increase in organic volume.

Gross margin benefited 200 basis points from total manufacturing cost savings (170 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments). This was more than offset by: ##TABLE_START  a 90 basis-point negative impact due to higher commodity costs, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 50 basis-point decline due to reduced pricing, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 100 basis-point decline from unfavorable product mix (within segments due to the disproportionate growth of lower margin product forms, large sizes and club channels and between segments caused by the disproportionate volume growth in Fabric  Home Care, which has lower than company-average gross margins), ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 30 basis-point negative impact from higher restructuring charges and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 30 basis-point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. ##TABLE_ENDTotal SGA increased 2% to $18.9 billion driven by increased overhead and marketing spending, as well as an increase in other net operating expenses, primarily due to higher gains on real estate sales in the base period. SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 28.2% . Reductions in marketing and overhead spending as a percentage of net sales were partially offset by an increase in other net operating expenses. ##TABLE_START  Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points, primarily driven by reductions in agency compensation and production costs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points, primarily driven by productivity savings and sales growth leverage, partially offset by higher restructuring costs versus the base year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points primarily due to gains on the sale of real estate in the base year. ##TABLE_END18 The Procter  Gamble Company Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Gross margin increased 40 basis points (bps) to 50.0% of net sales in 2017 . Gross margin increased primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  a 230 basis-point positive impact from total manufacturing cost savings (210 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments), ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 20 basis-point benefit from lower restructuring charges and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 10 basis-point benefit from positive scale impacts due to higher volume. ##TABLE_END These impacts were partially offset by: ##TABLE_START  a 90 basis-point decrease from unfavorable product mix between segments (caused primarily by the lower relative proportion of sales in Grooming, which has higher than company-average gross margins) and within segments (due to disproportionate growth of lower margin products, forms and package sizes in certain businesses), ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 40 basis-point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a combined 70 basis-point impact due to higher commodities and other costs. ##TABLE_END Total SGA decreased 2% to $18.6 billion as increased overhead and advertising spending were more than offset by a reduction in other operating expenses, primarily due to a reduction in net foreign exchange transactional costs and gains on real estate sales. SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points to 28.5% as a result of the decline in other operating expenses. ##TABLE_START  Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points due to an increase in marketing activities, partially offset by productivity savings. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points, primarily driven by wage inflation and increased sales personnel in certain businesses, partially offset by 20 basis points of productivity savings. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other operating expenses as a percent of net sales declined 80 basis points. Lower foreign exchange transactional charges reduced SGA as a percentage of net sales by ##TABLE_END approximately 20 basis points. The balance of the reduction is primarily driven by gains on sales of real estate. Non-Operating Items Fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 ##TABLE_START  Interest expense was $506 million in 2018 , an increase of $41 million versus the prior year due to an increase in average long term debt balances and an increase in U.S. interest rates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interest income was $247 million in 2018 , an increase of $76 million versus the prior year primarily due to an increase in average balances of interest bearing cash and cash equivalents and investment securities balances and an increase in U.S. interest rates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other non-operating income/(expense), which consists primarily of divestiture gains, investment income and other non-operating items was a net expense of $126 million in 2018, an improvement of $278 million versus ##TABLE_ENDthe prior year primarily due to lower charges for the early extinguishment of debt (which totaled $346 million in the current year and $543 million in the base year) and an increase in minor brand divestiture gains. In the current year we had approximately $190 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Swisse, Bold and other minor brands. In 2017, we had approximately $110 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Hipoglos and other minor brands. Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 ##TABLE_START  Interest expense was $465 million in 2017 , a decrease of $114 million versus the prior year due to a decrease in weighted average interest rates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interest income was $171 million in 2017 , comparable to 2016. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other non-operating income/(expense), which consists primarily of divestiture gains, investment income and other non-operating items, was a net expense of $404 million in 2017 versus a net income of $325 million in 2016, a $729 million year-over-year decrease. This change is due to a $543 million current-year charge related to early extinguishment of long-term debt and a reduction in gains on minor brand divestitures. In 2017 , we had approximately $110 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Hipoglos (a baby care brand sold primarily in Brazil) and other minor brands. The prior year divestiture activities included approximately $300 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Escudo and certain hair care brands in Europe and IMEA. ##TABLE_END Income Taxes Fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 290 basis points to 26.0% in 2018. A net transitional charge of $602 million resulting from the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act caused a 450 basis-point increase in the current period rate (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). The remaining net decrease of 160 basis points in the effective rate was driven by: ##TABLE_START  a 280 basis-point year over year reduction from the ongoing impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, as the impact of the lower blended U.S. federal rate on current year earnings versus prior year rate was partially offset by reduced foreign tax credits versus prior year due to the inability to fully credit foreign taxes under the U.S. Tax Act, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 170 basis-point reduction from favorable geographic mix of earnings, primarily due to a greater proportion of income in lower tax foreign jurisdictions, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 180 basis-point increase from reduced favorable discrete impacts related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to approximately 25 basis points in the current year versus 205 basis points in the prior year), ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 70 basis-point increase from reduced excess tax benefits from share-based compensation (60 basis points in the current year versus 130 basis points in the prior year) and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 40 basis-point unfavorable impact due to reduced benefits from the tax impacts of early extinguishment of long-term debt (10 basis-point benefit in current year versus 50 basis-point benefit in the prior year). ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company 19 Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 190 basis points to 23.1%. The rate declined due to: ##TABLE_START  a 130 basis-point impact from excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments due to the adoption of FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting in 2017, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 150 basis-point benefit from discrete impacts related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to approximately 205 basis points in the current year versus 55 basis points in the prior year), ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 50 basis-point benefit from the tax impact of the early extinguishment of long-term debt and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 130 basis-point benefit from the prior year establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards. ##TABLE_END These benefits were partially offset by a 230 basis-point increase from unfavorable geographic mix, primarily due to a greater proportion of total income taxed in the U.S. and a 40 basis-point increase due to the impact of minor brand divestitures. Net Earnings Fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 Net earnings from continuing operations decreased 3% to $9.9 billion . Operating income decreased $244 million , or 2%, as the increase in net sales and decrease in SGA as a percentage of net sales were more than offset by the reduction in gross margin. The increase in net non-operating income/(expense) discussed above benefited net earnings. Net earnings from continuing operations before taxes increased 1%. Increased income tax expense negatively impacted net earnings from continuing operations by approximately 4% due largely to the net charge for the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act in 2018. Foreign exchange had a positive impact of $125 million on net earnings in 2018 due to strengthening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar, including those in the United Kingdom, China, Canada and Russia. This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings from discontinued operations were zero in 2018. Net earnings from discontinued operations were $5.2 billion in 2017, primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands which closed on October 1, 2016 (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble decreased $5.6 billion , or 36% , to $9.8 billion . The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in net earnings from discontinued operations. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations declined $0.02 , or 1% , to $3.67 due primarily to the reduction in net earnings from continuing operations, partially offset by a reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations were zero in 2018, and were $1.90 per share in the prior year due to the gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands in 2017. Diluted net earnings per share decreased $1.92 , or 34% , to $3.67 . Core EPS increased 8% to $4.22 . Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the current year net charge for the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act and the charges in both periods for early extinguishment of debt and incremental restructuring charges related to our productivity and cost savings plans. The increase was driven by increased sales, the lower effective tax rate on core earnings (excluding the transitional net tax charge from the U.S. Tax Act) and the reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding discussed above. Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Net earnings from continuing operations increased $167 million, or 2%, to $10.2 billion. Operating income improved $514 million, or 4%, due to improved gross margin and reduced SGA costs. Net earnings also benefitted from a lower tax rate in 2017. These benefits were partially offset by the increase in net non-operating expenses, discussed above. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $420 million in 2017 due to weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar, including those in Argentina, Nigeria, Egypt and the United Kingdom. This impact includes both transactional charges as discussed above in Operating Costs and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $4.6 billion in 2017 to $5.2 billion. This change was driven by the $5.3 billion gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands in the current year, partially offset by the impact of the base period results, which included the net earnings of the Batteries and Beauty Brands businesses prior to divestiture, a gain on the sale of the Batteries business and impairment charges on the Batteries business prior to divestiture (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble increased $4.8 billion, or 46%, to $15.3 billion. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.20, or 6%, to $3.69 due to the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and a reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding following the shares tendered in the sale of the Beauty Brands to Coty (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), along with ongoing share repurchases. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations were $1.90. This was an increase of $1.70 per share versus the prior year primarily resulting from the gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands. Diluted net earnings per share increased $1.90, or 51%, to $5.59. Core EPS increased 7% to $3.92. Core EPS in fiscal year 2017 represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the charge related to early extinguishment of long-term debt and incremental restructuring charges related to our productivity and cost savings plan. The increase was driven by operating margin expansion, lower effective tax rate and the reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding discussed above. 20 The Procter  Gamble Company SEGMENT RESULTS Segment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation.

Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item is income taxes, to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. For 2018, the tax impact also includes the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, which were included in the corporate segment. Fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 Corporate net sales decreased 2% to $497 million in 2018 due to a decrease in the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings/(loss) from continuing operations decreased by $380 million in 2018, primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  an increase in income tax expense in 2018 caused by the aforementioned $602 million net charge for the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  an increase in after-tax restructuring charges of approximately $331 million. ##TABLE_END These costs were partially offset by lower charges related to the early extinguishment of long-term debt in 2018 versus 2017, the lower tax rate on current year earnings as a result of the U.S. Tax Act and an increase in the proportion of corporate overhead spending allocated to the segments. Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Corporate net sales increased 20%, or $83 million, to $505 million in 2017 primarily due to an increase in the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level.

Restructuring Program to deliver Productivity and Cost Savings In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings program. The current productivity and cost savings plan will further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. As part of this plan, the Company incurred approximately $1.1 billion in total before- tax restructuring costs in fiscal 2018, with an additional amount of approximately $0.8 billion expected in fiscal 2019. This program is expected to result in additional enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Savings generated from restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of The Procter  Gamble Company 25 reinvestment. However, we estimate that through 2018, the underlying restructuring costs and other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions since 2012 have delivered approximately $3.3 billion in annual before-tax gross savings. Restructuring accruals of $513 million as of June 30, 2018 are classified as current liabilities. Approximately 65% of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2018 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program and to the Operating Costs section of the MDA for more information about the total benefit to operating margins from our total savings efforts. CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations. Operating Cash Flow Fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 Operating cash flow was $ 14.9 billion in 2018 , a 17% increase from the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets) generated $11.4 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts generated $3.5 billion of operating cash flow as summarized below. ##TABLE_START  An increase in accounts receivable used $177 million of cash due to increased sales and the timing of the year-end (which fell on a weekend, resulting in fewer days collection). The number of days sales outstanding remained flat versus prior year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Higher inventory used $188 million of cash mainly due to inventory increases to support initiatives and business growth across all segments. Inventory days on hand decreased approximately 1 day primarily due to foreign exchange impacts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $1.4 billion of cash. This was primarily driven by extended payment terms with our suppliers and an increase in fourth quarter marketing activity versus the prior year. These factors, along with offsetting impacts of foreign exchange, drove a 2 day increase in days payable outstanding. Although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics, we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers could decline slightly over the next fiscal year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other operating assets and liabilities generated $2.0 billion of cash, primarily driven by the long-term portion of the payable related to the U.S. Tax Act repatriation charge. ##TABLE_END Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Operating cash flow was $12.8 billion in 2017 , a 17% decrease from the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes, loss/(gain) on sale of assets and impairment charges) and the loss on early extinguishment of debt generated $13.0 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $281 million of operating cash flow. ##TABLE_START  An increase in accounts receivable used $322 million of cash due to higher relative sales late in the period as compared to the prior period, partially offset by collection of approximately $150 million of retained receivables from the Beauty Brands business. In addition, the number of days sales outstanding increased 1 day due in part to foreign exchange impacts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Lower inventory generated $71 million of cash mainly due to supply chain optimizations, partially offset by increases to support business growth and increased commodity costs. Inventory days on hand decreased approximately 1 day primarily due to supply chain optimizations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities decreased, using $149 million in operating cash flow. This was caused by reduced accruals from lower fourth quarter marketing and overhead activities as compared to the base period, as well as the payment of approximately $595 million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to the divestiture of the Beauty Brands business, including liabilities retained by the Company pursuant to the terms of the agreement. These impacts were partially offset by approximately $700 million related to extended payment terms with our suppliers. These factors, along with the impact of foreign exchange, drove a 4 day increase in days payable outstanding. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other operating assets and liabilities used $43 million of cash. ##TABLE_END Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding tax payments related to certain divestitures and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. 26 The Procter  Gamble Company Fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 Adjusted free cash flow was $11.2 billion in 2018 , an increase of 14% versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating cash flows as discussed above. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, excluding the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act and the loss on early extinguishment of debt, was 104% in 2018 . Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Adjusted free cash flow was $9.8 billion in 2017 , a decrease of 19% versus the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in operating cash flows. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, excluding the loss on debt extinguishment and impacts of the sale of the Beauty Brands, was 94% in 2017 . Investing Cash Flow Fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 Net investing activities consumed $3.5 billion in cash in 2018 mainly due to capital spending and purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales and sales and maturities of short-term investments. Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Net investing activities consumed $5.7 billion in cash in 2017 mainly due to capital spending and purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales, transactions related to the close of the Beauty Brands divestiture and sales and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.7 billion in 2018 and $3.4 billion in 2017 . Capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points to 5.6% in 2018 . Capital spending as a percentage of net sales was 5.2% in 2017 . Acquisitions. Acquisition activity used cash of $109 million in 2018 , primarily related to acquisitions in the Beauty segment. Acquisition activity was not material in 2017 . Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales in 2018 contributed $269 million in cash, primarily from minor brand divestitures. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $571 million in cash in 2017 primarily from real estate sales and other minor brand divestitures. In fiscal 2017, the Company invested an additional $874 million of cash, received from the issuance of debt, in restricted cash. At the closing of the Beauty Brands transaction, $1.9 billion of restricted cash (including the $874 million invested in 2017) was released and returned to cash and cash equivalents and $475 million of cash was transferred to the discontinued Beauty Brands business. Financing Cash Flow Dividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 3.3% to $2.79 per share in 2018 . Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $7.3 billion in 2018 and $7.2 billion in 2017 . In April 2018, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.6896 to $0.7172 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This represents a 4% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 62nd consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend for 128 years, every year since our incorporation in 1890. Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $31.3 billion as of June 30, 2018 and $31.6 billion as of June 30, 2017 . Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $7.0 billion in 2018 and $5.2 billion in 2017 . Liquidity At June 30, 2018 , our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $4.9 billion, largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2018 , $11.4 billion of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was held off-shore by foreign subsidiaries. This balance has declined versus the prior year primarily due to cash repatriations following the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act. Under current law, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. Of the June 30, 2018 balance of off-shore cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the majority relates to various Western European countries. As of June 30, 2018 , we did not have material cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds. We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. On June 30, 2018 , our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard  Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard  Poor's), all with a stable outlook. We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2022 and November 2018, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms The Procter  Gamble Company 27 of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. For additional details on debt see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity. Contractual Commitments The following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2018 . ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions Total  Less Than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  After 5 Years RECORDED LIABILITIES          Total debt $ 31,217  $ 10,407  $ 4,630  $ 5,224  $ 10,956 Capital leases     U.S. Tax Act transitional charge (1) 2,884     1,730 Uncertain tax positions (2)          OTHER          Interest payments relating to long-term debt 4,944   1,033   2,526 Operating leases (3) 1,338     Minimum pension funding (4)       Purchase obligations (5) 1,129     TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS $ 42,021  $ 12,418  $ 7,039  $ 6,891  $ 15,673 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Represents the U.S. federal tax liability associated with the repatriation provisions of the U.S. Tax Act. Does not include any provisions made for foreign withholding taxes on expected repatriations as the timing of those payments is uncertain. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  As of June 30, 2018 , the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $584 million, including $114 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2018 , cannot be made. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2020 are not currently determinable. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent minimum commitments under take-or-pay agreements with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. Such amounts also include arrangements with suppliers that qualify as embedded operating leases. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position. ##TABLE_END SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned. For us, this generally means revenue is recognized when title to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. Trade promotions, 28 The Procter  Gamble Company consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities, and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred, generally at the time of the sale. Amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on contractual terms, customer performance, sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates. The actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates. These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers on July 1, 2018. Adoption of this standard will result in a change in the timing of recognition of certain trade promotional spending. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions. Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized. We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. A core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities. However, because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border transactions. We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty. We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. For additional details on the Company's income taxes, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Employee Benefits We sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits. The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2018 , the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets was 6.8% and 8.3%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $115 million. Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined The Procter  Gamble Company 29 benefit pension plans of 2.5% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $190 million. The average discount rate on the OPEB plan of 4.2% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where a majority of the plan participants receive benefits. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $65 million. For additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations. We typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the income method, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. The valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin progression, Company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows. Indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized, but are tested separately at least annually for impairment. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. For example, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. In addition, changes to, or a failure to achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates, leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses. We test individual indefinite lived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets. The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two step process. In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. The second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination. If the resulting implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, all customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high. Both of these wholly-acquired reporting units have fair value cushions (the fair values currently exceed the underlying carrying values). However, the overall Shave Care cushion, as well as the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset cushion, have both been reduced to below 10% , both due in large part to an increased competitive market environment, a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits and significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar that have occurred in recent years, and which has contributed to reduced cash flow projections. As a result, this reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset are more susceptible to impairment risk. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the residual net sales and earnings growth rates and discount rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the 10-year time horizon. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans, and approximates expected long term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is 30 The Procter  Gamble Company consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar and changes in expected rates of inflation. While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, significant changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of the business unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. As of June 30, 2018 , the carrying values of Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are $19.5 billion and $15.7 billion , respectively. The table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite lived intangible asset, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the residual net sales growth rate and the discount rate, to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 50 basis point decrease to our residual net sales growth rate or a 50 basis point increase to our discount rate. Given the size of the fair value cushions, changes in the assumptions of this magnitude would result in an impairment of the underlying goodwill and could result in an impairment of the indefinite lived intangible asset. ##TABLE_START  Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value  +50 bps Discount Rate  -50 bps Residual Growth Shave Care goodwill reporting unit (10)%  (7)% Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset (10)%  (7)% ##TABLE_ENDSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing results. New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of June 30, 2018 . OTHER INFORMATION Hedging and Derivative Financial Instruments As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. Except within financing operations, we leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the RiskManager value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics dataset as of June 30, 2018 . In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics, a reasonable proxy is included. Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term. Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments. Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2018 , including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements. Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months. In addition, we have entered into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions. Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2018 , we The Procter  Gamble Company 31 believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements. Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures. As of and during the years ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 , we did not have any commodity hedging activity. Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e. trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. These measures include: Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of the India Goods  Services Tax changes, the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis, and this measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth: ##TABLE_START Year ended June 30, 2018 Net Sales Growth Foreign Exchange Impact Acquisition  Divestiture Impact/Other (1) Organic Sales Growth Beauty % (2 )%  % % Grooming (1 )% (3 )% % (3 )% Health Care % (3 )%  % % Fabric  Home Care % (1 )% % % Baby, Feminine  Family Care (1 )% (1 )%  % (2 )% TOTAL COMPANY % (2 )%  % %      Year ended June 30, 2017 Net Sales Growth Foreign Exchange Impact Acquisition  Divestiture Impact/Other (2) Organic Sales Growth Beauty  % % % % Grooming (3 )% % %  % Health Care % % % % Fabric  Home Care  % % % % Baby, Feminine  Family Care (1 )% %  % % TOTAL COMPANY  % %  % % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Acquisition  Divestiture Impact/Other includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the impact of the India Goods and Services Tax implementation and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Acquisition  Divestiture Impact/Other includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. ##TABLE_END Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding certain divestiture impacts (tax payments related to certain divestitures). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions): ##TABLE_START  Operating Cash Flow Capital Spending Divestiture impacts (1) Adjusted Free Cash Flow $ 14,867 $ (3,717 ) $  $ 11,150 12,753 (3,384 ) 9,787 15,435 (3,314 )  12,121 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Divestiture impacts relate to tax payments for the Beauty Brands divestiture in fiscal 2017. ##TABLE_END32 The Procter  Gamble Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act, the losses on early debt extinguishment, the gain on the sale of the Batteries and Beauty Brands businesses and Batteries impairments. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand PGs ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions): ##TABLE_START  Net Earnings Adjustments to Net Earnings (1) Net Earnings Excluding Adjustments Adjusted Free Cash Flow Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity $ 9,861 $ $ 10,706 $ 11,150 % 15,411 (4,990 ) 10,421 9,787 % 10,604 (72 ) 10,532 12,121 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Adjustments to Net Earnings relate to the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act in fiscal 2018, the losses on early debt extinguishment in fiscal 2018 and 2017, the gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands business in 2017, and the gain on the sale of the Batteries business and the Batteries impairment in fiscal 2016. ##TABLE_ENDCore EPS. Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. The table below provides a reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS, including the following reconciling items: ##TABLE_START  Incremental Restructuring : The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. In 2012, the Company began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities. In 2017, we communicated details of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Transitional Impacts of the U.S. Tax Act : As discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the U.S. Tax Act) in December 2017. This resulted in a net charge of $602 million for the fiscal year 2018. The adjustment to core earnings only includes this transitional impact. It does not include the ongoing impacts of the lower U.S. statutory rate on current year earnings. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Early debt extinguishment charges : In fiscal 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded after-tax charges of $243 million and $345 million, respectively, due to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. These charges represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Charges for certain European legal matters : Several countries in Europe issued separate complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in prior periods. In 2016, the Company incurred after-tax charges of $11 million to adjust legal reserves related to these matters. ##TABLE_END We do not view the above items to be indicative of underlying business results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of The Procter  Gamble Company (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Strong internal controls is an objective that is reinforced through our Worldwide Business Conduct Manual , which sets forth our commitment to conduct business with integrity, and within both the letter and the spirit of the law. Our people are deeply committed to our Purpose, Values, and Principles, which unite us in doing whats right. Our system of internal controls includes written policies and procedures, segregation of duties, and the careful selection and development of employees. Additional key elements of our internal control structure include our Global Leadership Council, which is actively involved in oversight of the business strategies, initiatives, results and controls, our Disclosure Committee, which is responsible for evaluating disclosure implications of significant business activities and events, our Board of Directors, which provides strong and effective corporate governance, and our Audit Committee, which reviews significant accounting policies, financial reporting and internal control matters. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes a Control Self-Assessment Program that is conducted annually for critical financial reporting areas of the Company and is audited by our Global Internal Audit organization. Management takes the appropriate action to correct any identified control deficiencies. Global Internal Audit also performs financial and compliance audits around the world, provides training, and continuously improves our internal control processes. Because of its inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, may not prevent or detect misstatements due to the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden or that misstatements due to error or fraud may occur that are not detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018 , using criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018 , based on these criteria. Deloitte  Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018 , as stated in their report which is included herein. ##TABLE_START /s/ David S.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 7, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. ##TABLE_START /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP Cincinnati, Ohio  August 7, 2018  We have served as the Companys auditor since 1890. ##TABLE_END36 The Procter  Gamble Company REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Procter  Gamble Company Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission(COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, of the Company and our report dated August 7, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. ##TABLE_START /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP Cincinnati, Ohio  August 7, 2018 ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company 37 Consolidated Statements of Earnings ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions except per share amounts; Years ended June 30   NET SALES $ 66,832  $ 65,058  $ 65,299 Cost of products sold 34,268  32,535  32,909 Selling, general and administrative expense 18,853  18,568  18,949 OPERATING INCOME 13,711  13,955  13,441 Interest expense   Interest income   Other non-operating income/(expense), net ( 126 )  ( 404 )  EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 13,326  13,257  13,369 Income taxes on continuing operations 3,465  3,063  3,342 NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS 9,861  10,194  10,027 NET EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS   5,217  NET EARNINGS 9,861  15,411  10,604 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests   NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER  GAMBLE $ 9,750  $ 15,326  $ 10,508       BASIC NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: (1)      Earnings from continuing operations $ 3.75  $ 3.79  $ 3.59 Earnings from discontinued operations   2.01  0.21 BASIC NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE $ 3.75  $ 5.80  $ 3.80 DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: (1)      Earnings from continuing operations $ 3.67  $ 3.69  $ 3.49 Earnings from discontinued operations   1.90  0.20 DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE $ 3.67  $ 5.59  $ 3.69 DIVIDENDS PER COMMON SHARE $ 2.79  $ 2.70  $ 2.66 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Basic net earnings per common share and Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble. ##TABLE_END See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 38 The Procter  Gamble Company Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions; Years ended June 30   NET EARNINGS $ 9,861  $ 15,411  $ 10,604 OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS), NET OF TAX      Financial statement foreign currency translation ( 6 )   ( 1,679 ) Unrealized gains/(losses) on hedges (net of $(279) , $(186) and $5 tax, respectively) ( 299 )  ( 306 )  Unrealized gains/(losses) on investment securities (net of $0 , $(6) and $7 tax, respectively) ( 148 )  ( 59 )  Unrealized gains/(losses) on defined benefit retirement plans (net of $68 , $551 and $(621) tax, respectively)  1,401  ( 1,477 ) TOTAL OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS), NET OF TAX ( 119 )  1,275  ( 3,127 ) TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME 9,742  16,686  7,477 Less: Total comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests   TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER  GAMBLE $ 9,633  $ 16,601  $ 7,381 ##TABLE_ENDSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated. Because of a lack of control over Venezuela subsidiaries caused by a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not consolidated for any year presented. We account for those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. Use of Estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, consumer and trade promotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, post-employment benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax positions and contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although management does not generally believe such differences would materially affect the financial statements in any individual year. However, in regard to ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those anticipated at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that materially affect the financial statements in a given year. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned. Revenue transactions represent sales of inventory. The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. The revenue includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to the customer. Our policy is to recognize revenue when title to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period the revenue is recognized. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred, generally at the time of the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in the Accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacturing of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product. Cost of products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense (SGA) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items. Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $ 1.9 billion in 2018 , $ 1.9 billion in 2017 and $ 1.9 billion in 2016 (reported in Net earnings from continuing operations). Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include worldwide television, print, radio, internet and in-store advertising expenses and were $ 7.1 billion in 2018 , $ 7.1 billion in 2017 and $ 7.2 billion in 2016 (reported in Net earnings from continuing operations). Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending reported in SGA include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids. Other Non-Operating Income/(Expense), Net Other non-operating income/(expense), net primarily includes net acquisition and divestiture gains, investment income and other non-operating items. Currency Translation Financial statements of operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in Other comprehensive income (OCI). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Re- Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 43 measurement adjustments for financial statements in highly inflationary economies and other transactional exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. Cash Flow Presentation The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method, which reconciles net earnings to cash flow from operating activities. Cash flows from foreign currency transactions and operations are translated at an average exchange rate for the period. Cash flows from hedging activities are included in the same category as the items being hedged. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as financing activities. Realized gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative instruments used to hedge currency exposures resulting from intercompany financing transactions are also classified as financing activities. Cash flows from other derivative instruments used to manage interest, commodity or other currency exposures are classified as operating activities. Cash payments related to income taxes are classified as operating activities. Cash flows from the Company's discontinued operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 13 for significant cash flow items related to discontinued operations. Investments Investment securities consist of readily marketable debt and equity securities. Unrealized gains or losses from investments classified as trading, if any, are charged to earnings. Unrealized gains or losses on securities classified as available-for-sale are generally recorded in OCI. If an available-for-sale security is other than temporarily impaired, the loss is charged to either earnings or OCI depending on our intent and ability to retain the security until we recover the full cost basis and the extent of the loss attributable to the creditworthiness of the issuer. Investment securities are included as Available-for-sale investment securities and Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Investments in certain companies over which we exert significant influence, but do not control the financial and operating decisions, are accounted for as equity method investments. Other investments that are not controlled, and over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method. Both equity and cost method investments are included as Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value. Product-related inventories are maintained on the first-in, first-out method. The cost of spare part inventories is maintained using the average-cost method. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized over the assets' estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Machinery and equipment includes office furniture and fixtures ( 15 -year life), computer equipment and capitalized software ( 3 - to 5 -year lives) and manufacturing equipment ( 3 - to 20 -year lives). Buildings are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 40 years. Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, when appropriate, changes are made prospectively. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. Our annual impairment testing of goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. We have acquired brands that have been determined to have indefinite lives. Those assets are evaluated annually for impairment. We evaluate a number of factors to determine whether an indefinite life is appropriate, including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. In addition, when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an additional impairment assessment is performed and indefinite-lived assets may be adjusted to a determinable life. The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology and other intangible assets with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives. Customer relationships, brands and other non-contractual intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over periods generally ranging from 5 to 30 years. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and remaining lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted. For additional details on goodwill and intangible assets see Note 4. Fair Values of Financial Instruments Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Changes in assumptions or estimation methods could affect the fair value estimates; however, we do not believe any such changes would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, certain investments and short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair values of long-term debt and financial instruments are disclosed in Note 9. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).\" This guidance outlines a single, comprehensive model of accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. We will adopt the standard on July 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 44 The Procter  Gamble Company product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single delivery element and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer. Accordingly, the timing of revenue recognition is not materially impacted by the new standard. The adoption of the new standard will impact the accrual timing for certain portions of our customer and consumer promotional spending, which will result in a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings of up to $ 350 , net of tax, on the date of adoption. The provisions of the new standard will also impact the classification of certain payments to customers, moving an immaterial amount of such payments (approximately $ 300 ) from expense to a deduction from net sales. This new guidance will not have any other material impacts on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including financial disclosures. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842).\" The standard requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements. We plan to adopt the standard on July 1, 2019. We are currently assessing the impact that the new standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which will consist primarily of a balance sheet gross up of our operating leases to show equal and offsetting lease assets and lease liabilities. For additional details on operating leases, see Note 12. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring a goodwill impairment to be measured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety. This eliminates the second step of the current impairment model that requires companies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit, and then measure impairments based on those fair values and a residual measurement approach. It also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We will adopt the standard no later than July 1, 2020. The impact of the new standard will be dependent on the specific facts and circumstances of future individual impairments, if any. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, \"Compensation-Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (Topic 715). This guidance requires an entity to disaggregate the current service cost component from the other components of net benefit costs in the face of the income statement. It requires the service cost component to be presented with other current compensation costs for the related employees in the operating section of the income statement. Other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented outside of income from operations. We will adopt the standard retrospectively on July 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2017-07 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We currently classify all net periodic pension costs within operating costs (as part of Cost of products sold and Selling, general and administrative expense). Had this standard been effective and adopted during fiscal 2018 , Cost of products sold and Selling, general and administrative costs would have increased approximately $ 164 and $ 184 , respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2018 with an offsetting change in Other non-operating income/(expense), net. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.\" This standard enables entities to better portray the economics of their risk management activities in the financial statements and enhances the transparency and understandability of hedge results through improved disclosures. The new standard is effective for us beginning July 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt the new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The amended presentation and disclosure guidance was applied on a prospective basis. The primary impact of adoption is the required disclosure changes. The adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the cumulative-effect adjustment required upon adoption. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOTE 2 SEGMENT INFORMATION During fiscal 2017, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories, comprised of 43 of its beauty brands. The transactions included the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and the fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. In fiscal 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business to Berkshire Hathaway. Each of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented (see Note 13). Under U.S. GAAP, our Global Business Units (GBUs) are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty , 2) Grooming , 3) Health Care , 4) Fabric  Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine  Family Care . Our five reportable segments are comprised of: ##TABLE_START  Beauty : Hair Care (Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Grooming : Shave Care (Female Blades  Razors, Male Blades  Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care); Appliances ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Health Care : Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fabric  Home Care : Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, PG Professional, Surface Care ); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Baby, Feminine  Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper). ##TABLE_END Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 45 The accounting policies of the segments are generally the same as those described in Note 1. Differences between these policies and U.S. GAAP primarily reflect income taxes, which are reflected in the segments using applicable blended statutory rates. Adjustments to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate, including the impacts from the U.S. Tax Act in fiscal 2018 (see Note 5). Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities that are not reflected in the operating results used internally to measure and evaluate the businesses, as well as items to adjust management reporting principles to U.S. GAAP. Operating activities in Corporate include the results of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Operating elements also include certain employee benefit costs, the costs of certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization, certain significant asset impairment charges and other general Corporate items. The non-operating elements in Corporate primarily include interest expense, certain acquisition and divestiture gains, interest and investing income and other financing costs. Total assets for the reportable segments include those assets managed by the reportable segment, primarily inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets. Other assets, primarily cash, accounts receivable, investment securities and goodwill, are included in Corporate. Our business units are comprised of similar product categories. Nine business units individually accounted for 5% or more of consolidated net sales as follows: ##TABLE_START % of Sales by Business Unit (1) Years ended June 30   Fabric Care 22 %  22 %  22 % Baby Care 13 %  14 %  14 % Hair Care 10 %  10 %  10 % Home Care 10 %  10 %  10 % Skin and Personal Care 9 %  8 %  8 % Shave Care 8 %  9 %  9 % Family Care 8 %  8 %  8 % Oral Care 8 %  8 %  8 % Feminine Care 6 %  6 %  6 % All Other 6 %  5 %  5 % TOTAL 100 %  100 %  100 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  % of sales by business unit excludes sales held in Corporate. ##TABLE_END The Company had net sales in the U.S. of $ 27.3 billion , $ 27.3 billion and $ 27.0 billion for the years ended June 30, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Long-lived assets in the U.S. totaled $ 9.7 billion and $ 8.8 billion as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Long-lived assets consists of property, plant and equipment. No other country's net sales or long-lived assets exceed 10% of the Company totals. Our largest customer, Walmart Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for consolidated net sales of approximately 15 % , 16 % and 15 % in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.

The Procter  Gamble Company 47 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $ 250 to $ 500 annually. In fiscal 2012, the Company initiated an incremental restructuring program (covering fiscal 2012 through 2017) as part of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing activities and overhead expenses. The productivity and cost savings plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the Company's growth strategy. Total restructuring costs incurred under the plan through fiscal 2017 was $ 5.6 billion , before tax. In fiscal 2017 the Company announced specific elements of another incremental multi-year productivity and cost savings plan to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. This program is expected to result in incremental enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs. The Company incurred total restructuring charges of $ 1,070 and $ 754 for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. An additional amount of approximately $ 800 is expected to be incurred in fiscal 2019. Of the charges incurred, $ 251 and $ 137 were recorded in SGA for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively and $ 819 and $ 593 were recorded in Cost of products sold for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The remainder of the charges for fiscal 2017 were included in Net earnings from discontinued operations. The following table presents restructuring activity for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 : ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions Separations Asset-Related Costs Other Total RESERVE JUNE 30, 2016 $ $  $ $ Charges 397 754 Cash spent (1) ( 221 )  ( 174 ) ( 395 ) Charges against assets  ( 397 )  ( 397 ) RESERVE JUNE 30, 2017  277 Charges 366 1,070 Cash spent ( 279 )  ( 189 ) ( 468 ) Charges against assets  ( 366 )  ( 366 ) RESERVE JUNE 30, 2018 $ $  $ $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Includes liabilities transferred to Coty related to our Beauty Brands divestiture. ##TABLE_END Separation Costs Employee separation charges for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 relate to severance packages for approximately 2,720 and 2,120 employees, respectively. The packages were primarily voluntary and the amounts were calculated based on salary levels and past service periods. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Asset-Related Costs Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal. These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other Costs Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program. Such charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain optimization. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges are funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting. Accordingly, all of the charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment. However, for informative purposes, the following table summarizes the total restructuring costs related to our reportable segments: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30 2017 Beauty $ $ $ Grooming 45 Health Care 15 Fabric  Home Care 144 Baby, Feminine  Family Care 231 Corporate (1) 229 Total Company $ 1,070 $ $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Corporate includes costs related to allocated overheads, including charges related to our Sales and Market Operations, Global Business Services and Corporate Functions activities, along with costs related to discontinued operations from our Batteries and Beauty Brands businesses. ##TABLE_ENDAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 48 The Procter  Gamble Company NOTE 4 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS The change in the net carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment was as follows: ##TABLE_START  Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric  Home Care Baby, Feminine  Family Care Corporate Total Company Balance at June 30, 2016 - Net (1) $ 12,645 $ 19,477 $ 5,840 $ 1,856 $ 4,532 $  $ 44,350 Acquisitions and divestitures   ( 10 ) ( 3 ) ( 24 )  ( 37 ) Translation and other 150 4  Balance at June 30, 2017 - Net (1) 12,791 19,627 5,878 1,857 4,546  44,699 Acquisitions and divestitures      Translation and other 193 8  Balance at June 30, 2018 - Net (1) $ 12,992 $ 19,820 $ 5,929 $ 1,865 $ 4,569 $  $ 45,175 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Grooming goodwill balance is net of $ 1.2 billion accumulated impairment losses. ##TABLE_END  During fiscal 2017 , the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories, comprised of 43 of its beauty brands (\"Beauty Brands\"). The transactions included the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color and cosmetics businesses and the fine fragrances business, along with select hair styling brands (see Note 13). The Beauty Brands had historically been part of the Company's Beauty reportable segment. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Beauty Brands are presented as discontinued operations. As a result, the goodwill attributable to the Beauty Brands as of June 30, 2016 is excluded from the preceding table. The change in goodwill during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to acquisitions of two brands within the Beauty reportable segment and currency translation across all reportable segments. The change in goodwill during fiscal 2017 was primarily due to minor brand divestitures and currency translation across all reportable segments. The goodwill and intangible asset valuations that are utilized to test these assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion, Company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those used in our valuations. To the extent such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows initially used to estimate fair value for purposes of establishing the carrying amount of goodwill and related intangible assets, we may need to record non-cash impairment charges in the future. Identifiable intangible assets were comprised of: ##TABLE_START   As of June 30 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization  Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DETERMINABLE LIVES Brands $ 3,146 $ ( 2,046 )  $ 3,094 $ ( 1,898 ) Patents and technology 2,617 ( 2,350 )  2,617 ( 2,261 ) Customer relationships 1,372 ( 616 )  1,377 ( 564 ) Other ( 144 )  ( 132 ) TOTAL $ 7,376 $ ( 5,156 )  $ 7,327 $ ( 4,855 )       INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES Brands 21,682   21,715  TOTAL $ 29,058 $ ( 5,156 )  $ 29,042 $ ( 4,855 ) ##TABLE_ENDAmortization expense of intangible assets was as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   Intangible asset amortization $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDEstimated amortization expense over the next five fiscal years is as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ending June 30 2020 2022 Estimated amortization expense $ $ $ $ $ ##TABLE_ENDAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 49 NOTE 5 INCOME TAXES Income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current year and for the impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which represent future tax consequences of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using the enacted statutory tax rates and are adjusted for any changes in such rates in the period of change. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"U.S. Tax Act\"). The U.S. Tax Act significantly revises the future ongoing U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rates and implementing a hybrid territorial tax system. As the Company has a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 28 % for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 , and 21 % for subsequent fiscal years. However, the U.S. Tax Act eliminates the domestic manufacturing deduction and moves to a hybrid territorial system, which also largely eliminates the ability to credit certain foreign taxes that existed prior to enactment of the U.S. Tax Act. There are also certain transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act. As part of the transition to the new hybrid territorial tax system, the U.S. Tax Act imposed a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate caused us to adjust our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal base rate of 21 % . These transitional impacts resulted in a provisional net charge of $ 602 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, comprised of an estimated repatriation tax charge of $ 3.8 billion (comprised of U.S. repatriation taxes and foreign withholding taxes) and an estimated net deferred tax benefit of $ 3.2 billion . The changes included in the U.S. Tax Act are broad and complex. The final transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act may differ from the above estimate, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the U.S. Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the U.S. Tax Act, or any updates or changes to estimates the Company has utilized to calculate the transitional impacts, which we expect to finalize when we complete our tax return for fiscal 2018. The SEC has issued rules that would allow for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the U.S. Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. We currently anticipate finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments within the one-year time period provided by the SEC.

Changes in uncertain tax positions represent changes in our net liability related to prior year tax positions. Excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options reflect the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09, \"Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee-Share-Based Payment Accounting).\" Tax benefits charged to shareholders' equity totaled $ 342 for the year ended June 30, 2018 . This primarily relates to the tax effects of Net Investment hedges, partially offset by the impact of certain adjustments to pension obligations recorded in stockholders' equity. Tax costs credited to shareholders' equity totaled $ 333 for the year ended June 30, 2017 . This primarily relates to the impact of certain adjustments to pension obligations recorded in stockholders' equity, partially offset by the tax effects of Net Investment hedges. Prior to the passage of the U.S. Tax Act, the Company asserted that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely invested and Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 50 The Procter  Gamble Company accordingly, no deferred taxes were provided. Pursuant to the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, these earnings were subjected to a one-time transition tax, for which a provisional charge has been recorded. This charge included provisional taxes for all U.S. income taxes and for the related foreign withholding taxes for the portion of those earnings which are no longer considered indefinitely invested. We have not provided deferred foreign withholding taxes on approximately $ 33 billion of earnings that are considered permanently reinvested. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for uncertain tax positions is as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   BEGINNING OF YEAR $  $  $ 1,096 Increases in tax positions for prior years   Decreases in tax positions for prior years ( 38 )  ( 147 )  ( 97 ) Increases in tax positions for current year   Settlements with taxing authorities ( 45 )  ( 381 )  ( 301 ) Lapse in statute of limitations ( 20 )  ( 22 )  ( 39 ) Currency translation ( 5 )  ( 4 )  ( 23 ) END OF YEAR $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDIncluded in the total liability for uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2018 , is $ 251 that, depending on the ultimate resolution, could impact the effective tax rate in future periods. The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40 - 50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and the closing of statutes of limitation. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit. While we do not expect material changes, it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to our uncertain tax positions could increase or decrease within the next 12 months. At this time, we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of uncertain tax positions or the impact on the effective tax rate related to any such changes. We recognize the additional accrual of any possible related interest and penalties relating to the underlying uncertain tax position in income tax expense. As of June 30, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , we had accrued interest of $ 99 , $ 100 and $ 323 and accrued penalties of $ 15 , $ 20 and $ 20 , respectively, which are not included in the above table. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , we recognized $( 22 ) , $ 62 and $ 2 in interest benefit/(expense) and $( 5 ) , $ 0 and $( 2 ) in penalties benefit/(expense), respectively. The net benefits recognized resulted primarily from the favorable resolution of tax positions for prior years.

The Procter  Gamble Company 51 NOTE 6 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble less preferred dividends (net of related tax benefits) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated using the treasury stock method on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards (see Note 7) and the assumed conversion of preferred stock (see Note 8).

In our main long-term incentive program, key managers can elect to receive options or RSUs. All options vest after three years and have a 10 -year life. Exercise prices on options are set equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of the grant. Effective in fiscal year 2017, RSUs vest and settle in shares of common stock three years from the grant date. RSUs granted prior to fiscal years 2017 vest and settle in shares of common stock five years from the grant date. Senior-level executives participate in an additional long-term incentive program that awards PSUs, which are paid in shares after the end of a three-year performance period. Under this program, the number of PSUs that will vest is based on the Company's performance relative to pre-established performance goals during that three year period. In addition to these long-term incentive programs, we award RSUs to the Company's non-employee directors and make other minor stock option and RSU grants to employees for which the terms are not substantially different from our long-term incentive awards. A total of 185 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the stock-based compensation plan approved by shareholders in 2014, of which 65 million shares remain available for grant. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards at the date of grant. The fair value is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are recognized as compensation expense from the grant date through the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide services to earn the award. Stock-based compensation expense is included as part of Cost of products sold and SGA in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and includes an estimate of forfeitures, which is based on historical data. Total expense and related tax benefit were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30  2017 (1)  2016 (1) Stock options $  $  $ RSUs and PSUs   Total stock-based expense $  $  $       Income tax benefit $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Includes amounts related to discontinued operations, which are not material in any period presented. ##TABLE_END We utilize an industry standard lattice-based valuation model to calculate the fair value for stock options granted. Assumptions utilized in the model, which are evaluated and revised to reflect market conditions and experience, were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   Interest rate 1.9 - 2.9 %  0.8 - 2.6 %  0.7 - 1.9 % Weighted average interest rate 2.8 %  2.6 %  1.8 % Dividend yield 3.1 %  3.2 %  3.2 % Expected volatility %  %  % Expected life in years 9.2   9.6   8.3  ##TABLE_ENDLattice-based option valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs and those ranges are disclosed in the preceding table. Expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatilities of call options on our stock. We use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination patterns within the valuation model. The expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The total grant date fair value of shares vested was $ 175 , $ 163 and $ 97 in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The Company settles equity issuances with treasury shares. We have no specific policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options, RSUs and PSUs. However, we have historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash availability, market trends and other factors, to offset the impacts of such activity. NOTE 8 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN We offer various postretirement benefits to our employees. Defined Contribution Retirement Plans We have defined contribution plans, which cover the majority of our U.S. employees, as well as employees in certain other countries. These plans are fully funded. We generally make contributions to participants' accounts based on individual base salaries and years of service. Total global defined contribution expense was $ 292 , $ 270 and $ 292 in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The primary U.S. defined contribution plan (the U.S. DC plan) comprises the majority of the expense for the Company's defined contribution plans. For the U.S. DC plan, the contribution rate is set annually. Total contributions for this plan approximated 14 % of total participants' annual wages and salaries in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . We maintain The Procter  Gamble Profit Sharing Trust (Trust) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) to provide a portion of the funding for the U.S. DC plan and other retiree benefits (described below). Operating details of the ESOP are provided at the end of this Note. The fair value of the ESOP Series A shares allocated to participants reduces our cash contribution required to fund the U.S. DC plan. Defined Benefit Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits We offer defined benefit retirement pension plans to certain employees. These benefits relate primarily to local plans outside the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, plans assumed in previous acquisitions covering U.S. employees. We also provide certain other retiree benefits, primarily health care and life insurance, for the majority of our U.S. employees who become eligible for these benefits when they meet minimum age and service requirements. Generally, the health care plans require cost sharing with retirees and pay a stated percentage of expenses, reduced by deductibles and other coverages. These benefits are primarily funded by ESOP Series B shares and certain other assets contributed by the Company. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 54 The Procter  Gamble Company Obligation and Funded Status .

We determine our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis. These assumptions are weighted to reflect each country that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits. The weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, were as follows: (1)  ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits As of June 30    Discount rate 2.5 %  2.4 %  4.2 %  3.9 % Rate of compensation increase 2.6 %  3.0 %  N/A  N/A Health care cost trend rates assumed for next year N/A  N/A  6.6 %  6.4 % Rate to which the health care cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend rate) N/A  N/A  4.9 %  4.9 % Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate N/A  N/A   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Determined as of end of fiscal year. ##TABLE_END The weighted average assumptions used to determine net benefit cost recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the years ended June 30, were as follows: (1)  ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits Years ended June 30      Discount rate 2.4 %  2.1 %  3.1 %  3.9 %  3.6 %  4.5 % Expected return on plan assets 6.8 %  6.9 %  7.2 %  8.3 %  8.3 %  8.3 % Rate of compensation increase 3.0 %  2.9 %  3.1 %  N/A  N/A  N/A ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Determined as of beginning of fiscal year. ##TABLE_END For plans that make up the majority of our obligation, the Company calculates the benefit obligation and the related impacts on service and interest costs using specific spot rates along the corporate bond yield curve. For the remaining plans, the Company determines these amounts utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the corporate bond yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. Several factors are considered in developing the estimate for the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets. For the defined benefit retirement plans, these factors include historical rates of return of broad equity and bond indices and projected long-term rates of return obtained from pension investment consultants. The expected long-term rates of return for plan assets are 8 - 9 % for equities and 5 - 6 % for bonds. For other retiree benefit plans, the expected long-term rate of return reflects that the assets are comprised primarily of Company stock. The expected rate of return on Company stock is based on the long-term projected return of 8.5 % and reflects the historical pattern of returns. Assumed health care cost trend rates could have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other retiree benefit plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: ##TABLE_START  One-Percentage Point Increase  One-Percentage Point Decrease Effect on the total service and interest cost components $  $ ( 47 ) Effect on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation  ( 585 ) ##TABLE_ENDPlan Assets . Our investment objective for defined benefit retirement plan assets is to meet the plans' benefit obligations and to improve plan self-sufficiency for future benefit obligations. The investment strategies focus on asset class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit payments and an appropriate balance of long-term investment return and risk. Target ranges for asset allocations are determined by assessing different investment risks and matching the actuarial projections of the plans' future liabilities and benefit payments with current as well as expected long-term rates of return on the assets, taking into account investment return volatility and correlations across asset classes. Plan assets are diversified across several investment managers and are generally invested in liquid funds that are selected to track broad market equity and bond indices. Investment risk is carefully controlled with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and with continual monitoring of investment managers' performance relative to the investment guidelines established with each investment manager. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 57 Our target asset allocation for the year ended June 30, 2018 , and actual asset allocation by asset category as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 , were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Target Asset Allocation  Actual Asset Allocation at June 30  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits Asset Category      Cash  %  %  %  %  %  % Debt securities %  %  %  %  %  % Equity securities %  %  %  %  %  % TOTAL %  %  %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDThe following tables set forth the fair value of the Company's plan assets as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy (refer to Note 9 for further discussion on the fair value hierarchy and fair value principles). Company stock listed as Level 2 in the hierarchy represents preferred shares which are valued based on the value of Company common stock. The majority of our Level 3 pension assets are insurance contracts. Their fair values are based on their cash equivalent or models that project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs, including credit risk and interest rate curves. There was no significant activity within the Level 3 pension and other retiree benefits plan assets during the years presented. Investments valued using net asset value as a practical expedient are primarily equity and fixed income collective funds. These assets are not valued using the fair value hierarchy, but rather valued using the net asset value reported by the managers of the funds and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits As of June 30 Fair Value Hierarchy Level    Fair Value Hierarchy Level   ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE            Cash and cash equivalents  $  $   $  $ Company stock (1)        3,092  3,643 Other (2) 1, 2  3      TOTAL ASSETS IN THE FAIR VALUE HEIRARCHY       3,101  3,656 Investments valued at net asset value   10,731  10,530     TOTAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE   $ 11,267  10,829    $ 3,259  3,831 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Company stock is net of ESOP debt discussed below . ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  The Company's other pension plan assets measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.

Management's best estimate of cash requirements and discretionary contributions for the defined benefit retirement plans and other retiree benefit plans for the year ending June 30, 2019 , is $ 134 and $ 39 , respectively. For the defined benefit retirement plans, this is comprised of $ 82 in expected benefit payments from the Company directly to participants of unfunded plans and $ 52 of expected contributions to funded plans. For other retiree benefit plans, this is comprised of $ 24 in expected benefit payments from the Company directly to participants of unfunded plans and $ 15 of expected contributions to funded plans. Expected contributions are dependent on many variables, including the variability of the market value of the plan assets as compared to the benefit obligation and other market or regulatory conditions. In addition, we take into consideration our business investment opportunities and resulting cash requirements. Accordingly, actual funding may differ significantly from current estimates. Total benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which include payments funded from the Company's assets and payments from the plans are as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ending June 30 Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS   $  $ 2020  2021  2022  2023  2024 - 2028 3,280  1,339 ##TABLE_ENDAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 58 The Procter  Gamble Company Employee Stock Ownership Plan We maintain the ESOP to provide funding for certain employee benefits discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The ESOP borrowed $ 1.0 billion in 1989 and the proceeds were used to purchase Series A ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the U.S. DC plan. Principal and interest requirements of the borrowing were paid by the Trust from dividends on the preferred shares and from advances provided by the Company. The original borrowing of $ 1.0 billion has been repaid in full, and advances from the Company of $ 52 remain outstanding at June 30, 2018 . Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock. The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $ 2.79 per share. The liquidation value is $ 6.82 per share. In 1991, the ESOP borrowed an additional $ 1.0 billion . The proceeds were used to purchase Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of retiree health care benefits. These shares, net of the ESOP's debt, are considered plan assets of the other retiree benefits plan discussed above. Debt service requirements are funded by preferred stock dividends, cash contributions and advances provided by the Company, of which $ 825 are outstanding at June 30, 2018 . Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock. The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $ 2.79 per share. The liquidation value is $ 12.96 per share. Our ESOP accounting practices are consistent with current ESOP accounting guidance, including the permissible continuation of certain provisions from prior accounting guidance. ESOP debt, which is guaranteed by the Company, is recorded as debt (see Note 10) with an offset to the Reserve for ESOP debt retirement, which is presented within Shareholders' equity. Advances to the ESOP by the Company are recorded as an increase in the Reserve for ESOP debt retirement. Interest incurred on the ESOP debt is recorded as Interest expense. Dividends on all preferred shares, net of related tax benefits, are charged to Retained earnings. The series A and B preferred shares of the ESOP are allocated to employees based on debt service requirements. The number of preferred shares outstanding at June 30 was as follows: ##TABLE_START Shares in thousands   Allocated 34,233  36,488  39,241 Unallocated 4,117  5,060  6,095 TOTAL SERIES A 38,350  41,548  45,336     Allocated 25,895  25,378  23,925 Unallocated 28,512  30,412  32,319 TOTAL SERIES B 54,407  55,790  56,244 ##TABLE_ENDFor purposes of calculating diluted net earnings per common share, the preferred shares held by the ESOP are considered converted from inception. NOTE 9 RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. To the extent we choose to manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions that we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. If the Company elects to do so and if the instrument meets certain specified accounting criteria, management designates derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges. We record derivative instruments at fair value and the accounting for changes in the fair value depends on the intended use of the derivative, the resulting designation and the effectiveness of the instrument in offsetting the risk exposure it is designed to hedge. We generally have a high degree of effectiveness between the exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument. Credit Risk Management We have counterparty credit guidelines and normally enter into transactions with investment grade financial institutions, to the extent commercially viable. Counterparty exposures are monitored daily and downgrades in counterparty credit ratings are reviewed on a timely basis. We have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, material credit losses on our risk management or other financial instruments. Substantially all of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position as of June 30, 2018 , was not material. The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features. Interest Rate Risk Management Our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. To manage this risk in a cost-efficient manner, we enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to exchange with the counterparty, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional amount. We designate certain interest rate swaps that meet specific accounting criteria as fair value hedges. For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in earnings. Historically, we had interest rate swaps Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 59 designated as cash flow hedges. For the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, we did not have any contracts outstanding. Foreign Currency Risk Management We manufacture and sell our products and finance our operations in a number of countries throughout the world. As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We leverage the Companys diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge. In certain cases, we enter into non-qualifying foreign currency contracts to hedge certain balance sheet items subject to revaluation. The change in fair value of these instruments and the underlying exposure are both immediately recognized in earnings. To manage exchange rate risk related to our intercompany financing, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps. The change in fair value of these non-qualifying instruments is immediately recognized in earnings, substantially offsetting the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. Historically, we had certain foreign currency swaps with original maturities up to five years , which were intended to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies; these swaps were accounted for as cash flow hedges. Those swaps were terminated during the year ended June 30, 2017 and as a result, there was an immaterial gain reclassified from AOCI into earnings for the year ended June 30, 2017 in the following tables but there were no outstanding contracts as of June 30, 2018 and 2017. Net Investment Hedging We hedge certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries. To accomplish this, we either borrow directly in foreign currencies and designate all or a portion of the foreign currency debt as a hedge of the applicable net investment position or we enter into foreign currency swaps that are designated as hedges of net investments. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in OCI and offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. Upon adoption of ASU 2017-12, the time value component of the net investment hedge currency swaps is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and reported in income on a systematic basis. Changes in the fair value of the swap, including changes in the fair value of the excluded time value component, are recognized in OCI and offset the value of the underlying net assets. Commodity Risk Management Certain raw materials used in our products or production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. To manage the volatility related to anticipated purchases of certain of these materials, we have historically, on a limited basis, used futures and options with maturities generally less than one year and swap contracts with maturities up to five years . As of and during the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 , we did not have any commodity hedging activity. Insurance We self-insure for most insurable risks. However, we purchase insurance for Directors and Officers Liability and certain other coverage where it is required by law or by contract. Fair Value Hierarchy Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: ##TABLE_START  Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets. ##TABLE_END When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets or liabilities during the year. Our fair value estimates take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and our counterparties. When active market quotes are not available for financial assets and liabilities, we use industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including credit risk, interest rate curves, foreign currency rates and forward and spot prices for currencies. In circumstances where market-based observable inputs are not available, management judgment is used to develop assumptions to estimate fair value. Generally, the fair value of our Level 3 instruments is estimated as the net present value of expected future cash flows based on external inputs. T he following table sets forth the Company's financial assets as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period: ##TABLE_START  Fair Value Asset As of June 30  Investments:    U.S. government securities $ 5,544  $ 6,297 Corporate bond securities 3,737  3,271 Other investments  TOTAL $ 9,422  $ 9,700 ##TABLE_ENDInvestment securities are presented in Available-for-sale investment securities and Other noncurrent assets. The amortized cost of the U.S. government securities with maturities less than one year was $ 2,003 and $ 2,494 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The amortized cost of the U.S. government securities with maturities between one and five years was $ 3,659 and $ 3,824 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The amortized cost of corporate bond securities with maturities of less than a year was $ 1,291 and $ 730 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 60 The Procter  Gamble Company amortized cost of corporate bond securities with maturities between one and five years was $ 2,503 and $ 2,547 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The Company's investments measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. There are no material investment balances classified as Level 1 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, or using net asset value as a practical expedient. Fair values are generally estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of long-term debt was $ 23,402 and $ 21,396 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. This includes the current portion of debt instruments ( $ 1,769 and $ 1,694 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost, but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Notional Amount  Fair Value Asset  Fair Value (Liability) As of June 30      DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS       Interest rate contracts $ 4,587  $ 4,552  $  $  $ ( 53 )  $ ( 2 ) DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS       Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 1,848  $ 6,102  $  $  $ ( 75 )  $ ( 177 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 6,435  $ 10,654  $  $  $ ( 128 )  $ ( 179 )             DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS       Foreign currency contracts $ 7,358  $ 4,969  $  $  $ ( 56 )  $ ( 7 )             TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 13,793  $ 15,623  $  $  $ ( 184 )  $ ( 186 ) ##TABLE_ENDAll derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/liability directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $ 4,639 and $ 4,705 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 15,012 and $ 19,030 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The decrease in the notional balance of the net investment hedges, including the debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, is primarily driven by the reduction in net foreign currency hedgeable assets as a result of US tax reform. The increase in the notional balance of foreign currency contracts not designated as hedging instruments reflects changes in the level of intercompany financing activity during the period. All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. In addition, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 .

These amounts relate to accumulated translation associated with foreign entities sold as part of the sale of the Beauty Brands business. ##TABLE_END NOTE 12 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Guarantees In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may provide routine indemnifications (e.g., indemnification for representations and warranties and retention of previously existing environmental, tax and employee liabilities) for which terms range in duration and, in some circumstances, are not explicitly defined. The maximum obligation under some indemnifications is also not explicitly stated and, as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss on any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In certain situations, we guarantee loans for suppliers and customers. The total amount of guarantees issued under such arrangements is not material. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that have a material impact on our financial statements. Purchase Commitments and Operating Leases We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations are as follows:  ##TABLE_START Years ending June 30 2020 2022 There-after Purchase obligations $ $ $ $ $ $ ##TABLE_ENDSuch amounts represent minimum commitments under take-or-pay agreements with suppliers and are in line with expected Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 64 The Procter  Gamble Company usage. These amounts include purchase commitments related to service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced to third-party suppliers. Such amounts also include arrangements with suppliers that qualify as embedded operating leases. Due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination. We do not expect to incur penalty payments under these provisions that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We also lease certain property and equipment for varying periods. Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases, net of guaranteed sublease income, are as follows:  ##TABLE_START Years ending June 30 2020 2022 There-after Operating leases $ $ $ $ $ $ ##TABLE_ENDLitigation We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. NOTE 13 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories to Coty, Inc. (Coty). The divestiture included 41 of the Company's beauty brands (Beauty Brands), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and a majority of the fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. The form of the divestiture transaction was a Reverse Morris Trust split-off, in which PG shareholders were given the election to exchange their PG shares for shares of a new corporation that held the Beauty Brands (Galleria Co.), and then immediately exchange those shares for Coty shares. The value PG received in the transaction was $ 11.4 billion . The value was comprised of 105 million shares of common stock of the Company, which were tendered by shareholders of the Company and exchanged for the Galleria Co. shares, valued at approximately $ 9.4 billion , and the assumption of $ 1.9 billion of debt by Galleria Co. The shares tendered in the transaction were reflected as an addition to treasury stock and the cash received related to the debt assumed by Coty was reflected as an investing activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the final transaction of $ 5.3 billion , net of transaction and related costs. Two of the fine fragrance brands, Dolce  Gabbana and Christina Aguilera, were excluded from the divestiture. These brands were subsequently divested at amounts that approximated their adjusted carrying values. In February 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business to Berkshire Hathaway (BH) via a split transaction, in which the Company exchanged the Duracell Company, which the Company had infused with additional cash, to repurchase all 52.5 million shares of PG stock owned by BH. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 , the Company recorded non-cash, before-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived asset impairment charges of $ 402 ( $ 350 after tax), to reduce the Batteries carrying value to the total estimated proceeds based on the value of BHs shares in PG stock at the time of the impairment charges (see Note 4). The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the final transaction of $ 422 to reflect a subsequent increase in the final value of the BHs shares in PG stock. The total value of the transaction was $ 4.2 billion representing the value of the Duracell business and the cash infusion. The cash infusion of $ 1.7 billion was reflected as a purchase of treasury stock. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Beauty Brands and Batteries businesses are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. The Beauty Brands were historically part of the Company's Beauty reportable segment. The Batteries business was historically part of the Company's Fabric  Home Care reportable segment.

The new requirements are effective for discontinued operations occurring on or after the adoption date, which includes the Beauty Brands divestiture. Discontinued operations prior to July 1, 2015, which included the Batteries divestiture, are reported based on the previous disclosure requirements for discontinued operations.

All options became immediately vested and exercisable on October 1, 2005 as a result of the merger. After the merger, all outstanding options became options to purchase shares of The Procter  Gamble Company subject to an exchange ratio of .975 shares of PG stock per share of Gillette stock. Only employees previously employed by The Gillette Company prior to October 1, 2005 are eligible to receive grants under this plan. The last grant of equity under this plan was on February 27, 2009. The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate employees of The Gillette Company and, until the effective date of the merger between The Gillette Company and The Procter  Gamble Company, non-employee members of the Gillette Board of Directors. Under the plan, eligible participants are: (i) granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii) granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii) granted shares of the Company's common stock or restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents).

Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the \"Company,\" \"PG,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" as used herein refer to The Procter  Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries. The Procter  Gamble Company is focused on providing branded products of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world's consumers, now and for generations to come. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having been built from a business founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. Today, our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories. Throughout this Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains these reports at: www.sec.gov. You can also access these reports through links from our website at: www.pginvestor.com.

Financial Information about Segments Information about our reportable segments can be found in the MDA and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Narrative Description of Business Business Model . Our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products, as well as the creation of new innovative products. The markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories through numerous channels as well as direct-to-consumer. Our growth strategy is to deliver meaningful and noticeable superiority in all elements of our consumer proposition - product, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value equation. We use our research and development and consumer insights to provide superior products and packaging. We utilize our marketing and online presence to deliver superior brand messaging to our consumers. We work collaboratively with our customers to deliver superior retail execution, both in-store and online. In conjunction with the above elements, we provide superior value to consumers and our retail customers, in each price tier where we compete. Key Product Categories . Information on key product categories can be found in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Key Customers . Our customers include mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We also sell direct to consumers. Sales to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 15% of our total sales in 2019 and 2018 and 16% in 2017 . No other customer represents more than 10% of our total sales. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 36% of our total sales in 2019 and 2018 , and 35% in 2017 . The nature of our business does not result in material backlog orders or contracts with the government. We believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete. Sources and Availability of Materials . Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from others, some of whom are single-source suppliers. We produce certain raw materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing process and in the transportation of input materials and finished products to customers. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers. The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, none of which is material to our business taken as a whole. Trademarks and Patents . We own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks, which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. All major trademarks in each business are registered. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses. Competitive Condition . The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. We support our products with advertising, promotions and other marketing vehicles to build awareness and trial of our brands and products in conjunction with our sales force. We believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products. Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important differentiating factors. Expenditures for Environmental Compliance . Expenditures for compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws 2 The Procter  Gamble Company and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not material to the Company. No material change is expected in fiscal year 2020 . Employees . Total number of employees is an estimate of total Company employees excluding interns, co-ops, contractors and employees of joint ventures as of the years ended June 30. The number of employees includes manufacturing and non-manufacturing employees. The number of employees is not restated to exclude employees of discontinued operations. ##TABLE_START  Total Number of Employees 97,000 92,000 95,000 105,000 110,000 118,000 ##TABLE_END", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-K, quarterly and annual reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. The following discussion of risk factors identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with the MDA and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes incorporated in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. Our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility. We are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world. We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our operations outside the U.S. generate more than fifty percent of our net revenue. Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in U.S. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition. Moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries, including changes to tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could adversely affect our results. See also the Results of Operations and Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity sections of the MDA and Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls or restrictions, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt and Turkey. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business. Additionally, our business, operations or employees may be adversely affected by political volatility, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval, broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments, particularly in emerging markets. Uncertain global economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, which could adversely impact our business. Our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic disruptions, such as: a slow-down in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers; a significant shift in government policies; the deterioration of economic relations between countries or regions, including potential negative consumer sentiment toward non-local products or sources; or the inability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. Additionally, economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third-party partners to suffer financial difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles. In addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient income and cash flow, it could affect the Companys ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments. The Procter  Gamble Company 3 Disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit. A disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. Disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results. Our ability to meet our customers needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. The loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity in our internal information and data systems, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials, significant changes in trade policy, natural disasters, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise, acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare. Therefore, our business results are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our financial results. Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits . We are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. Achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. The success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. We must also successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors. Failure to continually innovate, improve and respond to competitive moves and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels. The consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry into certain categories, and growth in hard discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile commerce applications, could negatively impact our results. A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level or shelf space of our products as a result of increased offerings of private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption. If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. The Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results could also be negatively impacted if 4 The Procter  Gamble Company one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients or environmental impacts, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer. Our Company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, diversity and inclusion, gender equality and environmental sustainability. If these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, the Company's reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. Due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, for certain functions. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our financial results could suffer. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. An information security or operational technology incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems, networks, hardware, processes, and/or associated sites owned or operated by the Company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. As part of the Companys regular review of potential risks, we maintain an information and operational technology (IT/OT) risk management program that is primarily supervised by information technology management and reviewed by internal cross-functional stakeholders. As part of this program, analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats as well as the Companys plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. Despite our policies, procedures and programs, including this IT/OT risk management program, we may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to which we are exposed. We rely extensively on IT/OT systems, networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and technologies, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. The various uses of these IT/OT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: ##TABLE_START  ordering and managing materials from suppliers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  converting materials to finished products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  shipping products to customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  marketing and selling products to consumers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  collecting, transferring, storing and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data, including such data from persons covered by an expanding landscape of privacy and data regulations, such as citizens of the European Union who are covered by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  providing data security; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  handling other processes necessary to manage our business. ##TABLE_END Numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks and supply chain, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations. As cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally, the Company is continually increasing its attention to these threats. We assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments seeking to address them, including ongoing monitoring and updating of networks and systems, increasing specialized information security skills, deploying employee security training, and updating security policies for the Company and its third-party providers. However, because the techniques, tools and tactics used in cyber-attacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack. Our IT/OT databases and systems and our third-party providers databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and other cyber-attacks. Such attacks may originate from The Procter  Gamble Company 5 outside parties, hackers, criminal organizations or other threat actors, including nation states. In addition, insider actors-malicious or otherwise-could cause technical disruptions and/or confidential data leakage. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks; however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party providers will prevent material breaches, operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our third-party providers IT/OT databases or systems. Periodically, we also need to upgrade our IT/OT systems or adopt new technologies. If such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures, it could affect our ability to order materials, make and ship orders, and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues. Further, if the IT/OT systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations, or inadvertent disclosure of, lack of integrity of, or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling, security incidents or employee error or malfeasance, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. The costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results. Changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results. Changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, the United Kingdoms pending withdrawal from the European Union (\"Brexit\") has created uncertainty regarding, among other things, the U.K.'s future legal and economic framework and how the U.K. will interact with other countries, including with respect to the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. In addition, results of elections, referendums or other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured, sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, taxes, the movement of goods, services, capital and people between countries and other matters. The potential implications of such uncertainty, which include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, trade barriers and market contraction, could adversely affect the Companys business and financial results. We must successfully manage compliance with laws and regulations, as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the U.S. and abroad. Our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business, including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property, product liability, product composition or formulation, packaging content or disposability, marketing, antitrust, data protection, environmental (including climate, water, waste), employment, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, tax, accounting and financial reporting or other matters. Rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, as well as increased enforcement actions, create challenges for the Company, including our compliance and ethics programs, may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance, which could adversely impact our financial results. If we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. Failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. Furthermore, if pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results. The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the various tax laws can and do occur. For example, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the U.S. Tax Act). The changes included in the U.S. Tax Act are broad and complex. The ongoing impacts of the U.S. Tax Act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, any regulatory guidance or legislative action to address questions that arise or any updates or changes to estimates the Company has used to calculate the impacts. Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each countrys jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are subject to potential evolution. An outgrowth of the original Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS\") project is a new project undertaken by the 129 member countries of the expanded OECD Inclusive Framework focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy.\" The breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by potentially redefining jurisdictional taxation rights. As this and other tax laws and related regulations change or evolve, our financial results could be materially impacted. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results. Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities. While we believe our tax positions will be sustained, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 6 The Procter  Gamble Company Beauty Brands transaction with Coty, may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements, which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results. We must successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures. Our financial results could also be impacted by acquisitions or joint venture activities, such as the integration of Merck KGaA's Consumer Health business acquired in fiscal 2019, if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets. Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change. Our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings, including staffing adjustments as well as employee departures. Failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings, while continuing to invest in business growth, could adversely impact our financial results. Additionally, successfully executing organizational change, including the move to a new organizational structure in fiscal 2020, management transitions at leadership levels of the Company and motivation and retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers and availability of qualified personnel. Our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense, as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Management's Discussion and Analysis Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including without limitation, the following sections: Management's Discussion and Analysis and Risk Factors. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believe, project, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, strategy, future, opportunity, plan, may, should, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein is included, without limitation, in the section titled \"Economic Conditions and Uncertainties\" and the section titled Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MDA) is to provide an understanding of Procter  Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MDA is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The MDA is organized in the following sections: ##TABLE_START  Overview ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Summary of 2019 Results ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Economic Conditions and Uncertainties ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Results of Operations ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Segment Results ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other Information ##TABLE_END Throughout the MDA we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign exchange and the fiscal 2019 adoption of new accounting standards for \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and transitional tax payments related to the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of the MDA provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MDA are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal-year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. OVERVIEW Procter  Gamble is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We also sell direct to consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products, as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. 12 The Procter  Gamble Company ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE In fiscal 2019, our organizational structure was comprised of Global Business Units (GBUs), Selling and Market Operations (SMOs), Global Business Services (GBS) and Corporate Functions (CF). Global Business Units Our GBUs are organized into ten product categories. Under U.S. GAAP, the GBUs underlying the ten product categories are aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty ; Grooming ; Health Care ; Fabric  Home Care ; and Baby, Feminine  Family Care . The GBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the ten product categories and brand composition within each segment. ##TABLE_START Reportable Segments % of Net Sales (1) % of Net Earnings (1) Product Categories (Sub-Categories) Major Brands Beauty 19% 22% Hair Care ( Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments ) Head  Shoulders, Herbal Essences, Pantene, Rejoice Skin and Personal Care ( Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care ) Olay, Old Spice, Safeguard, SK-II, Secret Grooming 9% 13% Grooming  (2) (Shave Care - Female Blades  Razors, Male Blades  Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care; Appliances) Braun, Gillette, Venus Health Care 12% 13% Oral Care ( Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care ) Crest, Oral-B Personal Health Care ( Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care ) Metamucil, Neurobion, Pepto Bismol, Vicks Fabric  Home Care 33% 29% Fabric Care ( Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents ) Ariel, Downy, Gain, Tide Home Care ( Air Care, Dish Care, PG Professional, Surface Care ) Cascade, Dawn, Fairy, Febreze, Mr. Clean, Swiffer Baby, Feminine  Family Care 27% 23% Baby Care ( Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants ) Luvs, Pampers Feminine Care ( Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care ) Always, Always Discreet, Tampax Family Care ( Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper ) Bounty, Charmin, Puffs ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Percent of Net sales and Net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2019 (excluding results held in Corporate). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The Grooming product category is comprised of the Shave Care and Appliances GBUs.  ##TABLE_END Recent Developments: During fiscal 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of the over the counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) for $3.7 billion (based on exchange rates at the time of closing). This business primarily sells OTC consumer healthcare products, mainly in Europe, Latin America and Asia markets. Total sales for the business during Merck OTC's most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $1 billion. During fiscal 2019, the Company also dissolved our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business. Pursuant to the agreement, PGT product assets were returned to the original respective parent companies to reestablish independent OTC businesses. This transaction was accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the PGT business. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of $353 million. During fiscal 2017, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories, which included 43 of the Company's beauty brands (\"Beauty Brands\"), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and the fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. The Beauty Brands had historically been part of the Companys Beauty reportable segment. The results of the Beauty Brands are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Refer to Notes 13 and 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on each of these transactions. Organization Design Changes: The Company recently announced changes to our organization design effective July 1, 2019. In the new design, the ten product categories are being organized into six Sector Business Units (SBUs). The SBUs will be responsible for global brand strategy, innovation and supply chain. They will have direct profit responsibility for markets representing the large majority The Procter  Gamble Company 13 of the Company's sales and earnings (referred to as Focus Markets) and will be responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). For segment reporting purposes, the categories will continue to be aggregated into the same five external reporting segments. Beauty : We are a global market leader in the beauty category. Most of the beauty markets in which we compete are highly fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. We compete in skin and personal care and in hair care. In skin and personal care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to personal cleansing to skin care, such as our Olay brand, which is one of the top facial skin care brands in the world with nearly 6% global market share. We are the global market leader in the retail hair care market with over 20% global market share primarily behind our Pantene and Head  Shoulders brands. Grooming : We compete in shave care and appliances. In shave care, we are the global market leader in the blades and razors market. Our global blades and razors market share is over 60%, primarily behind the Gillette franchise, including our Fusion, Mach3, Prestobarba and Venus brands. Our appliances, such as electric shavers and epilators, are sold under the Braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. We hold nearly 25% of the male electric shavers market and over 50% of the female epilators market. Health Care : We compete in oral care and personal health care. In oral care, there are several global competitors in the market and we have the number two market share position with nearly 20% global market share behind our Oral-B and Crest brands. In personal health care, we are a top ten competitor in a large, highly fragmented industry, primarily behind respiratory treatments (Vicks brand) and digestive wellness products (Metamucil, Pepto Bismol and Align brands). As discussed above, in fiscal 2019, we dissolved the PGT Healthcare partnership with Teva, which previously managed nearly all of our personal health care sales outside the U.S., and reestablished independent OTC businesses. We also acquired Merck OTC as discussed above. Fabric  Home Care : This segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products, including laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; and home care products, including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners. In fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two market share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader with over 25% global market share, primarily behind our Tide, Ariel and Downy brands. Our global home care market share is over 20% across the categories in which we compete. Baby, Feminine  Family Care : In baby care, we are the global market leader and compete mainly in taped diapers, pants and baby wipes with over 25% global market share. We have the number one or number two market share position in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind Pampers, the Company's largest brand, with annual net sales of nearly $8 billion. We are the global market leader in the feminine care category with 25% global market share, primarily behind Always. We also compete in the adult incontinence category in certain markets behind Always Discreet, achieving nearly 10% market share in most of the markets where we compete. Our family care business is predominantly a North American business comprised largely of the Bounty paper towel and Charmin toilet paper brands. U.S. market shares are over 40% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin. Selling and Market Operations Our SMOs are responsible for developing and executing go-to-market plans at the local level. The SMOs include dedicated retail customer, trade channel and country-specific teams. Our SMOs are organized under six regions, comprised of North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Greater China and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA). Throughout the MDA, we reference business results in developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan, and developing markets, which are all other markets not included in developed. As a result of the above-mentioned changes in our organization design effective July 1, 2019, we will be organized under five regions, with Asia Pacific and IMEA being combined into a single region. Corporate Functions Corporate Functions provides company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources and legal, as well as other centralized functional support. Global Business Services GBS provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the GBUs, the SMOs and Corporate Functions to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment. STRATEGIC FOCUS Procter  Gamble aspires to serve the worlds consumers better than our best competitors in every category and in every country in which we compete, and, as a result, deliver total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. Delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top-line growth, bottom-line growth and strong cash generation. Our strategic choices are focused on winning with consumers. The consumers who purchase and use our products are at the center of everything we do. We win with consumers by delivering superiority across the five key elements of product, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value equation. Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires innovation. Innovation has always been, and continues to be, PGs lifeblood. Innovation requires consumer insights and technology advancements that lead to product improvements, improved marketing and 14 The Procter  Gamble Company merchandising programs and game-changing inventions that create new brands and categories. Productivity improvement is critical to delivering our balanced top-line growth, bottom-line growth and value creation objectives. Productivity improvement and sales growth reinforce and fuel each other. We are driving productivity improvement across all elements of cost, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional expenses and non-manufacturing overhead. Productivity improvements and cost savings are being reinvested in product and packaging improvements, brand awareness-building advertising and trial-building sampling programs, increased sales coverage and RD programs. We are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs. The Company has undertaken an effort to focus and strengthen its business portfolio to compete in categories and with brands that are structurally attractive and that play to PG's strengths. The ongoing portfolio of businesses consists of 10 product categories. These are categories where PG has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies. We believe these strategies are right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term annual financial targets will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive peer group: ##TABLE_START  Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Core EPS growth of mid-to-high single digits; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater. ##TABLE_END In periods with significant macroeconomic pressures, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to investing so as not to sacrifice the long-term health of our businesses to meet short-term objectives in any given year. SUMMARY OF 2019 RESULTS ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions, except per share amounts   Change vs. Prior Year Net sales $ 67,684  $ 66,832  % Operating income 5,487  13,363  (59 )% Net earnings 3,966  9,861  (60 )% Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble 3,897  9,750  (60 )% Diluted net earnings per common share 1.43  3.67  (61 )% Core earnings per share 4.52  4.22  % Cash flow from operating activities 15,242  14,867  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net sales increased 1% to $67.7 billion on a 3% increase in unit volume. Foreign exchange had a negative 4% impact on net sales. Net sales growth was driven by mid-single digit increases in Beauty and Health Care and a low single digit increase in Fabric  Home Care, partially offset by a low single digit decline in Baby, Feminine  Family Care and a mid-single digit decline in Grooming. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Organic sales increased 5% on a 2% increase in organic volume. Organic sales increased high single digits in Beauty and Fabric  Home Care, increased mid-single digits in Health Care and increased low single digits in Grooming and Baby, Feminine  Family Care. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Unit volumes increased 3%. Volume increased mid-single digits in Health Care and Fabric  Home Care and increased low single digits in Beauty and Baby, Feminine  Family Care. Volume decreased low single digits in Grooming. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating income decreased $7.9 billion, or 59%, due primarily to non-cash impairment charges of $8.3 billion related to Shave Care goodwill and Gillette indefinite-lived intangible assets (Shave Care impairment), partially offset by the benefit from the net sales increase. For a more detailed discussion on the Shave Care impairment refer to ##TABLE_ENDthe Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates section in the MDA and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_START  Net earnings decreased $5.9 billion or 60% due to the after-tax impact of the Shave Care impairment, partially offset by a reduction in current year income tax expense, a current year gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership and the base period charges for the early extinguishment of debt. The reduction in current year income tax expense was driven by the impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (U.S. Tax Act), comprised of the reduction in tax rate on the current year earnings and the base period charges related to the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act. Foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately $900 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble were $3.9 billion , a decrease of $5.9 billion or 60% versus the prior year primarily due to the aforementioned items. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Diluted net earnings per share decreased 61% to $1.43 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Core EPS increased 7% to $4.52 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash flow from operating activities was $15.2 billion . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adjusted free cash flow was $12.1 billion . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 105% . ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company 15 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are \"forward-looking statements\" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macro-economic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest in the Middle East, Central  Eastern Europe and the Korean peninsula, economic uncertainty related to the execution of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American and Asian markets and overall economic slowdowns, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings. Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. If we are unable to manage commodity and other cost fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings. Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. As discussed later in this MDA, in 2012 we initiated overhead and supply chain cost improvement projects. In fiscal 2017, we communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year cost reduction program which is resulting in enrollment reductions and other savings. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings. Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In four of the past five years, including fiscal 2019, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies, leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, China and the United Kingdom have had, and could continue to have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales and profits. Government Policies. Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies, for example, the U.S. Tax Act, the implications and uncertainties of which are disclosed elsewhere in this report. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt and Turkey. Further, our earnings and sales could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including increases of import tariffs, both currently effective and future potential changes. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SGA), other non-operating items and income taxes. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending, retail executions, both in-store and online and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as our pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the U.S. Most of our cost of products sold and SGA are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input 16 The Procter  Gamble Company costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SGA are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth. A detailed discussion of the fiscal 2018 year-over-year changes can be found in the MDA section in the Form 8-K filed October 22, 2018, which updated our Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018, to revise disclosures to reflect the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASU 2017-07 and 2016-18. For more information on the adoption of this standard, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Sales Net sales increased 1% to $67.7 billion in 2019 on a 3% increase in unit volume versus the prior year. Volume increased mid-single digits in Health Care and Fabric  Home Care and increased low single digits in Beauty and Baby, Feminine  Family Care. Volume decreased low single digits in Grooming. Volume increased mid-single digits in developed regions and low single digits in developing regions. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased low single digits in developed regions. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 4%. Pricing had a positive 2% impact on net sales. Product mix had a positive 1% impact on net sales driven by the slightly higher organic growth of the Skin and Personal Care and Personal Health Care categories and developed regions, all of which have higher than company average selling prices. Organic sales grew 5% driven by a 2% increase in organic volume. Operating Costs ##TABLE_START Comparisons as a percentage of net sales; Years ended June 30   Basis Point Change Gross margin 48.6 %  48.5 %  Selling, general and administrative expense 28.2 %  28.5 %  (30 ) Operating margin 8.1 %  20.0 %  (1,190 ) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 9.0 %  19.9 %  (1,090 ) Net earnings 5.9 %  14.8 %  (890 ) Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble 5.8 %  14.6 %  (880 ) ##TABLE_ENDGross margin increased 10 basis points to 48.6% of net sales in 2019 . Gross margin benefited 160 basis points from total manufacturing cost savings (130 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments), 60 basis points of positive pricing impacts and 50 basis points from lower restructuring costs. These were offset by: ##TABLE_START  a 100 basis-point decline from unfavorable product mix and other impacts (primarily mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin product forms and the club channel in certain categories and due to the disproportionate growth of the Fabric Care category, which is one of our largest categories and has lower than company-average gross margins), ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  an 80 basis-point negative impact due to higher commodity costs and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 50 basis-point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. ##TABLE_END Total SGA was relatively unchanged at $19.1 billion , as a decrease in marketing spending was offset by an increase in overhead costs and in other net operating expenses. SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 28.2% . Reductions in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales were partially offset by an increase in overhead costs and other net operating expenses as a percentage of sales. ##TABLE_START  Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 80 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the organic net sales increase, reductions in agency compensation and the impact of adopting the new standard on \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" which prospectively reclassified certain customer spending from marketing (SGA) expense to a reduction of net sales. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points, as productivity savings and fixed cost leverage from the increased organic net sales, were more than offset by the impact of inflation, higher incentive compensation costs and other cost increases, including the ongoing and integration-related overhead costs of the Merck OTC acquisition. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other net operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange transactional charges and the net impact of changes in indirect tax reserves, partially offset by the gain on sale of real estate in the current year. ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company 17 Operating margin decreased 1,190 basis points to 8.1% for fiscal 2019 primarily due to the one-time, non-cash before-tax impairment charge of $8.3 billion for Shave Care. Non-Operating Items ##TABLE_START  Interest expense was $509 million in 2019 , a marginal increase of $3 million versus the prior year due to an increase in average debt balances and an increase in U.S. interest rates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interest income was $220 million in 2019 , a reduction of $27 million versus the prior year due to a reduction in average investment securities balances. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other non-operating income, which consists primarily of divestiture gains, investment income and other non-operating items increased $649 million to $871 million, primarily due to a $355 million before-tax gain from the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership in the current year (discussed earlier in the Recent Developments section) and $346 million of base year charges for the early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by higher minor brand divestiture gains in the base year. ##TABLE_END Income Taxes Income taxes decreased $1.4 billion to $2.1 billion. The effective tax rate increased 870 basis points to 34.7% in 2019. The current year Shave Care impairment charges caused a 1,750 basis-point increase in the effective tax rate, as there is no tax benefit related to the goodwill portion of the impairment. Excluding this impact, the effective tax rate declined 880 basis points, primarily due to the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"U.S. Tax Act\") in December 2017. The U.S. Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rates, but also imposed a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries and caused us to adjust our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal base rate of 21%. These transitional impacts resulted in a provisional net charge of $602 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, comprised of an estimated repatriation tax charge of $3.8 billion (comprised of U.S. repatriation taxes and foreign withholding taxes) and an estimated net deferred tax benefit of $3.2 billion. In addition, because the Company has a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 28% for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and 21% for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and subsequent fiscal years. Combined, these impacts reduced the current year effective tax rate by 950 basis points, consisting of: ##TABLE_START  a 500 basis-point reduction from the impact of the lower blended U.S. federal tax rate on current year earnings versus the prior year rate, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 450 basis-point reduction due to prior year transitional impacts from the U.S. Tax Act. ##TABLE_ENDThe remaining 70 basis point net increase in the current year income tax rate was driven by: ##TABLE_START  a 160 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts of geographic mix of earnings, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 10 basis-point increase from reduced favorable discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (which netted to approximately 15 basis points in the current year versus 25 basis points in the prior year), and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a 100 basis-point reduction from increased excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (160 basis points in the current year versus 60 basis points in the prior year). ##TABLE_END Net Earnings Operating income decreased $7.9 billion , or 59%, primarily due to the $8.3 billion before tax impairment charge for Shave Care. This was partially offset by the net sales increase, along with the marginal increase in gross margin and decrease in SGA spending as a percentage of sales, all of which are discussed above. Earnings before income taxes decreased $7.3 billion or 54% to $6.1 billion, as the reduction in operating income discussed in the preceding paragraph was partially offset by the current year gain from the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership and the base year charges for the early extinguishment of debt, each of which was discussed earlier. Net earnings decreased $5.9 billion, or 60% to $4.0 billion . Net earnings declined less than earnings before income taxes due to the above discussed reduction in income taxes. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $900 million in 2019 due to weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar, including those in Argentina, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, China and the United Kingdom. This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble decreased $5.9 billion , or 60% , to $3.9 billion . Diluted net earnings per share decreased $2.24 , or 61% , to $1.43 due primarily to the reduction in net earnings. Core EPS increased 7% to $4.52 . Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the current year charge for the Shave Care impairment, the current year gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, the base year charges for both the net transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act and for early extinguishment of debt and incremental restructuring charges in both years related to our productivity and cost savings plans. The increase was primarily driven by the lower effective tax rate on core earnings, resulting from the U.S. Tax Act and the net sales increase. 18 The Procter  Gamble Company SEGMENT RESULTS Segment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs. These costs, including the Shave Care impairment in fiscal 2019, are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on items included in the Corporate segment. Eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our consolidated effective tax rate, including the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act in fiscal 2018, are included in Corporate. ##TABLE_START Net Sales Change Drivers 2019 vs. 2018 (1)  Volume with Acquisitions  Divestitures  Volume Excluding Acquisitions  Divestitures  Foreign Exchange  Price  Mix  Other (2)  Net Sales Growth Beauty %  %  (4 )%  %  %  (1 )%  % Grooming (1 )%  (1 )%  (5 )%  %   %  (1 )%  (5 )% Health Care %  %  (3 )%  %  %   %  % Fabric  Home Care %  %  (3 )%  %  %   %  % Baby, Feminine  Family Care %  %  (4 )%  %   %   %  (2 )% TOTAL COMPANY %  %  (4 )%  %  %  (1 )%  % ##TABLE_END(1) Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.

Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced net sales by 4%. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Favorable product mix added 4% to net sales, primarily due to the disproportionate growth of the Skin and Personal Care category, including the super-premium SK-II and premium Olay Skin brands which have higher than segment average selling prices. Organic sales increased 8% . Global market share of the Beauty segment decreased 0.1 points . Volume increased low single digits in both developed and developing regions. ##TABLE_START  Volume in Hair Care increased low single digits . Volume in developed regions increased low single digits due to product innovation and increased distribution. Developing regions volume increased low single digits due to product innovation and market growth.

Excluding the impact of minor brand acquisitions, organic volume increased mid-single digits. Developed regions volume increased mid-single digits . Excluding the impact of minor brand acquisitions, developed regions ##TABLE_ENDvolume was unchanged. Volume increased double digits in developing regions due to premium innovation, continued growth of SK-II, increased marketing spending and market growth. Global market share of the skin and personal care category was unchanged . Net earnings increased 14% to $2.6 billion in 2019 due to the increase in net sales and a 170 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to a reduction in U.S. income tax rates and a decrease in SGA as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin. Gross margin decreased slightly mainly due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. SGA as a percentage of sales decreased primarily due to a reduction in marketing spending driven by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and the impacts of adopting the new accounting standard on \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\". The reduction in the tax rate was due to the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, both from overall rate reduction and the manner in which the impacts were allocated between the business and corporate segments in the prior year, as discussed in the Corporate segment below.

Global market share of the Grooming segment decreased 0.9 points . Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and decreased low single digits in developing regions. ##TABLE_START  Shave Care volume decreased low single digits . Volume increased low single digits in developed regions due to increased competitiveness following price reductions in the prior year and product innovation. Volume in developing regions decreased low single digits due to reduced demand following devaluation related price increases and competitive activity. Global market share of the shave care category decreased half a point . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Appliances volume increased low single digits . Volume increased mid-single digits in developed regions due to innovation and market growth. Volume in developing regions was unchanged. Global market share of the appliances category decreased more than half a point . ##TABLE_END Net earnings increased 7% to $1.5 billion in 2019 due to a 280 basis-point increase in net earnings margin, which more than offset the net sales decrease. The net earnings margin increased primarily due to a reduction in U.S. income tax rates and a reduction in SGA as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin. Gross margin declined due to the negative impact of unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of disposable razors, lower tier products in the Appliances category and large count packs all of which have lower than segment average margins), unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and increased commodity costs, partially offset by the positive impacts of manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing. SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased due to a current year gain on the sale of operating real estate, reductions in overhead costs and marketing spending and the impacts from adoption of the new accounting standard on \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\". The reduction in the tax rate was primarily due to the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, both from the overall rate reduction and the manner in which the impacts were allocated between the business and corporate segments in the prior year, as discussed in the Corporate segment below.

Net earnings margin increased due to a decrease in U.S. income tax rates, partially offset by a reduction in gross margin. Gross margin decreased due to unfavorable mix impact (from the disproportionate growth of club channel and products with lower than segment-average margins, partially offset by the net impacts of the acquisition and dissolution in personal health care) and increases in commodity costs, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and positive pricing impacts. SGA as a percentage of net sales was unchanged as an increase in overhead costs was offset by a reduction in marketing spending. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased due to the net impacts of the personal health care acquisition and dissolution, including both integration-related spending and higher relative levels of selling costs in the acquired business, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales declined primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and the impacts from adoption of the new accounting standard on \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\". The reduction in the tax rate was due to the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, both from the overall rate reduction and the manner in which the impacts were allocated between the business and corporate segments in the prior year, as discussed in the Corporate segment below. 20 The Procter  Gamble Company FABRIC  HOME CARE ##TABLE_START ($ millions)   Change vs. 2018 Volume N/A  N/A  4% Net sales $22,080  $21,441  3% Net earnings $3,518  $2,708  30% % of net sales 15.9%  12.6%  330 bps ##TABLE_ENDFabric  Home Care net sales increased 3% to $22.1 billion in 2019 on a 4% increase in unit volume .

Net earnings margin increased due to a decrease in U.S. income tax rates and a reduction in SGA as a percentage of sales partially offset by a marginal reduction in gross margin. Gross margin decreased due to unfavorable product mix (driven by the disproportionate growth of large sizes and club channel, both of which have lower than average margins, and new innovation with higher than segment-average product costs), unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and increased commodity costs, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing. SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased due to reductions in both overhead costs and marketing spending, driven by productivity savings, fixed cost leverage from increased net sales and the impacts from adoption of the new accounting standard on \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\". The reduction in the tax rate was due to the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, both from the overall rate reduction and the manner in which the impacts were allocated between the business and corporate segments in the prior year, as discussed in the Corporate segment below.

Net earnings margin increased primarily due to a reduction in U.S. income tax rates and a decrease in SGA as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a marginal decrease in gross margin. The gross margin decrease was driven by an increase in commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing. SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased due to reduced marketing spending and overhead costs, driven by productivity savings and the impacts from adoption of the new accounting standard on \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\".

The Procter  Gamble Company 21 CORPORATE ##TABLE_START ($ millions)   Change vs. 2018 Net sales $484  $497  (3)% Net earnings/(loss) $(7,971)  $(133)  N/A ##TABLE_ENDCorporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; certain asset impairment charges; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. For 2018, the tax impact also includes the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, which were included in the corporate segment. Corporate net sales decreased 3% to $484 million in 2019 due to a decrease in the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net loss increased by $7.8 billion in 2019 primarily due to the $8.0 billion after tax ($8.3 billion before tax) charge for the Shave Care impairment as well as the impact of the allocation methodology of the lower U.S. Tax rates. The U.S. Tax Act was enacted in the middle of fiscal 2018; therefore, the net benefit was held in Corporate. Beginning in fiscal 2019, the lower rates are included in the reporting segments. These impacts were partially offset by the following benefits, each of which was discussed earlier: ##TABLE_START  the base period net charge for the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the base period loss on early debt extinguishment, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  lower restructuring charges in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  higher current year divestiture gains (primarily driven by gain on the dissolution of the PGT healthcare partnership) ##TABLE_END Restructuring Program to deliver Productivity and Cost Savings In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings program. The current productivity and cost savings plan will further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. As part of this plan, the Company incurred approximately $1.8 billion in total before- tax restructuring costs across 2018 and 2019, with an additional amount of approximately $0.6 billion expected in 2020. This program is expected to result in additional enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Savings generated from restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. However, we estimate that through 2019, the underlying restructuring costs incurred since 2012 (approximately $7.4 billion), along with other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions since 2012 have delivered approximately $3.6 billion in annual before-tax gross savings. Restructuring accruals of $468 million as of June 30, 2019 are classified as current liabilities. Approximately 67% of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2019 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program and to the Operating Costs section of the MDA for more information about the total benefit to operating margins from our total savings efforts. CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations. Operating Cash Flow Operating cash flow was $15.2 billion in 2019 , a 3% increase from the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes, gain on sale of assets and goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges) generated approximately $14.6 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts generated $0.7 billion of operating cash flow as summarized below. ##TABLE_START  An increase in accounts receivable used $276 million of cash due to increased sales and the timing of the end of the fiscal year (which fell on a weekend, resulting in fewer ##TABLE_END22 The Procter  Gamble Company days collection). The number of days sales outstanding increased approximately one day versus prior year. ##TABLE_START  Higher inventory used $239 million of cash mainly due to inventory increases to support initiatives and business growth across all segments. Inventory days on hand increased approximately 2 days primarily due to initiative support and foreign exchange impacts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $1.9 billion of cash. This was primarily driven by extended payment terms with our suppliers and an increase in fourth quarter marketing activity versus the prior year. These factors, along with foreign exchange, drove an approximate 8 day increase in days payable outstanding. Although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics, we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers could decline in fiscal 2020. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other operating assets and liabilities used $1.0 billion of cash, primarily driven by the payment of the current year portion of taxes due related to the U.S. Tax Act repatriation charge and statutory pension contributions. ##TABLE_END Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act, and it is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow was $12.1 billion in 2019 , an increase of 9% versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating cash flows as discussed above. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, excluding the Shave Care impairment charges and the gain on dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, was 105% in 2019 . Investing Cash Flow Net investing activities consumed $3.5 billion in cash in 2019 , mainly due to capital spending and business acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.3 billion in 2019 , a decrease of 10% versus prior year. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 70 basis points to 4.9% in 2019 . Acquisitions. Acquisition activity used cash of $3.9 billion in 2019 , primarily related to the Merck OTC acquisition. Acquisition activity used $109 million in 2018 , primarily related to acquisitions in the Beauty segment. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales were $394 million in 2019 primarily from minor brand divestitures and the sale of real estate. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $269 million in cash in 2018 primarily from minor brand divestitures. Short-term investments. Short-term investments generated net cash of $3.5 billion in 2019, primarily from sales and maturities of available-for-sale investments. Net cash flow from short-term investments was not material in 2018. Financing Cash Flow Net financing activities consumed $10.0 billion in cash in 2019 , mainly due to dividends to shareholders and treasury stock purchases, partially offset by the impact of stock options. Dividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 4% to $2.90 per share in 2019 . Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $7.5 billion in 2019 and $7.3 billion in 2018 . In April 2019, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.7172 to $0.7459 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This represents a 4% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 63rd consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend for 129 consecutive years, every year since our incorporation in 1890. Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $30.1 billion as of June 30, 2019 and $31.3 billion as of June 30, 2018 . Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $5.0 billion in 2019 and $7.0 billion in 2018 . Liquidity At June 30, 2019 , our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $7.5 billion , largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2019 , $5.7 billion of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was related to foreign subsidiaries, primarily various Western European and Asian countries. Under current law, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. As of June 30, 2019 , we did not have material cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds. We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. On June 30, 2019 , our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard  Poor's), while our long-term The Procter  Gamble Company 23 credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard  Poor's), all with a stable outlook. We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion four-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2022 and November 2019, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. For additional details on debt see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity. Contractual Commitments The following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2019 . ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions Total  Less Than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  After 5 Years RECORDED LIABILITIES          Total debt $ 29,988  $ 9,695  $ 4,791  $ 4,807  $ 10,695 Capital leases     U.S. Tax Act transitional charge (1) 2,557     1,248 Uncertain tax positions (2)        OTHER          Interest payments relating to long-term debt 4,682     2,394 Operating leases 1,218     Minimum pension funding (3)       Purchase obligations (4) 1,491     TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS $ 40,583  $ 11,674  $ 7,324  $ 6,690  $ 14,895 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Represents the U.S. federal tax liability associated with the repatriation provisions of the U.S. Tax Act. Does not include any provisions made for foreign withholding taxes on expected repatriations as the timing of those payments is uncertain. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  As of June 30, 2019 , the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $617 million, including $150 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2019 , cannot be made. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2022 are not currently determinable. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent minimum commitments under take-or-pay agreements with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position. ##TABLE_END SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition 24 The Procter  Gamble Company Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities, and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on contractual terms, sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates. The actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates. These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) on July 1, 2018. Adoption of this standard resulted in a change in the timing of recognition of certain trade promotional spending. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions. Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized. We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. A core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities. However, because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border transactions. We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty. We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the Company's income taxes. Employee Benefits We sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits. The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2019 , the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets was 6.6% and 8.3%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $115 million. Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts The Procter  Gamble Company 25 of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 1.9% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $200 million. The average discount rate on the OPEB plan of 3.7% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where a majority of the plan participants receive benefits. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $60 million. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statement for additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations. We typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the income method, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. The valuations used to establish and to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin progression, Company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized, but are tested at least annually for impairment. Our ongoing annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the 3 months ended December 31. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. For example, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. In addition, changes to, or a failure to achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates, leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses. We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two step process. In the first step (step one), we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step (step two) to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. The second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination. The difference between the step one fair value and the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities in step two is the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. If this implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, all customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high. The Appliances wholly-acquired reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value. As previously disclosed, the fair value of the Shave Care reporting unit and the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset have been reduced during the recent year to amounts that approximated carrying value. The fair value reductions were due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar, a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits, primarily in the developed markets, and an increased competitive market environment in the U.S. and certain other markets, which collectively have resulted in reduced cash flow projections. The business continued to be impacted by these factors during the quarter ended June 30, 2019, which reduced previous estimates of earnings for both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. Because of this, we re-performed our step one impairment tests for these assets as of June 30, 2019 and determined that the fair values have been reduced below their respective carrying values. Therefore, we conducted a step two test of goodwill for the Shave Care reporting unit. Step two requires that we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to identifiable assets and 26 The Procter  Gamble Company liabilities of the reporting unit, including previously amortized or unrecognized intangible assets. Any residual fair value after this allocation is compared to the goodwill balance and any excess goodwill is charged to expense. The step two test resulted in an implied fair value of the Shave Care goodwill that was below the carrying value. Therefore, we recognized a non-cash before and after-tax impairment charge of $6.8 billion . The resulting carrying value of the Shave Care goodwill is $12.6 billion as of June 30, 2019 . As a result of the methodology used in the step two testing, the Shave Care fair value now exceeds the carrying value by approximately 20% . This is primarily due to higher estimated fair values for certain fixed assets and defined lived intangibles assets, both of which have been partially amortized subsequent to their initial acquisition, along with fair values assigned to intangible assets not eligible for recognition in the financial statements. The Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge was $1.6 billion ( $1.2 billion after tax). This charge was equal to the difference between its estimated fair value (as calculated in step one) and its carrying value. The resulting carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is $14.1 billion as of June 30, 2019 , which is equal to its estimated fair value. As a result, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is more susceptible to future impairment risk. The Shave Care goodwill and Gillette indefinite-lived asset impairment charges are presented as a separate line item in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Irrespective of these impairment charges, the Shave Care business has consistently generated significant earnings and cash flow and will continue to be a strategic business for the Company, with attractive earnings, cash flow and growth opportunities. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and discount rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period and approximates expected long term category market growth rates. The net sales and earnings growth rates are dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates, business activities that impact market share and input cost fluctuations. As a result, these growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, an increased competitive environment, increases in input costs or devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. The table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter term and residual growth rates and the discount rate, to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis point increase to discount rate or a 25 basis point decrease to our shorter-term and residual growth rates, both of which would result in incremental impairment charges to the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. ##TABLE_START  Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value  +25 bps Discount Rate  -25 bps Growth Rate Shave Care goodwill reporting unit (5)%  (6)% Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset (5)%  (5)% ##TABLE_ENDSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing results. New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of June 30, 2019 . OTHER INFORMATION Hedging and Derivative Financial Instruments As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. We leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility within our financing operations, as discussed below, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the RiskManager value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates The Procter  Gamble Company 27 the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics dataset as of June 30, 2019 . In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics, a reasonable proxy is included. Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term. Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments. Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2019 , including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements. Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months. Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2019 , we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements. Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures. As of and during the years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 , we did not have any commodity hedging activity. Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e. trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. These measures include: Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of the July 1, 2018 adoption of new accounting standards for \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\", acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. The impact of the adoption of the new accounting standard for Revenue from Contracts with Customers is driven by the prospective reclassification of certain customer spending from marketing (SGA) expense to a reduction of net sales. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis, and this measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth: ##TABLE_START Year ended June 30, 2019 Net Sales Growth Foreign Exchange Impact Acquisition  Divestiture Impact/Other (1) Organic Sales Growth Beauty % %  % % Grooming (5 )% % % % Health Care % % (2 )% % Fabric  Home Care % % % % Baby, Feminine  Family Care (2 )% %  % % TOTAL COMPANY % %  % % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Acquisition  Divestiture Impact/Other includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the impact from the July 1, 2018 adoption of a new accounting standard for \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. ##TABLE_END Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding certain tax payments related to the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act (the Company incurred a transitional tax liability of approximately $3.8 billion from the U.S. Tax Act, which is payable over a period of 8 years). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate 28 The Procter  Gamble Company after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions): ##TABLE_START  Operating Cash Flow Capital Spending Adjustments to Operating Cash Flow (1) Adjusted Free Cash Flow $ 15,242 $ (3,347 ) $ $ 12,130 $ 14,867 $ (3,717 ) $  $ 11,150 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Adjustments to Operating Cash Flow relate to tax payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. ##TABLE_END Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding 1) the fiscal 2019 Shave Care impairment and 2) the fiscal 2019 gain on dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand PGs ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions): ##TABLE_START  Net Earnings Adjustments to Net Earnings (1) Net Earnings Excluding Adjustments Adjusted Free Cash Flow Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity $ 3,966 $ 7,625 $ 11,591 $ 12,130 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Adjustments to Net Earnings relate to the Shave Care impairment charges and the gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership in fiscal 2019. ##TABLE_ENDCore EPS. Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. Core EPS is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The table below provides a reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS, including the following reconciling items: ##TABLE_START  Incremental Restructuring : The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. In 2012, the Company began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities. In 2017, we communicated details of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Gain on Dissolution of the PGT Healthcare Partnership: The Company dissolved our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, Ltd (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business, during the year ended June 30, 2019. The transaction was accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the PGT business; the Company recognized an after-tax gain on the dissolution of $353 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Transitional Impacts of the U.S. Tax Act : As discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the U.S. Tax Act) in December 2017. This resulted in a net charge of $602 million for the fiscal year 2018. The adjustment to core earnings only includes this transitional impact. It does not include the ongoing impacts of the lower U.S. statutory rate on pre-tax earnings. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Early debt extinguishment charges : In fiscal 2018, the Company recorded after-tax charges of $243 million, due to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. These charges represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Shave Care Impairment : As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates section of the MDA, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company recognized a one-time, non-cash after-tax charge of $8.0 billion ($8.3 billion before tax) to adjust the carrying values of the Shave Care reporting unit. This was comprised of a before and after-tax impairment charge of $6.8 billion related to goodwill and an after-tax impairment charge of $1.2 billion ($1.6 billion before tax) to reduce the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible assets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Anti-Dilutive Impacts: As discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Shave Care impairment charges caused preferred shares that are normally dilutive (and hence, normally assumed converted for purposes of determining diluted earnings per share) to be anti-dilutive. Accordingly for U.S. GAAP, the preferred shares were not assumed to be converted into common shares for diluted earnings per share and the related dividends paid to the preferred shareholders were deducted from net income to calculate earnings available to common shareholders. As a result of the non-GAAP Shave Care impairment adjustment, these instruments are dilutive for non-GAAP core earnings per share. ##TABLE_END We do not view the above items to be indicative of underlying business results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

Excluding the impairment charge results in higher non-GAAP earnings which causes the preferred shares to be dilutive. The adjustments in this row are made to reflect the dilutive preferred share impact resulting from the Shave Care impairment adjustment.  ##TABLE_START  CHANGE VERSUS YEAR AGO    CORE EPS %  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START THE PROCTER  GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2018  AS REPORTED (GAAP)  INCREMENTAL RESTRUCTURING  TRANSITIONAL IMPACTS OF THE U.S. TAX ACT  EARLY DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT  ROUNDING  NON-GAAP (CORE) COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD $ 34,432  $ (724 )  $   $   $ (1 )  $ 33,707 SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 19,037  (1 )       19,037 OPERATING INCOME 13,363         14,088 INCOME TAX ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS 3,465   (602 )     3,095 NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PG 9,750     (1 )  11,204            Core EPS DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE* $ 3.67  $ 0.23  $ 0.23  $ 0.09  $   $ 4.22 ##TABLE_END* Diluted net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of The Procter  Gamble Company (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Strong internal controls is an objective that is reinforced through our Worldwide Business Conduct Manual , which sets forth our commitment to conduct business with integrity, and within both the letter and the spirit of the law. Our people are deeply committed to our Purpose, Values, and Principles, which unite us in doing whats right. Our system of internal controls includes written policies and procedures, segregation of duties, and the careful selection and development of employees. Additional key elements of our internal control structure include our Global Leadership Council, which is actively involved in oversight of the business strategies, initiatives, results and controls, our Disclosure Committee, which is responsible for evaluating disclosure implications of significant business activities and events, our Board of Directors, which provides strong and effective corporate governance, and our Audit Committee, which reviews significant accounting policies, financial reporting and internal control matters. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes a Control Self-Assessment Program that is conducted annually for critical financial reporting areas of the Company and is audited by our Global Internal Audit organization. Management takes the appropriate action to correct any identified control deficiencies. Global Internal Audit also performs financial and compliance audits around the world, provides training, and continuously improves our internal control processes. Because of its inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, may not prevent or detect misstatements due to the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden or that misstatements due to error or fraud may occur that are not detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2019 , using criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2019 , based on these criteria. Deloitte  Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2019 , as stated in their report which is included herein. ##TABLE_START /s/ David S. Taylor David S. Taylor Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer  /s/ Jon R. Moeller Jon R. Moeller Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer  August 6, 2019 ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company 31 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Procter  Gamble Company Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Shareholders Equity and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2019 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 6, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for revenue from contracts with customers in the year ended June 30, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. ##TABLE_START Goodwill and Intangible Assets - Shave Care Goodwill and Gillette Indefinite Lived Intangible Asset - Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Companys evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates fair value using the income method, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. This requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future net sales and earnings, including growth rates beyond a 10-year time period, royalty rates and discount rates. Changes in the assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any impairment charge, or both. The Company performed their annual impairment assessments of the Shave Care reporting unit as of October 1, 2018 and the Gillette brand indefinite-lived intangible asset (the Gillette brand) as of December 31, 2018. Because the estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values, no impairments were recorded. Given recent reductions in cash flows caused by currency devaluations, changing consumer grooming habits affecting demand and an increase in the competitive market environment, the Company revised their cash flow estimates and ##TABLE_END32 The Procter  Gamble Company ##TABLE_START  updated their fair value estimates for both the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette brand as of June 30, 2019 and determined the carrying values exceeded the fair values resulting in an impairment of the Shave Care Goodwill and the Gillette brand. The Company measured the impairment of goodwill using the two-step method which requires management to make significant estimates and judgments to allocate the fair value of the Shave Care reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities including estimating the fair value of property, plant and equipment and intangibles. The residual fair value of the Shave Care reporting unit was compared to the carrying value of its goodwill with the excess in carrying value of $6.8 billion before and after tax recorded as an impairment. The impairment of the Gillette brand of $1.6 billion before tax and $1.2 billion after tax was measured as the difference between its fair value and carrying value. As of June 30, 2019, after recording of the impairments, the Shave Care reporting unit goodwill was $12.6 billion, and the Gillette brand was $14.1 billion. We identified the Companys impairment evaluations of goodwill for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette brand as a critical audit matter because of the recent reductions in cash flows and the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair values of the reporting unit and the brand and to estimate the fair value of the reporting units assets and liabilities for purposes of measuring the impairment of goodwill. A high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort was required when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of managements estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of future net sales and earnings as well as the selection of royalty rates and discount rates and the estimation and allocation of fair value to the reporting units assets and liabilities including the need to involve our fair value specialists.    How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to forecasts of future net sales and earnings and the selection of the royalty rates and discount rates for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette brand included the following, among others:  We tested the effectiveness of controls over goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, including those over the determination of fair value, such as controls related to managements development of forecasts of future net sales, earnings, the selection of royalty rates, discount rates and allocation of the reporting unit fair value to its identifiable assets and liabilities.  We evaluated managements ability to accurately forecast net sales and earnings by comparing actual results to managements historical forecasts.  We evaluated the reasonableness of managements forecast of net sales and earnings by comparing the forecasts to:  Historical net sales and earnings.  Underlying analysis detailing business strategies and growth plans.  Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors.  Forecasted information included in Company press releases as well as in analyst and industry reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies.  With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology, net sales and earnings growth rates, royalty rates, discount rates and estimation and allocation of the reporting unit fair value to its identifiable assets and liabilities by:  Testing the source information underlying the determination of net sales and earnings growth rates, royalty rates, discount rates, estimation and allocation of the reporting unit fair value to its identifiable assets and liabilities and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.  Developing a range of independent estimates for the discount rates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management.    Acquisition of the over the counter healthcare business of Merck KGaA - Refer to Note 14 to the financial statements   Critical Audit Matter Description The Company completed the acquisition of the over the counter healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) for $3.7 billion on November 30, 2018. The Company accounted for this transaction under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated, on a preliminary basis, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including identified intangible assets of $2.1 billion and resulting goodwill of $2.1 billion. Of the identified intangible assets acquired, the most significant included brand indefinite lived intangible assets of $946 million and brand defined life intangible assets of $701 million (the brand intangible assets). The Company estimated the fair value of the brand intangible assets using the royalty savings method, which is a specific discounted cash flow method that required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to future cash flows and the selection of royalty rates and discount rates. ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company 33 ##TABLE_START We identified the brand intangible assets for Merck OTC as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management makes to fair value these assets for purposes of recording the acquisition. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of managements forecasts of future cash flows as well as the selection of the royalty rates and discount rates, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the forecasts of future cash flows and the selection of the royalty rates and discount rates for the brand intangible assets included the following, among others:  We tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of the brand intangible assets, including managements controls over forecasts of future cash flows and selection of the royalty rates and discount rates.  We evaluated the reasonableness of managements forecasts of future cash flows by comparing the projections to historical results and certain peer companies.  With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology, royalty rates and discount rates by:  Testing the source information underlying the determination of the royalty rates and discount rates and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.  Developing a range of independent estimates for the discount rates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP Cincinnati, Ohio  August 6, 2019  We have served as the Companys auditor since 1890. ##TABLE_END34 The Procter  Gamble Company REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Procter  Gamble Company Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Procter  Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2019, of the Company and our report dated August 6, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph related to the Companys change in method of accounting for revenue from contracts with customers in the year ended June 30, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. ##TABLE_START /s/ Deloitte  Touche LLP Cincinnati, Ohio  August 6, 2019 ##TABLE_ENDThe Procter  Gamble Company 35 Consolidated Statements of Earnings ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions except per share amounts; Years ended June 30   NET SALES $ 67,684  $ 66,832  $ 65,058 Cost of products sold 34,768  34,432  32,638 Selling, general and administrative expense 19,084  19,037  18,654 Goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles impairment charges 8,345     OPERATING INCOME 5,487  13,363  13,766 Interest expense   Interest income   Other non-operating income/(expense), net   ( 215 ) EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 6,069  13,326  13,257 Income taxes on continuing operations 2,103  3,465  3,063 NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS 3,966  9,861  10,194 NET EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS     5,217 NET EARNINGS 3,966  9,861  15,411 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests   NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER  GAMBLE $ 3,897  $ 9,750  $ 15,326       BASIC NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: (1)      Earnings from continuing operations $ 1.45  $ 3.75  $ 3.79 Earnings from discontinued operations     2.01 BASIC NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE $ 1.45  $ 3.75  $ 5.80 DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: (1)      Earnings from continuing operations $ 1.43  $ 3.67  $ 3.69 Earnings from discontinued operations     1.90 DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE $ 1.43  $ 3.67  $ 5.59 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Basic net earnings per common share and Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble. ##TABLE_END See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 36 The Procter  Gamble Company Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions; Years ended June 30   NET EARNINGS $ 3,966  $ 9,861  $ 15,411 OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS), NET OF TAX      Foreign currency translation (net of $78, $(279) and $(186) tax, respectively) ( 213 )  ( 305 )  ( 67 ) Unrealized gains/(losses) on investment securities (net of $0 , $0 and $(6) tax, respectively)  ( 148 )  ( 59 ) Unrealized gains on defined benefit retirement plans (net of $22 , $68 and $551 tax, respectively)   1,401 TOTAL OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS), NET OF TAX  ( 119 )  1,275 TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME 4,106  9,742  16,686 Less: Total comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests   TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER  GAMBLE $ 4,036  $ 9,633  $ 16,601 ##TABLE_ENDSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated. Because of a lack of control over Venezuela subsidiaries caused by a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not consolidated for any year presented. We account for those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. Use of Estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, consumer and trade promotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, post-employment benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax positions and contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although management does not generally believe such differences would materially affect the financial statements in any individual year. However, in regard to ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those anticipated at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that materially affect the financial statements in a given year. Revenue Recognition Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period the revenue is recognized. The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. The revenue includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to the customer. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in the Accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacturing of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product. Cost of products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense (SGA) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items. Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $ 1.9 billion in 2019 , $ 1.9 billion in 2018 and $ 1.9 billion in 2017 (reported in Net earnings from continuing operations). Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include worldwide television, print, radio, internet and in-store advertising expenses and were $ 6.8 billion in 2019 , $ 7.1 billion in 2018 and $ 7.1 billion in 2017 (reported in Net earnings from continuing operations). Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending reported in SGA include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids. Other Non-Operating Income/(Expense), Net Other non-operating income/(expense), net primarily includes net acquisition and divestiture gains, non-service components of net defined benefit costs, investment income and other non-operating items. Currency Translation Financial statements of operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in Other comprehensive income (OCI). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Re-measurement adjustments for financial statements in highly inflationary economies and other transactional exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 41 Cash Flow Presentation The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method, which reconciles net earnings to cash flow from operating activities. Cash flows from foreign currency transactions and operations are translated at an average exchange rate for the period. Cash flows from hedging activities are included in the same category as the items being hedged. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as financing activities. Realized gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative instruments used to hedge currency exposures resulting from intercompany financing transactions are also classified as financing activities. Cash flows from other derivative instruments used to manage interest rates, commodity or other currency exposures are classified as operating activities. Cash payments related to income taxes are classified as operating activities. Cash flows from the Company's discontinued operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 13 for significant cash flow items related to discontinued operations. Investments Investment securities primarily consist of readily marketable debt securities. Unrealized gains or losses from investments classified as trading, if any, are charged to earnings. Unrealized gains or losses on debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded in OCI. If an available-for-sale security is other than temporarily impaired, the loss is charged to either earnings or OCI depending on our intent and ability to retain the security until we recover the full cost basis and the extent of the loss attributable to the creditworthiness of the issuer. Investment securities are included as Available-for-sale investment securities and Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Investments in certain companies over which we exert significant influence, but do not control the financial and operating decisions, are accounted for as equity method investments. Other investments that are not controlled, and over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method. Both equity and cost method investments are included as Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value. Product-related inventories are maintained on the first-in, first-out method. The cost of spare part inventories is maintained using the average-cost method. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized over the assets' estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Machinery and equipment includes office furniture and fixtures ( 15 -year life), computer equipment and capitalized software ( 3 - to 5 -year lives) and manufacturing equipment ( 3 - to 20 -year lives). Buildings are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 40 years. Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, when appropriate, changes are made prospectively. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. Our annual impairment testing of goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. We have acquired brands that have been determined to have indefinite lives. Those assets are evaluated annually for impairment. We evaluate a number of factors to determine whether an indefinite life is appropriate, including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. In addition, when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an additional impairment assessment is performed and indefinite-lived assets may be adjusted to a determinable life. The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology and other intangible assets with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives. Customer relationships, brands and other non-contractual intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over periods generally ranging from 5 to 30 years. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and remaining lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted. For additional details on goodwill and intangible assets see Note 4. Fair Values of Financial Instruments Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Changes in assumptions or estimation methods could affect the fair value estimates; however, we do not believe any such changes would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, certain investments and short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair values of long-term debt and financial instruments are disclosed in Note 9. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies On July 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).\" This guidance outlines a single, comprehensive model of accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective transition method, under which prior periods were not revised to reflect the impacts of the new standard. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single delivery element and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer. Accordingly, the timing of revenue recognition is not Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 42 The Procter  Gamble Company materially impacted by the new standard. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities, and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. The adoption of the new standard accelerated the accrual timing for certain portions of our customer and consumer promotional spending, which resulted in a cumulative reduction to Retained earnings of $ 534 , net of tax, on the date of adoption. The provisions of the new standard also impact the classification of certain payments to customers, moving such payments from expense to a deduction from net sales. Had this standard been effective and adopted during fiscal 2018, the impact would have been to reclassify $ 309 for the year ended June 30, 2018, with no impact to operating income. We elected certain practical expedients included in the guidance related to shipping and handling costs, which was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. This new guidance does not have any other material impacts on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including financial disclosures. On July 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-07, \"Compensation-Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (Topic 715).\" This guidance requires an entity to disaggregate the current service cost component from the other components of net benefit costs in the face of the income statement. It requires the service cost component to be presented with other current compensation costs for the related employees in the operating section of the income statement, with other components of net benefit cost presented outside of income from operations. We adopted the standard retrospectively, using the practical expedient which allows entities to use information previously disclosed in their pension and other postretirement benefit plans footnote as the basis to apply the retrospective presentation requirements. As such, prior periods results have been revised to report the other components of net defined benefit costs, previously reported in Cost of products sold and SGA, in Other non-operating income, net. On July 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-18, \"Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash (Topic 230).\" This guidance requires the Statement of Cash Flows to present changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. Prior to the adoption of this ASU, the relevant accounting guidance did not require the Statement of Cash Flows to include changes in restricted cash. We currently have no significant restricted cash balances. Historically, we had restricted cash balances and changes related to divestiture activity. Such balances were presented as Current assets held for sale on the balance sheets, with changes presented as Investing activities on the Statements of Cash Flow. In accordance with ASU 2016-08, such balances are now included in the beginning and ending balances of Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for all periods presented. On July 1, 2018, we early adopted ASU 2018-02, \"Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Topic 220).\" This guidance permits companies to make an election to reclassify stranded tax effects from the recently enacted U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) to Retained earnings. ASU 2018-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The reclassification from the adoption of this standard resulted in an increase of $ 326 to Retained earnings and a decrease of $ 326 to AOCI. On July 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-16, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity transfers of Assets other than Inventory.\" We adopted this standard on a modified retrospective basis. The standard eliminates the prohibition in ASC 740 against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The adoption of ASU 2016-16 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the cumulative effect adjustment required upon adoption. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842).\" The standard requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements. The updated guidance provides an optional transition method, which allows for the application of the standard as of the adoption date with no restatement of prior period amounts. We plan to adopt the standard on July 1, 2019 under the optional transition method described above. We are currently in the process of implementing lease accounting software as well as assessing the impact that the new standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of the standard will consist primarily of a balance sheet gross up of our operating leases to show equal and offsetting lease assets and lease liabilities. Subject to the completion of our assessment, we expect the adoption of the standard to result in an increase to our total assets of approximately 1 % . In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, \"Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\" The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring a goodwill impairment to be measured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety. This eliminates the second step of the current impairment model that requires companies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit and measure impairments based on those fair values and a residual measurement approach. It also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We will adopt the standard no later than July 1, 2020. The impact of the new standard will be dependent on the specific facts and circumstances of future individual impairments, if any. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Procter  Gamble Company 43 NOTE 2 SEGMENT INFORMATION During fiscal 2017, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories, comprised of 43 of its beauty brands. The transactions included the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and the fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. This business is reported as discontinued operations for the year ended June 30, 2017 (see Note 13). Under U.S. GAAP, our Global Business Units (GBUs) are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty , 2) Grooming , 3) Health Care , 4) Fabric  Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine  Family Care . Our five reportable segments are comprised of: ##TABLE_START  Beauty : Hair Care (Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Grooming : Shave Care (Female Blades  Razors, Male Blades  Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care); Appliances ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Health Care : Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fabric  Home Care : Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, PG Professional, Surface Care); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Baby, Feminine  Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper). ##TABLE_END While none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components within certain reportable segments, such as Appliances (Grooming) and Personal Health Care (Health), are seasonal. The accounting policies of the segments are generally the same as those described in Note 1. Differences between these policies and U.S. GAAP primarily reflect income taxes, which are reflected in the segments using applicable blended statutory rates. Adjustments to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate, including the impacts from the U.S. Tax Act in fiscal 2018 (see Note 5). Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities that are not reflected in the operating results used internally to measure and evaluate the businesses, as well as items to adjust management reporting principles to U.S. GAAP. Operating activities in Corporate include the results of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Operating elements also include certain employee benefit costs, the costs of certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization, certain significant asset impairment charges and other general Corporate items. The non-operating elements in Corporate primarily include interest expense, certain pension and other postretirement benefit costs, certain acquisition and divestiture gains, interest and investing income and other financing costs. Total assets for the reportable segments include those assets managed by the reportable segment, primarily inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets. Other assets, primarily cash, accounts receivable, investment securities and goodwill, are included in Corporate. Our business units are comprised of similar product categories. Nine business units individually accounted for 5% or more of consolidated net sales as follows: ##TABLE_START % of Sales by Business Unit (1) Years ended June 30   Fabric Care 22 %  22 %  22 % Baby Care 12 %  13 %  14 % Hair Care 10 %  10 %  10 % Home Care 10 %  10 %  10 % Skin and Personal Care 10 %  9 %  8 % Family Care 9 %  8 %  8 % Oral Care 8 %  8 %  8 % Shave Care 8 %  8 %  9 % Feminine Care 6 %  6 %  6 % All Other 5 %  6 %  5 % TOTAL 100 %  100 %  100 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  % of sales by business unit excludes sales held in Corporate. ##TABLE_END Net sales and long-lived assets in the United States and internationally were as follows (in billions): ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30    NET SALES       United States  $ 28.6  $ 27.3  $ 27.3 International  $ 39.1  $ 39.5  $ 37.8 LONG-LIVED ASSETS (1)       United States  $ 10.0  $ 9.7  $ 8.8 International  $ 11.3  $ 10.9  $ 11.1 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Long-lived assets consists of property, plant and equipment. ##TABLE_END No other country's net sales or long-lived assets exceed 10% of the Company totals. Our largest customer, Walmart Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for consolidated net sales of approximately 15 % , 15 % and 16 % in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. No other customer represents more than 10% of our consolidated net sales.

The Procter  Gamble Company 45 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $ 250 to $ 500 annually. In fiscal 2012, the Company initiated an incremental restructuring program (covering fiscal 2012 through 2017) as part of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing activities and overhead expenses. The productivity and cost savings plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the Company's growth strategy. In fiscal 2017 the Company announced specific elements of another incremental multi-year productivity and cost savings plan to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. This program is expected to result in incremental enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs. The Company incurred total restructuring charges of $ 754 and $ 1,070 for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Of the charges incurred for fiscal year 2019, $ 213 were recorded in SGA, $ 521 in Costs of products sold, and $ 20 in Other non-operating income/(expense), net. Of the charges incurred for fiscal year 2018, $ 237 were recorded in SGA, $ 819 in Costs of products sold, and $ 14 in Other non-operating income/(expense), net. The following table presents restructuring activity for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 : ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions Separations Asset-Related Costs Other Total RESERVE JUNE 30, 2017 $ $  $ $ Charges 366 1,070 Cash spent ( 279 )  ( 189 ) ( 468 ) Charges against assets  ( 366 )  ( 366 ) RESERVE JUNE 30, 2018  513 Charges 252 754 Cash spent ( 239 )  ( 308 ) ( 547 ) Charges against assets  ( 252 )  ( 252 ) RESERVE JUNE 30, 2019 $ $  $ $ ##TABLE_ENDSeparation Costs Employee separation charges for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 relate to severance packages for approximately 1,810 and 2,720 employees, respectively. The packages were primarily voluntary and the amounts were calculated based on salary levels and past service periods. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Asset-Related Costs Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal. These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other Costs Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program. Such charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain optimization. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges are funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting. Accordingly, all of the charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment. However, for informative purposes, the following table summarizes the total restructuring costs related to our reportable segments: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30 2018 Beauty $ $ $ Grooming 38 Health Care 21 Fabric  Home Care 115 Baby, Feminine  Family Care 547 Corporate (1) 289 Total Company $ $ 1,070 $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Corporate includes costs related to allocated overheads, including charges related to our Sales and Market Operations, Global Business Services and Corporate Functions activities, along with costs related to discontinued operations from our Beauty Brands business in 2017. ##TABLE_ENDAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 46 The Procter  Gamble Company NOTE 4 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS The change in the net carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment was as follows: ##TABLE_START  Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric  Home Care Baby, Feminine  Family Care Corporate Total Company Balance at June 30, 2017 - Net (1) $ 12,791 $ 19,627 $ 5,878 $ 1,857 $ 4,546 $  $ 44,699 Acquisitions and divestitures      Translation and other 193 8  Balance at June 30, 2018 - Net (1) 12,992 19,820 5,929 1,865 4,569  45,175 Acquisitions and divestitures  2,084 57  2,279 Goodwill impairment charges  ( 6,783 )     ( 6,783 ) Translation and other ( 139 ) ( 156 ) ( 41 ) ( 16 ) ( 46 )  ( 398 ) Balance at June 30, 2019 - Net (1) $ 12,985 $ 12,881 $ 7,972 $ 1,855 $ 4,580 $  $ 40,273 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Grooming goodwill balance is net of $1.2 billion accumulated impairment losses as of June 30, 2017 and 2018 and $ 7.9 billion as of June 30, 2019. ##TABLE_END Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting units and underlying indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying values. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability). Estimates utilized in the projected cash flows include consideration of macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion, Company business plans, the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. During fiscal 2019, we determined that the estimated fair value of our Shave Care reporting unit was less than its carrying value. Therefore, we conducted step two of the goodwill impairment test. Step two requires that we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including previously unrecognized intangible assets. Any residual fair value after this allocation is compared to the goodwill balance and any excess goodwill is charged to expense. We also determined that the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was less than its carrying amount. As a result, we recorded non-cash impairment charges for both items. As previously disclosed, the fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset have been reduced in recent years, including further reductions during the year and quarter ending June 30, 2019 . These reductions were due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar, a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits, primarily in the developed markets, and an increased competitive market environment in the U.S. and certain other markets, which collectively have resulted in reduced cash flow projections. A non-cash before and after-tax impairment charge of $ 6.8 billion was recognized to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill for the Shave Care reporting unit. Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of the Shave Care goodwill is $ 12.6 billion . Additionally, a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge of $ 1.6 billion ( $ 1.2 billion after-tax) was recognized to reduce the carrying amount of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value as of June 30, 2019 . Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is $ 14.1 billion . We believe the estimates and assumptions utilized in our impairment testing are reasonable and are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those used in our valuations. To the extent such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows initially used to estimate fair value for purposes of establishing or subsequently impairing the carrying amount of goodwill and related intangible assets, we may need to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future. During fiscal 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of the over the counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC), which is included in the Health Care reportable segment (see Note 14), along with other minor acquisitions in the Beauty, the Baby, Feminine  Family Care and the Fabric  Home Care reportable segments. Goodwill increases due to acquisitions were partially offset by the divestiture of the Teva portion of the PGT business in the Health Care reportable segment and currency translation. The change in goodwill during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to acquisitions of two brands within the Beauty reportable segment and currency translation across all reportable segments.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using the enacted statutory tax rates and are adjusted for any changes in such rates in the period of change. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"U.S. Tax Act\"). The U.S. Tax Act significantly revised the future ongoing U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rates and implementing a hybrid territorial tax system. As the Company has a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 28 % for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 , and 21 % for subsequent fiscal years. However, the U.S. Tax Act eliminated the domestic manufacturing deduction and moved to a hybrid territorial system, which also largely eliminated the ability to credit certain foreign taxes that existed prior to enactment of the U.S. Tax Act. There are also certain transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act. As part of the transition to the new hybrid territorial tax system, the U.S. Tax Act imposed a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate caused us to adjust our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal base rate of 21 % . These transitional impacts resulted in a provisional net charge of $ 602 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, comprised of an estimated repatriation tax charge of $ 3.8 billion (comprised of U.S. repatriation taxes and foreign withholding taxes) and an estimated net deferred tax benefit of $ 3.2 billion . The transitional impact was finalized during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, with no significant impact on income tax expense. Any legislative changes, as well as any other new or proposed Treasury regulations to address questions that arise because of the U.S. Tax Act, may result in additional income tax impacts which could be material in the period any such changes are enacted. The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\") provision of the U.S. Tax Act requires the Company to include in its U.S. Income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary's tangible assets. An accounting policy election is available to account for the tax effects of GILTI either as a current period expense when incurred, or to recognize deferred taxes for book and tax basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years. We have elected to account for the tax effects of GILTI as a current period expense when incurred. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   United States $ 1,659  $ 9,277  $ 9,031 International 4,410  4,049  4,226 TOTAL $ 6,069  $ 13,326  $ 13,257 ##TABLE_ENDIncome taxes on continuing operations consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   CURRENT TAX EXPENSE U.S. federal $ 1,064  $ 3,965  $ 1,531 International 1,259  1,131  1,243 U.S. state and local    2,514  5,309  3,015 DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE U.S. federal ( 296 )  ( 1,989 )  International and other ( 115 )    ( 411 )  ( 1,844 )  TOTAL TAX EXPENSE $ 2,103  $ 3,465  $ 3,063 ##TABLE_ENDAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 48 The Procter  Gamble Company A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to our actual income tax rate on continuing operations is provided below: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   U.S. federal statutory income tax rate 21.0 %  28.1 %  35.0 % Country mix impacts of foreign operations ( 0.5 )%  ( 4.7 )%  ( 6.8 )% Changes in uncertain tax positions ( 0.3 )%  ( 0.3 )%  ( 2.0 )% Excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options ( 3.8 )%  ( 0.4 )%  ( 1.3 )% Goodwill impairment 22.8 %   %   % Net transitional impact of U.S. Tax Act  %  4.5 %   % Other ( 4.5 )%  ( 1.2 )%  ( 1.8 )% EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE 34.7 %  26.0 %  23.1 % ##TABLE_ENDCountry mix impacts of foreign operations includes the effects of foreign subsidiaries' earnings taxed at rates other than the U.S. statutory rate, the U.S. tax impacts of non-U.S. earnings repatriation and any net impacts of intercompany transactions. Changes in uncertain tax positions represent changes in our net liability related to prior year tax positions. Excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options reflect the excess of actual tax benefits received on employee exercise of stock options and other share-based payments (which generally equals the income taxable to the employee) over the amount of tax benefits that were calculated at the grant dates of such instruments. Tax costs charged to shareholders' equity totaled $ 80 for the year ended June 30, 2019 . This primarily relates to the tax effects of Net Investment hedges and certain adjustments to pension obligations recorded in stockholders' equity. Tax benefits credited to shareholders' equity totaled $ 342 for the year ended June 30, 2018 . This primarily relates to the tax effects of Net Investment hedges, partially offset by the impact of certain adjustments to pension obligations recorded in stockholders' equity. Prior to the passage of the U.S. Tax Act, the Company asserted that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely invested and accordingly, no deferred taxes were provided. Pursuant to the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, these earnings were subjected to a one-time transition tax, for which a provisional charge has been recorded. This charge included taxes for all U.S. income taxes and for the related foreign withholding taxes for the portion of those earnings which are no longer considered indefinitely invested. We have not provided deferred taxes on approximately $ 27 billion of earnings that are considered permanently reinvested. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for uncertain tax positions is as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   BEGINNING OF YEAR $  $  $ Increases in tax positions for prior years   Decreases in tax positions for prior years ( 94 )  ( 38 )  ( 147 ) Increases in tax positions for current year   Settlements with taxing authorities ( 37 )  ( 45 )  ( 381 ) Lapse in statute of limitations ( 27 )  ( 20 )  ( 22 ) Currency translation ( 2 )  ( 5 )  ( 4 ) END OF YEAR $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDIncluded in the total liability for uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2019 is $ 159 that, depending on the ultimate resolution, could impact the effective tax rate in future periods. The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40 - 50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and the closing of statutes of limitation. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $ 140 , including interest and penalties. We recognize the additional accrual of any possible related interest and penalties relating to the underlying uncertain tax position in income tax expense. As of June 30, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , we had accrued interest of $ 133 , $ 99 and $ 100 and accrued penalties of $ 17 , $ 15 and $ 20 , respectively, which are not included in the above table. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , we recognized $ 40 , $ 22 and $( 62 ) in interest expense/(benefit) and $ 2 , $ 5 and $ 0 in penalties expense, respectively.

NOTE 6 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble less preferred dividends (net of related tax benefits) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. For fiscal years 2018 and 2017, Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The diluted shares are determined using the treasury stock method on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards (see Note 7) and the assumed conversion of preferred stock (see Note 8). For fiscal year 2019, Diluted net earnings per common share do not include the assumed conversion of preferred stock because to do so would have been antidilutive, due to the lower Net earnings driven by the Shave Care impairment charges (see Note 4). Therefore, Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble less preferred dividends (net of related tax benefit) by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The diluted shares are determined using the treasury stock method on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 50 The Procter  Gamble Company Net earnings per share were calculated as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Total  Total  Continuing Operations Discontinued Operations Total Net earnings $ 3,966  $ 9,861  $ 10,194 $ 5,217 $ 15,411 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests    Net earnings attributable to PG 3,897  9,750  10,109 5,217 15,326 Less: Preferred dividends, net of tax    Net earnings attributable to PG available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 3,634  $ 9,485  $ 9,862 $ 5,217 $ 15,079         Net earnings attributable to PG available to common shareholders (Diluted) $ 3,634  $ 9,750  $ 10,109 $ 5,217 $ 15,326         SHARES IN MILLIONS        Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,503.6  2,529.3  2,598.1 2,598.1 2,598.1 Add: Effect of dilutive securities        Impact of stock options and other unvested equity awards (1) 35.9  32.5  43.0 43.0 43.0 Conversion of preferred shares (2)   94.9  99.3 99.3 99.3 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,539.5  2,656.7  2,740.4 2,740.4 2,740.4         NET EARNINGS PER SHARE  (3)        Basic $ 1.45  $ 3.75  $ 3.79 $ 2.01 $ 5.80 Diluted $ 1.43  $ 3.67  $ 3.69 $ 1.90 $ 5.59 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Weighted average outstanding stock options of approximately 13 million in 2019 , 48 million in 2018 and 20 million in 2017 were not included in the Diluted net earnings per share calculation because the options were out of the money or to do so would have been antidilutive (i.e., the assumed proceeds upon exercise would have exceeded the market value of the underlying common shares). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Despite being included in Diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold. Shares may only be sold after being allocated to the ESOP participants pursuant to the repayment of the ESOP's obligations through 2035. In fiscal year 2019, weighted average outstanding preferred shares of 90 million were not included in the Diluted net earnings per share calculation because to do so would have been antidilutive, due to lower Net earnings driven by the Shave Care impairment charges (see Note 4). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3)  Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter  Gamble. ##TABLE_END NOTE 7 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION We have two primary stock-based compensation programs under which we annually grant stock option, restricted stock unit (RSU) and performance stock unit (PSU) awards to key managers and directors. In our main long-term incentive program, key managers can elect to receive options or RSUs. All options vest after three years and have a 10 -year life. Exercise prices on options are set equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of the grant. Effective in fiscal year 2017, RSUs vest and settle in shares of common stock three years from the grant date. RSUs granted prior to fiscal year 2017 vest and settle in shares of common stock five years from the grant date. Senior-level executives participate in an additional long-term incentive program that awards PSUs, which are paid in shares after the end of a three-year performance period subject to pre-established performance goals. Effective in fiscal year 2019, we added a Relative Total Shareholder Return (R-TSR) modifier to the PSU, under which the number of shares ultimately granted is also impacted by the Company's actual shareholder return relative to our consumer products competitive peer set. In addition to these long-term incentive programs, we award RSUs to the Company's non-employee directors and make other minor stock option and RSU grants to employees for which the terms are not substantially different from our long-term incentive awards. A total of 185 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the stock-based compensation plan approved by shareholders in 2014, of which 41 million shares remain available for grant. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards at the date of grant. The fair value is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are recognized as compensation expense from the grant date through the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide services to earn the award. Stock-based compensation expense is included as part of Cost of products sold and SGA in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 51 includes an estimate of forfeitures, which is based on historical data. Total expense and related tax benefit were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   2017 (1) Stock options $  $  $ RSUs and PSUs   Total stock-based expense $  $  $       Income tax benefit $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Includes amounts related to discontinued operations, which are not material. ##TABLE_END We utilize an industry standard lattice-based valuation model to calculate the fair value for stock options granted. Assumptions utilized in the model, which are evaluated and revised to reflect market conditions and experience, were as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   Interest rate 2.5 - 2.7 %  1.9 - 2.9 %  0.8 - 2.6 % Weighted average interest rate 2.6 %  2.8 %  2.6 % Dividend yield 3.0 %  3.1 %  3.2 % Expected volatility %  %  % Expected life in years 9.2   9.2   9.6  ##TABLE_ENDLattice-based option valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs and those ranges are disclosed in the preceding table. Expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatilities of call options on our stock. We use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination patterns within the valuation model. The expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. A summary of options outstanding under the plans as of June 30, 2019 and activity during the year then ended is presented below: ##TABLE_START Options Options (in thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Contract-ual Life in Years Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding, beginning of year 205,654 $ 74.21   Granted 13,451 95.78   Exercised ( 53,670 ) 62.99   Forfeited/expired ( 694 ) 81.58   OUTSTANDING, END OF YEAR 164,741 $ 79.59 5.6 $ 4,951 EXERCISABLE 110,504 $ 75.07 4.2 $ 3,822 ##TABLE_ENDThe following table provides additional information on stock options: ##TABLE_START Years ended June 30   Weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted $ 13.60  $ 11.89  $ 10.45 Intrinsic value of options exercised 1,770   1,334 Grant-date fair value of options that vested   Cash received from options exercised 3,381  1,245  2,630 Actual tax benefit from options exercised   ##TABLE_ENDAt June 30, 2019 , there was $ 174 of compensation cost that has not yet been recognized related to stock option grants.

The total grant date fair value of shares vested was $ 205 , $ 175 and $ 163 in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The Company settles equity issuances with treasury shares. We have no specific policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options, RSUs and PSUs. However, we have historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash availability, market trends and other factors, to offset the impacts of such activity. NOTE 8 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN We offer various postretirement benefits to our employees. Defined Contribution Retirement Plans We have defined contribution plans, which cover the majority of our U.S. employees, as well as employees in certain other countries. These plans are fully funded. We generally make contributions to participants' accounts based on individual base salaries and years of service. Total global defined contribution Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 52 The Procter  Gamble Company expense was $ 272 , $ 292 and $ 270 in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The primary U.S. defined contribution plan (the U.S. DC plan) comprises the majority of the expense for the Company's defined contribution plans. For the U.S. DC plan, the contribution rate is set annually. Total contributions for this plan approximated 14 % of total participants' annual wages and salaries in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . We maintain The Procter  Gamble Profit Sharing Trust (Trust) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) to provide a portion of the funding for the U.S. DC plan and other retiree benefits (described below). Operating details of the ESOP are provided at the end of this Note. The fair value of the ESOP Series A shares allocated to participants reduces our cash contribution required to fund the U.S. DC plan. Defined Benefit Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits We offer defined benefit retirement pension plans to certain employees. These benefits relate primarily to local plans outside the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, plans assumed in previous acquisitions covering U.S. employees. We also provide certain other retiree benefits, primarily health care and life insurance, for the majority of our U.S. employees who become eligible for these benefits when they meet minimum age and service requirements. Generally, the health care plans require cost sharing with retirees and pay a stated percentage of expenses, reduced by deductibles and other coverages. These benefits are primarily funded by ESOP Series B shares and certain other assets contributed by the Company. Obligation and Funded Status . The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of these defined benefit plans: ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits (1)  Other Retiree Benefits (2) Years ended June 30    CHANGE IN BENEFIT OBLIGATION        Benefit obligation at beginning of year (3) $ 15,658 $ 16,160 $ 4,778 $ 5,187 Service cost    Interest cost    Participants' contributions    Amendments     ( 231 ) Net actuarial loss/(gain) 1,587  ( 722 )   ( 308 ) Acquisitions/(divestitures)       Special termination benefits    Currency translation and other ( 283 )    Benefit payments ( 606 )  ( 589 )  ( 243 )  ( 244 ) BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT END OF YEAR (3) $ 17,037  $ 15,658  $ 4,964  $ 4,778 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START CHANGE IN PLAN ASSETS        Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 11,267  $ 10,829  $ 3,259  $ 3,831 Actual return on plan assets   1,918  ( 481 ) Acquisitions/(divestitures)       Employer contributions    Participants' contributions    Currency translation and other ( 212 )   ( 1 )  ( 3 ) ESOP debt impacts (4)      Benefit payments ( 606 )  ( 589 )  ( 243 )  ( 244 ) FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AT END OF YEAR $ 11,382  $ 11,267  $ 5,096  $ 3,259 FUNDED STATUS $ ( 5,655 )  $ ( 4,391 )  $  $ ( 1,519 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Primarily non-U.S.-based defined benefit retirement plans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Primarily U.S.-based other postretirement benefit plans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  For the pension benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation.

In these instances, benefit payments are typically paid directly from the Company's cash as they become due. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.

For the remaining plans, the Company determines these amounts utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the corporate bond yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. Several factors are considered in developing the estimate for the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets. For the defined benefit retirement plans, these factors include historical rates of return of broad equity and bond indices and projected long-term rates of return obtained from pension investment consultants. The expected long-term rates of return for plan assets are 8 - 9 % for equities and 5 - 6 % for bonds. For other retiree benefit plans, the expected long-term rate of return reflects that the assets are comprised primarily of Company stock. The expected rate of return on Company stock is based on the long-term projected return of 8.5 % and reflects the historical pattern of returns. Assumed health care cost trend rates could have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other retiree benefit plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: ##TABLE_START  One-Percentage Point Increase  One-Percentage Point Decrease Effect on the total service and interest cost components $  $ ( 45 ) Effect on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation  ( 619 ) ##TABLE_ENDPlan Assets . Our investment objective for defined benefit retirement plan assets is to meet the plans' benefit obligations and to improve plan self-sufficiency for future benefit obligations. The investment strategies focus on asset class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit payments and an appropriate balance of long-term investment return and risk. Target ranges for asset allocations are determined by assessing different investment risks and matching the actuarial projections of the plans' future liabilities and benefit payments with current as well as expected long-term rates of return on the assets, taking into account investment return volatility and correlations across asset classes. Plan assets are diversified across several investment managers and are generally Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 55 invested in liquid funds that are selected to track broad market equity and bond indices. Investment risk is carefully controlled with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and with continual monitoring of investment managers' performance relative to the investment guidelines established with each investment manager. Our target asset allocation for the year ended June 30, 2019 , and actual asset allocation by asset category as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 , were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Target Asset Allocation  Actual Asset Allocation at June 30  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits Asset Category      Cash  %  %  %  %  %  % Debt securities %  %  %  %  %  % Equity securities %  %  %  %  %  % TOTAL %  %  %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDThe following tables set forth the fair value of the Company's plan assets as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy (refer to Note 9 for further discussion on the fair value hierarchy and fair value principles). Company stock listed as Level 1 in the hierarchy represents Company common stock; Level 2 represents preferred shares which are valued based on the value of Company common stock. The majority of our Level 3 pension assets are insurance contracts. Their fair values are based on their cash equivalent or models that project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs, including credit risk and interest rate curves. There was no significant activity within the Level 3 pension and other retiree benefits plan assets during the years presented. Investments valued using net asset value as a practical expedient are primarily equity and fixed income collective funds. These assets are not valued using the fair value hierarchy, but rather valued using the net asset value reported by the managers of the funds and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits As of June 30 Fair Value Hierarchy Level    Fair Value Hierarchy Level   ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE            Cash and cash equivalents  $  $   $  $ Company stock (1)       1  2  4,836  3,092 Other (2) 1, 2  3      TOTAL ASSETS IN THE FAIR VALUE HEIRARCHY       4,948  3,101 Investments valued at net asset value   10,957  10,731     TOTAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE   $ 11,382  11,267    $ 5,096  3,259 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Company stock is net of ESOP debt discussed below . ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  The Company's other pension plan assets measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.

Management's best estimate of cash requirements and discretionary contributions for the defined benefit retirement plans and other retiree benefit plans for the year ending June 30, 2020 , is $ 156 and $ 39 , respectively. For the defined benefit retirement plans, this is comprised of $ 94 in expected benefit payments from the Company directly to participants of unfunded plans and $ 62 of expected contributions to funded plans. For other retiree benefit plans, this is comprised of $ 27 in expected benefit payments from the Company directly to participants of unfunded plans and $ 12 of expected contributions to funded plans. Expected contributions are dependent on many variables, including the variability of the market value of the plan assets as compared to the benefit obligation and other market or regulatory conditions. In addition, we take into consideration our business investment opportunities and resulting cash requirements. Accordingly, actual funding may differ significantly from current estimates. Total benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which include payments funded from the Company's assets and payments from the plans are as follows: ##TABLE_START Years ending June 30 Pension Benefits  Other Retiree Benefits EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS   $  $ 2021  2022  2023  2024  2025 - 2029 3,220  1,283 ##TABLE_ENDAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 56 The Procter  Gamble Company Employee Stock Ownership Plan We maintain the ESOP to provide funding for certain employee benefits discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The ESOP borrowed $ 1.0 billion in 1989 and the proceeds were used to purchase Series A ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the U.S. DC plan. Principal and interest requirements of the borrowing were paid by the Trust from dividends on the preferred shares and from advances provided by the Company. The original borrowing of $ 1.0 billion has been repaid in full, and advances from the Company of $ 42 remain outstanding at June 30, 2019 . Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock. The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $ 2.90 per share. The liquidation value is $ 6.82 per share. In 1991, the ESOP borrowed an additional $ 1.0 billion . The proceeds were used to purchase Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of retiree health care benefits. These shares, net of the ESOP's debt, are considered plan assets of the other retiree benefits plan discussed above. Debt service requirements are funded by preferred stock dividends, cash contributions and advances provided by the Company, of which $ 876 are outstanding at June 30, 2019 . Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock. The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $ 2.90 per share. The liquidation value is $ 12.96 per share. Our ESOP accounting practices are consistent with current ESOP accounting guidance, including the permissible continuation of certain provisions from prior accounting guidance. ESOP debt, which is guaranteed by the Company, is recorded as debt (see Note 10) with an offset to the Reserve for ESOP debt retirement, which is presented within Shareholders' equity. Advances to the ESOP by the Company are recorded as an increase in the Reserve for ESOP debt retirement. Interest incurred on the ESOP debt is recorded as Interest expense. Dividends on all preferred shares, net of related tax benefits, are charged to Retained earnings. The series A and B preferred shares of the ESOP are allocated to employees based on debt service requirements. The number of preferred shares outstanding at June 30 was as follows: ##TABLE_START Shares in thousands   Allocated 31,600  34,233  36,488 Unallocated 3,259  4,117  5,060 TOTAL SERIES A 34,859  38,350  41,548     Allocated 26,790  25,895  25,378 Unallocated 26,471  28,512  30,412 TOTAL SERIES B 53,261  54,407  55,790 ##TABLE_ENDFor purposes of calculating diluted net earnings per common share, the preferred shares held by the ESOP are considered converted from inception. NOTE 9 RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. To the extent we choose to manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions that we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. If the Company elects to do so and if the instrument meets certain specified accounting criteria, management designates derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges. We record derivative instruments at fair value and the accounting for changes in the fair value depends on the intended use of the derivative, the resulting designation and the effectiveness of the instrument in offsetting the risk exposure it is designed to hedge. We generally have a high degree of effectiveness between the exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument. Credit Risk Management We have counterparty credit guidelines and normally enter into transactions with investment grade financial institutions, to the extent commercially viable. Counterparty exposures are monitored daily and downgrades in counterparty credit ratings are reviewed on a timely basis. We have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, material credit losses on our risk management or other financial instruments. Substantially all of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position as of June 30, 2019 , was not material. The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features. Interest Rate Risk Management Our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. To manage this risk in a cost-efficient manner, we enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to exchange with the counterparty, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional amount. We designate certain interest rate swaps that meet specific accounting criteria as fair value hedges. For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in earnings. Historically, we had certain interest Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 57 rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. For the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , we did not have any such contracts outstanding. Foreign Currency Risk Management We manufacture and sell our products and finance our operations in a number of countries throughout the world. As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We leverage the Companys diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge. In certain cases, we enter into non-qualifying foreign currency contracts to hedge certain balance sheet items subject to revaluation. The change in fair value of these instruments and the underlying exposure are both immediately recognized in earnings. To manage exchange rate risk related to our intercompany financing, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps. The change in fair value of these non-qualifying instruments is immediately recognized in earnings, substantially offsetting the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. Historically, we had utilized foreign currency swaps to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies; these swaps were accounted for as cash flow hedges. For the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , we did not have any such contracts outstanding. Net Investment Hedging We hedge certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries. To accomplish this, we either borrow directly in foreign currencies and designate all or a portion of the foreign currency debt as a hedge of the applicable net investment position or we enter into foreign currency swaps that are designated as hedges of net investments. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in the Foreign Currency Translation component of OCI and offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. The time value component of the net investment hedge currency swaps is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Changes in the fair value of the swap, including changes in the fair value of the excluded time value component, are recognized in OCI and offset the value of the underlying net assets. The time value component is subsequently reported in income on a systematic basis. Commodity Risk Management Certain raw materials used in our products or production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. To manage the volatility related to anticipated purchases of certain of these materials, we have historically, on a limited basis, used futures and options with maturities generally less than one year and swap contracts with maturities up to five years . As of and during the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , we did not have any commodity hedging activity. Insurance We self-insure for most insurable risks. However, we purchase insurance for Directors and Officers Liability and certain other coverage where it is required by law or by contract. Fair Value Hierarchy Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: ##TABLE_START  Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets. ##TABLE_END When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets or liabilities during the year. When active market quotes are not available for financial assets and liabilities, we use industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including credit risk, interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies. In circumstances where market-based observable inputs are not available, management judgment is used to develop assumptions to estimate fair value. Generally, the fair value of our Level 3 instruments is estimated as the net present value of expected future cash flows based on external inputs. T he following table sets forth the Company's financial assets as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period: ##TABLE_START  Fair Value Asset As of June 30  Investments:    U.S. government securities $ 3,648  $ 5,544 Corporate bond securities 2,400  3,737 Other investments  TOTAL $ 6,217  $ 9,422 ##TABLE_ENDInvestment securities are presented in Available-for-sale investment securities and Other noncurrent assets. The amortized cost of the U.S. government securities with maturities less than one year was $ 100 and $ 2,003 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The amortized cost of the U.S. government securities with maturities between one and five years was $ 3,556 and $ 3,659 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The amortized cost of corporate bond securities with maturities of less than a year was $ 1,347 and $ 1,291 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The amortized cost of corporate bond securities with maturities between one and five years was $ 1,057 and $ 2,503 as of Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 58 The Procter  Gamble Company June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The Company's investments measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Within cash and cash equivalents, we have money market funds of $ 2,956 and $ 1,516 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. These funds are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. There are no other material investment balances classified as Level 1 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, or using net asset value as a practical expedient. Fair values are generally estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of long-term debt was $ 25,378 and $ 23,402 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. This includes the current portion of debt instruments ( $ 3,390 and $ 1,769 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost, but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Notional Amount  Fair Value Asset  Fair Value (Liability) As of June 30      DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS       Interest rate contracts $ 7,721  $ 4,587  $  $  $ ( 1 )  $ ( 53 ) DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS       Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 3,157  $ 1,848  $  $  $ ( 24 )  $ ( 75 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 10,878  $ 6,435  $  $  $ ( 25 )  $ ( 128 )             DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS       Foreign currency contracts $ 6,431  $ 7,358  $  $  $ ( 20 )  $ ( 56 )             TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 17,309  $ 13,793  $  $  $ ( 45 )  $ ( 184 ) ##TABLE_ENDAll derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/liability directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $ 7,860 and $ 4,639 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 17,154 and $ 15,012 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The increase in the notional balance of interest rate fair value hedges is due to additional swaps in the current period driven by the favorable Euro swap curve. The increase in the notional balance of the net investment hedges, including the debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, is primarily driven by the increase in foreign currency net assets as a result of the Merck acquisition. All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. In addition, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. Except for the impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset discussed in Note 4, there were no significant assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 . Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 59 Before tax gains/(losses) on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: ##TABLE_START  Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Years ended June 30  DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2) Foreign currency interest rate contracts $  $ ( 187 ) ##TABLE_END(1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain/(loss) excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $ 70 and $ 138 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. ##TABLE_START (2)  In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges.

These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in Interest Expense. The gain/(loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in SGA. To the extent we have any derivatives used for cash flow hedging relationships, the gain/(loss) reclassified from AOCI into earnings on such derivatives would be recognized in the same period during which the related item affects earnings, typically in SGA.

See Note 9 for classification of gains and losses from hedges in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. ##TABLE_END NOTE 12 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Guarantees In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may provide routine indemnifications (e.g., indemnification for representations and warranties and retention of previously existing environmental, tax and employee liabilities) for which terms range in duration and, in some circumstances, are not explicitly defined. The maximum obligation under some indemnifications is also not explicitly stated and, as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss on any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In certain situations, we guarantee loans for suppliers and customers. The total amount of guarantees issued under such arrangements is not material. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that have a material impact on our financial statements. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter  Gamble Company 61 Purchase Commitments and Operating Leases We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations are as follows:  ##TABLE_START Years ending June 30 2021 2023 There-after Purchase obligations $ $ $ $ $ $ ##TABLE_ENDSuch amounts represent minimum commitments under take-or-pay agreements with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. These amounts include purchase commitments related to service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced to third-party suppliers. Due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination. We do not expect to incur penalty payments under these provisions that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We also lease certain property and equipment for varying periods. Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:  ##TABLE_START Years ending June 30 2021 2023 There-after Operating leases $ $ $ $ $ $ ##TABLE_ENDLitigation We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. NOTE 13 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS During the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories to Coty, Inc. (Coty). The divestiture included 41 of the Company's beauty brands (Beauty Brands), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and a majority of the fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. The form of the divestiture transaction was a Reverse Morris Trust split-off, in which PG shareholders were given the election to exchange their PG shares for shares of a new corporation that held the Beauty Brands (Galleria Co.), and then immediately exchange those shares for Coty shares. The value PG received in the transaction was $ 11.4 billion . The value was comprised of 105 million shares of common stock of the Company, which were tendered by shareholders of the Company and exchanged for the Galleria Co. shares, valued at approximately $ 9.4 billion , and the assumption of $ 1.9 billion of debt by Galleria Co. The shares tendered in the transaction were reflected as an addition to treasury stock and the cash received related to the debt assumed by Coty was reflected as an investing activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the final transaction of $ 5.3 billion , net of transaction and related costs. Two of the fine fragrance brands, Dolce  Gabbana and Christina Aguilera, were excluded from the divestiture. These brands were subsequently divested at amounts that approximated their adjusted carrying values. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Beauty Brands are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for the year ended June 30, 2017. The Beauty Brands were historically part of the Company's Beauty reportable segment. T he following is selected financial information included in Net earnings from discontinued operations for the Beauty Brands: ##TABLE_START  Beauty Brands Years ended June 30 Net sales $ 1,159 Cost of products sold Selling, general and administrative expense Interest expense Other non-operating income/(expense), net Loss from discontinued operations before income taxes ( 72 ) Income taxes on discontinued operations Gain on sale of business before income taxes 5,197 Income tax expense/(benefit) on sale of business (1) ( 138 ) Net earnings from discontinued operations $ 5,217 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  The income tax benefit of the Beauty Brands divestiture represents the reversal of underlying deferred tax balances partially offset by current tax expense related to the transaction. ##TABLE_END Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 62 The Procter  Gamble Company The following is selected financial information included in cash flows from discontinued operations for the Beauty Brands: ##TABLE_START  Beauty Brands Years ended June 30 NON-CASH OPERATING ITEMS  Depreciation and amortization $ Deferred income tax benefit ( 649 ) Gain on sale of businesses 5,210 Net increase in accrued taxes CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES Cash taxes paid $ CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES Capital expenditures $ ##TABLE_ENDNOTE 14 MERCK ACQUISITION On November 30, 2018, we completed our acquisition of the over the counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) for $ 3.7 billion (based on exchange rates at the time of closing) in an all-cash transaction. This business primarily sells OTC consumer healthcare products, mainly in Europe, Latin America and Asia markets. The results of Merck OTC, which are not material to the Company, are reported in our consolidated financial statements beginning December 1, 2018. The following table presents the preliminary allocation of purchase price related to the Merck OTC business as of the date of acquisition. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is based on the best estimates of management and is subject to revision based on final determination of fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired, which will be completed as we complete our analysis of the underlying assets and acquired liabilities, such as pensions, litigation cases, environmental issues, and tax positions. ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions November 30, 2018 Current assets $ Property, plant and equipment Intangible assets 2,143 Goodwill 2,138 Other non-current assets Total Assets Acquired $ 4,964   Current liabilities $ Deferred income taxes Non-current liabilities Total Liabilities Acquired $ 1,087   Noncontrolling Interest (1) $   Net Assets Acquired $ 3,708 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Represents a 48% minority ownership interest in the Merck India company. ##TABLE_END We have preliminarily estimated the fair value of Merck OTCs identifiable intangible assets as $ 2.1 billion . The preliminary allocation of identifiable intangible assets and their average useful lives is as follows: ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions Estimated Fair Value  Avg Remaining Useful Life Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives Brands $  Patents and technology  Customer relationships  Total $ 1,197      Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives Brands   Total Intangible Assets $ 2,143   ##TABLE_ENDThe majority of the intangible valuation relates to brand intangibles. Our preliminary assessment as to brand intangibles that have an indefinite life and those that have a definite life was based on a number of factors, including competitive environment, market share, brand history, product life cycles, operating plan and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. The indefinite-lived brand intangibles include Neurobion and Dolo Neurobion. The definite-lived brand intangibles primarily include regional or local brands. The definite-lived brand intangibles have estimated lives ranging from 10 to 20 years. The technology intangibles are related to RD and manufacturing know-how; these intangibles have a 10 -year estimated life. The customer relationships intangibles have a 20 -year estimated life and reflect the historical and projected attrition rates for Merck OTCs relationships with health care professionals, retailers and distributors.

In the quarter ended June 30, 2019, the Company reported a Net loss attributable to PG, driven by the Shave Care impairment charges discussed in Note 4. This caused certain of our equity instruments to be antidilutive for the full year (preferred shares) and for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 (preferred shares and equity awards). Because these securities were dilutive during the first three quarters of this fiscal year, the sum of the four quarters' Diluted net earnings/(loss) per share will not equal the full-year Diluted net earnings per common share. ##TABLE_END ", "9A": " Item 9A.
