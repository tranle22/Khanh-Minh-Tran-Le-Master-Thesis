Business ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (a) General Development of Business ##TABLE_END Summary Description of Chevron Chevron Corporation,* a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations, mining operations, power generation and energy services. Exploration and production (upstream) operations consist of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas and also marketing natural gas. Refining, marketing and transportation (downstream) operations relate to refining crude oil and converting natural gas into finished petroleum products; marketing crude oil and the many products derived from petroleum; and transporting crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car. Chemicals operations include the manufacture and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant oil additives. A list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on pages E-23 and E-24. As of December 31, 2009, Chevron had approximately 64,000 employees (including about 4,000 service station employees). Approximately 31,500 employees (including about 3,500 service station employees), or 49 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. Overview of Petroleum Industry Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors, and individual petroleum companies have little control over some of them. Governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, have a significant impact on petroleum activities, regulating how companies are structured and where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limiting their profits directly. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand for these commodities. However, some governments impose price controls on refined products such as gasoline or diesel fuel. The members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are typically the worlds swing producers of crude oil, and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in the companys quarterly earnings during the year. Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude-oil and natural-gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron also competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining, marketing and transportation entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets. Operating Environment Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-9 of this Form 10-K in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the companys current business environment and outlook. * Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term Chevron and such terms as the company, the corporation, our, we and us may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise, it does not include affiliates of Chevron  i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. Chevron Strategic Direction Chevrons primary objective is to create stockholder value and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream, the companys strategies are to grow profitably in core areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the companys equity natural-gas resource base while growing a high-impact global gas business. In the downstream, the strategies are to improve returns and selectively grow, with a focus on integrated value creation. The company also continues to invest in renewable-energy technologies, with an objective of capturing profitable positions. ##TABLE_START (b) Description of Business and Properties ##TABLE_END The upstream, downstream and chemicals activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2009, and assets as of the end of 2009 and 2008  for the United States and the companys international geographic areas  are in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page FS-40. Similar comparative data for the companys investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Notes 12 and 13 on pages FS-43 through FS-45. Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Total expenditures for 2009 were $22.2 billion, including $1.6 billion for the companys share of equity-affiliate expenditures. In 2008 and 2007, expenditures were $22.8 billion and $20 billion, respectively, including the companys share of affiliates expenditures of $2.3 billion in both periods. Of the $22.2 billion in expenditures for 2009, about three-fourths, or $17.1 billion, was related to upstream activities. Approximately the same percentage was also expended for upstream operations in 2008 and 2007. International upstream accounted for about 80 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2009 and about 70 percent in 2008 and 2007, reflecting the companys continuing focus on opportunities available outside the United States. In 2010, the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be $21.6 billion, including $1.6 billion of spending by affiliates. About 80 percent of the total, or $17.3 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities, with $13.2 billion of that amount for projects outside the United States. Refer also to a discussion of the companys capital and exploratory expenditures on page FS-12. Upstream  Exploration and Production The table on the following page summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2009 and 2008 by the company and its affiliates.

The increase was mostly associated with the start-up of the Blind Faith and Tahiti fields in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in late 2008 and the second quarter 2009, respectively, the commencement of operations in the third quarter 2008 at the Agbami Field in Nigeria, and the expansion at Tengiz in Kazakhstan. Refer to the Results of Operations section beginning on page FS-6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2007-2009 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and natural gas. The company estimates that its average worldwide oil-equivalent production in 2010 will be approximately 2.73 million barrels per day. This estimate is subject to many uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, the price effect on production volumes calculated under cost-recovery and variable-royalty provisions of certain contracts, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project start-ups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, and production that may have to be shut in due to weather conditions, civil unrest, changing geopolitics or other disruptions to operations. Future production levels also are affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. Refer to the Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas, beginning on page 9, for a discussion of the companys major crude-oil and natural-gas development projects. Average Sales Prices and Production Costs per Unit of Production Refer to Table IV on page FS-69 for the companys average sales price per barrel of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids and per thousand cubic feet of natural gas produced and the average production cost per oil-equivalent barrel for 2009, 2008 and 2007. Gross and Net Productive Wells The following table summarizes gross and net productive wells at year-end 2009 for the company and its affiliates: Productive Oil and Gas Wells 1 at December 31, 2009 ##TABLE_START                  Productive 2,3 Productive 2 Oil Wells Gas Wells Gross Net Gross Net  United States 49,761 32,720 11,567 5,671 Africa 2,292 766 17 7 Asia 10,580 9,106 2,336 1,510 Other 1,605 963 275 74 Total Consolidated Companies 64,238 43,555 14,195 7,262 Equity in Affiliates 1,133 403 7 2 Total Including Affiliates 65,371 43,958 14,202 7,264 Multiple completion wells included above: 929 596 390 313 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 Includes wells producing or capable of producing and injection wells temporarily functioning as producing wells. Wells that produce both oil and gas are classified as oil wells. 2 Gross wells include the total number of wells in which the company has an interest. Net wells include wholly owned wells and the sum of the companys fractional interests in gross wells. 3 Canadian synthetic oil is not produced through wells and therefore is not presented in the table above. ##TABLE_END Reserves Refer to Table V beginning on page FS-69 for a tabulation of the companys proved net crude-oil and natural-gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2007 and each year-end from 2007 through 2009, and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending December 31, 2009. During 2009, the company provided crude-oil and natural-gas reserves estimates for 2008 to the Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (EIA) that agree with the 2008 reserve volumes in Table V. This reporting fulfilled the requirement that such estimates be consistent with, and not differ more than 5 percent from, the information furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the companys 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During 2010, the company will file estimates of crude-oil and natural-gas reserves with the Department of Energy, EIA, consistent with the 2009 reserve data reported in Table V. The net proved-reserve balances at the end of each of the three years 2007 through 2009 are shown in the table below: Net Proved Reserves at December 31 ##TABLE_START              2009 2008 2007  Liquids*  Millions of barrels Consolidated Companies 4,610 4,735 4,665 Affiliated Companies 2,363 2,615 2,422 Natural Gas  Billions of cubic feet Consolidated Companies 22,153 19,022 19,137 Affiliated Companies 3,896 4,053 3,003 Total Oil-Equivalent  Millions of barrels Consolidated Companies 8,303 7,905 7,855 Affiliated Companies 3,012 3,291 2,922 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START * Crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. 2009 liquids amount for consolidated companies includes 460 million barrels of synthetic oil produced from oil sands mining operations in Canada in accordance with the adoption of the new SEC definition of oil and gas producing activity. ##TABLE_END Acreage At December 31, 2009, the company owned or had under lease or similar agreements undeveloped and developed crude-oil and natural-gas properties located throughout the world. The geographical distribution of the companys acreage is shown in the following table.

Net acreage includes wholly owned interests and the sum of the companys fractional interests in gross acreage. 2 Table does not include mining acreage associated with the synthetic oil production in Canada. At year-end 2009, undeveloped gross and net acreage totaled 235 and 31, respectively. Developed gross and net acreage totaled 35 and 7, respectively. Developed acreage is acreage associated with productive mines. Undeveloped acreage is acreage on which mines have not been established and that may contain undeveloped proved reserves. 3 Developed acreage is spaced or assignable to productive wells. Undeveloped acreage is acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to permit commercial production and that may contain undeveloped proved reserves. The gross undeveloped acres that will expire in 2010, 2011 and 2012 if production is not established by certain required dates are 13,526, 9,784 and 3,662, respectively. ##TABLE_END 7 Delivery Commitments The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural-gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. In the United States, the company has no fixed and determinable delivery commitments to third-parties or affiliates. Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver to third parties a total of 821 billion cubic feet of natural gas from 2010 through 2012 from Australia, Colombia, Denmark and the Philippines. The sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the companys proved developed reserves in Australia, Colombia, Denmark and the Philippines. Development Activities Refer to Table I on page FS-64 for details associated with the companys development expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for 2009, 2008 and 2007. The table below summarizes the companys net interest in productive and dry development wells completed in each of the past three years and the status of the companys development wells drilling at December 31, 2009. A development well is a well drilled within the proved area of a crude-oil or natural-gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.

Completion refers to the installation of permanent equipment for the production of crude oil or natural gas or, in the case of a dry well, the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency. Some exploratory wells are not drilled with the intention of producing from the well bore. In such cases, completion refers to the completion of drilling. Further categorization of productive or dry is based on the determination as to whether hydrocarbons in a sufficient quantity were found to justify completion as a producing well, whether or not the well is actually going to be completed as a producer. 3 Represents wells that are in the process of drilling but have been neither abandoned nor completed as of the last day of the year, including wells for which drilling was not completed and which were temporarily suspended at the end of 2009. Gross wells include the total number of wells in which the company has an interest. Net wells include wholly owned wells and the sum of the companys fractional interests in gross wells. ##TABLE_END Refer to Table I on page FS-64 for detail of the companys exploration expenditures and costs of unproved property acquisitions for 2009, 2008 and 2007. Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas Chevrons 2009 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page FS-2, are presented below. The comments include references to total production and net production, which are defined under Production in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-42. The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not yet on production and for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for recent discoveries that have yet to advance to a project stage or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not the companys share of costs for projects that are less than wholly owned. ##TABLE_START      Chevron has production and exploration activities in most of the worlds major hydrocarbon basins. The companys upstream strategy is to grow profitably in core areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the companys equity natural-gas resource base while growing a high-impact global gas business. The map at left indicates Chevrons primary areas of production and exploration. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START a) United States ##TABLE_END Upstream activities in the United States are concentrated in California, the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, the Rocky Mountains and Alaska. Average net oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2009 was 717,000 barrels per day. In California, the company has significant production in the San Joaquin Valley. In 2009, average net oil-equivalent production was 211,000 barrels per day, composed of 191,000 barrels of crude oil, 91 million cubic feet of natural gas and 5,000 barrels of natural gas liquids. Approximately 84 percent of the crude-oil production is considered heavy oil (typically with API gravity lower than 22 degrees). Average net oil-equivalent production during 2009 for the companys combined interests in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and deepwater areas, and the onshore fields in the region was 243,000 barrels per day. The daily oil-equivalent production comprised 149,000 barrels of crude oil, 484 million cubic feet of natural gas and 14,000 barrels of natural gas liquids. ##TABLE_START      During 2009, Chevron was engaged in various development and exploration activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The 75 percent-owned and operated Blind Faith development, which achieved first oil in the fourth quarter 2008, reached maximum total production of 70,000 barrels per day of oil-equivalent in 2009. Blind Faith has an estimated production life of 20 years. At the 58 percent-owned and operated Tahiti Field, first oil was achieved in the second quarter 2009. Maximum total production of 135,000 barrels per day of oil-equivalent was achieved in the third quarter 2009. A second development phase is under evaluation, including additional development drilling and a probable waterflood, with a final investment decision planned formid-2010. The waterflood includes water injection topsides ##TABLE_END equipment, subsea equipment and water injection wells. Tahiti has an estimated production life of 30 years. As of the end of 2009, proved reserves had been recognized for the first development phase of the Tahiti Field. The company is participating in the ultra-deepwater Perdido Regional Development. The project encompasses the installation of a producing host facility to service multiple fields, including Chevrons 33.3 percent-owned Great White, 60 percent-owned Silvertip and 57.5 percent-owned Tobago. Chevron has a 37.5 percent interest in the Perdido Regional Host. All of these fields and the production facility are partner-operated. Activities during 2009 included installation of the topsides on the spar, installation of umbilicals, hook-up and commissioning of the facility systems, and ongoing development drilling. First oil is expected in the first half of 2010, with the facility designed to handle 130,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day. The project has an expected life of approximately 25 years. Proved reserves have been recognized for the project. The company has a 60 percent-owned and operated interest in Big Foot. Two successful appraisal wells have been drilled, the most recent in the first quarter 2009. The company also acquired the rights to an adjacent block during 2009. The project entered front-end engineering and design (FEED) in October 2009 and a final investment decision is expected in late 2010. Total maximum production from the project is expected to be 63,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been recognized. The Caesar and Tonga partnerships for properties located in a number of blocks in the Green Canyon area have formed a unit agreement for the area, with Chevron having a 20.3 percent nonoperated working interest. A final investment decision on the joint Caesar-Tonga project was made in the first quarter 2009. Development plans include four wells and a subsea tie-back to a nearby third-party production facility. Two development sidetracks were completed during the year. Proved reserves have been recognized for the project and first oil is expected in 2011. The Jack and St. Malo fields are located within 25 miles of each other and are being considered for joint development. Chevron has a 50 percent-owned interest in Jack and a 51 percent-owned interest in St. Malo, following the anticipated acquisition of an additional 9.8 percent equity interest in St. Malo in March 2010. Both fields are company operated. The project entered FEED in May 2009 and a final investment decision is expected in late 2010. The facility is planned to have an initial design capacity of 150,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day and start-up is expected in 2014. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been recognized. Deepwater exploration activities in 2009 and early 2010 included participation in 10 exploratory wells  five wildcat, three appraisal and two delineation. Exploratory work included the following: ##TABLE_START   Buckskin  55 percent-owned and operated. A successful wildcat discovery was announced in February 2009. The first appraisal well is scheduled to begin drilling in the second quarter 2010.    Knotty Head  25 percent nonoperated working interest. The first appraisal well began drilling in October 2009 at this 2005 discovery.    Puma  21.8 percent nonoperated working interest. An appraisal well completed drilling in early 2009. Leases were relinquished in mid-2009.    Tubular Bells  30 percent nonoperated working interest. Studies to screen and evaluate future development alternatives were continuing at the end of 2009. ##TABLE_END At the end of 2009, the company had not recognized proved reserves for any of the exploration projects discussed above. Besides the activities connected with the development and exploration projects in the Gulf of Mexico, the company also has contracted capacity of 1 billion cubic feet per day at the third-party Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification terminal in Louisiana. The 20-year capacity reservation agreement became effective in July 2009 and enables import of natural gas for the North America market. In September 2009, Chevron began to utilize a portion of the reserved capacity under this agreement. Chevron has also contracted 1.6 billion cubic feet per day of capacity in a third-party pipeline system connecting the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to the natural-gas pipeline grid. The new pipeline, which was placed in service in July 2009, provides access to two major salt dome storage fields and 10 major interstate pipeline systems, including an interconnect with Chevrons Sabine Pipeline, which connects to the Henry Hub. An interconnect to Chevrons Bridgeline Pipeline is scheduled to be completed in the third quarter 2010. The Henry Hub interconnects to nine interstate and four intrastate pipelines and is the pricing point for natural gas futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Outside California and the Gulf of Mexico, the company manages operations across the mid-continental United States and Alaska. During 2009, the companys U.S. production outside California and the Gulf of Mexico averaged 263,000 net oil-equivalent barrels per day, composed of 94,000 barrels of crude oil, 824 million cubic feet of natural gas and 31,000 barrels of natural gas liquids. In the Piceance Basin in northwestern Colorado, additional production came on line in September 2009 from the companys 100 percent-owned and operated natural-gas development.

AIOC operations are conducted under a 30-year production-sharing contract (PSC) that expires in 2024. Kazakhstan: Chevron holds a 20 percent nonoperated working interest in the Karachaganak project, which is being developed in phases. During 2009, Karachaganak net oil-equivalent production averaged 69,000 barrels per day, composed of 42,000 barrels of liquids and 161 million cubic feet of natural gas. In 2009, access to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) and Atyrau-Samara (Russia) pipelines enabled approximately 184,000 barrels per day (33,000 net barrels) of Karachaganak liquids to be sold at world-market ##TABLE_END prices. The remaining liquids were sold into Russian markets. During 2009, work continued on a fourth train that is designed to increase total export of processed liquids by 56,000 barrels per day. The fourth train is expected to start-up in 2011. During 2009, Chevron and its partners continued to evaluate alternatives for a Phase III development of Karachaganak. Timing for the recognition of Phase III proved reserves is uncertain and depends on finalizing a project design and achieving project milestones. Karachaganak operations are conducted under a 40-year PSC that expires in 2038. Equity Affiliate Operations: The company holds a 50 percent interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which is operating and developing the Tengiz and Korolev crude-oil fields, located in western Kazakhstan, under a 40-year concession that expires in 2033. Chevrons net oil-equivalent production in 2009 from these fields averaged 274,000 barrels per day, composed of 226,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 289 million cubic feet of natural gas. In 2009, TCO continued ramp-up of the Sour Gas Injection (SGI) and Second Generation Plant (SGP) facilities. The SGI facility injects approximately one-third of the sour gas separated from the crude oil back into the reservoir. The injected gas maintains higher reservoir pressure and displaces oil towards producing wells. TCO is evaluating options for another expansion project based on SGI/SGP technologies. During 2009, the majority of TCOs crude-oil production was exported through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline that runs from Tengiz in Kazakhstan to tanker-loading facilities at Novorossiysk on the Russian coast of the Black Sea.

Proved reserves have been recognized for the project. The NWS Venture is also advancing plans to extend the period of crude-oil production. The NWS Oil Redevelopment Project is designed to replace the present floating production, storage and offloading vessel and a portion of existing subsea infrastructure that services production from the Cossack, Hermes, Lambert and Wanaea offshore fields. In 2009, work commenced on conversion of the replacement vessel. The project is expected to start-up in early 2011 and extend production past 2020. The concession for the NWS Venture expires in 2034. On Barrow and Thevenard islands off the northwest coast of Australia, Chevron operates crude-oil producing facilities that had combined net production of 4,000 barrels per day in 2009. Chevrons interests in these operations are 57.1 percent for Barrow and 51.4 percent for Thevenard. Also off the northwest coast of Australia, Chevron holds significant equity interests in the large natural-gas resource of the Greater Gorgon Area. The company initially held a 50 percent ownership interest across most of the area and is the operator of the Gorgon Project. Chevron and its joint-venture partners are proceeding with the combined development of Gorgon and nearby natural-gas fields as one large-scale project. Environmental approval from the Australian Commonwealth Government was issued in August 2009. In September 2009, the company announced the final investment decision and total estimated project costs for the first phase of development of $37 billion (AU$ 43 billion). The projects scope includes a three-train, 15 million-metric-ton-per-year LNG facility; a carbon sequestration project; and a domestic natural-gas plant. Natural gas for the project is expected to be supplied from the Gorgon and Io/Jansz fields. In 2009, long-term, binding agreements were finalized with four Asian customers for the delivery of about 4.4 million metric tons per year of LNG from the Gorgon Project. Equity sales agreements with three of the customers reduced Chevrons interest in the project to 47.3 percent at the end of 2009. Nonbinding Heads of Agreements (HOA) for delivery of an additional 2.1 million metric tons per year of LNG were also signed with three additional Asian customers in 2009 and early 2010. Negotiations continue to finalize binding sales agreements, which would bring LNG delivery commitments to a combined total of about 90 percent of Chevrons share of LNG from the project. During 2009, the company recognized proved reserves for the Greater Gorgon Area fields included in the project. First production of natural gas from these fields is expected in 2014. The projects estimated economic life exceeds 40 years from the time of start-up. Development of the companys majority-owned and operated Wheatstone and Iago fields, located offshore Western Australia, continued with the project entering front-end engineering and design (FEED) in July 2009. Chevron operates the project and plans to supply natural gas to its 75 percent-owned and operated LNG facilities from two 100 percent-owned licenses comprising the majority of the Wheatstone Field and part of the nearby Iago Field. In October 2009, agreements were signed with two companies to join the Wheatstone Project as combined 25 percent LNG facility owners and suppliers of natural gas for the projects first two LNG trains. In December 2009 and January 2010, nonbinding HOAs were signed with two Asian customers to take delivery of 4.9 million tons of LNG per year from the project, representing about 60 percent of the total LNG available from the foundation project. In addition, under these same HOAs the parties would acquire a combined 16.8 percent nonoperated working interest in the Wheatstone Field licenses and a 12.6 percent interest in the foundation natural-gas processing facilities at the final investment decision. At the end of 2009, the company had not recognized proved reserves for this project. In the Browse Basin, the company continued engineering and survey work on two potential development concepts for the Brecknock, Calliance and Torosa fields. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been recognized. In May 2009, the company announced the successful completion of a well at the Clio prospect to further explore and appraise the 66.7 percent-owned Block WA-205-P. In 2009 and early 2010, the company also announced natural-gas discoveries at the Kentish Knock prospect in the 50 percent-owned Block WA-365-P, the Achilles and Satyr prospects in the 50 percent-owned Block WA-374-P and the Yellowglen prospect in the 50 percent-owned WA-268-P Block. All prospects are Chevron-operated. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been recognized. ##TABLE_START      Argentina: Chevron holds operated interests in eight concessions in the Neuquen Basin. Working interests range from 18.8 percent to 100 percent. Net oil-equivalent production in 2009 averaged 38,000 barrels per day, composed of 33,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 27 million cubic feet of natural gas. The company also holds a 14 percent interest in the Oleoductos del Valle S.A. pipeline. In 2009, Chevron sold its oil and gas concession in the Austral Basin and its interest in the Confluencia Field in the Neuquen Basin. Brazil: Chevron holds working interests in three deepwater blocks in the Campos Basin. Chevron also holds a nonoperated working interest in one block in the Santos Basin. Net oil-equivalent production in 2009 averaged 2,000 barrels per day. The Frade Field, located in the Campos Basin, achieved first oil in June 2009. Chevron is the operator and has a 51.7 percent interest in the field. Additional development drilling is under way, with an estimated maximum total production of 72,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day. The concession that includes the Frade project expires in 2025. In the partner-operated Campos Basin Block BC-20, two areas  37.5 percent-owned Papa-Terra and 30 percent-owned Maromba  were retained for developmentfollowing the end of the exploration phase of this block. The Papa-Terra project progressed through FEED, and a ##TABLE_END final investment decision was made in January 2010. The project operator estimates total costs of $5.2 billion and expects first production in 2013. The facility is expected to be capable of producing up to 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Evaluation of design options for Maromba continued into 2010. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been recognized for these projects. In the Santos Basin, evaluation of investment options continued into 2010 for the 20 percent-owned and partner-operated Atlanta and Oliva fields. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been recognized for these fields. Colombia: The company operates the offshore Chuchupa and the onshore Ballena and Riohacha natural-gas fields as part of the Guajira Association contract. In exchange, Chevron receives 43 percent of the production for the remaining life of each field and a variable production volume from a fixed-fee Build-Operate-Maintain-Transfer agreement based on prior Chuchupa capital contributions. Daily net production averaged 245 million cubic feet of natural gas in 2009. Trinidad and Tobago: Company interests include 50 percent ownership in three partner-operated blocks in the East Coast Marine Area offshore Trinidad, which includes the Dolphin and Dolphin Deep producing natural-gas fields and the Starfish discovery. Chevron also holds a 50 percent operated interest in the Manatee area of Block 6(d). Net production in 2009 averaged 199 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Incremental production associated with a new domestic sales agreement commenced at Dolphin in the third quarter 2009. Venezuela: The company operates in two exploratory blocks offshore Plataforma Deltana, with working interests of 60 percent in Block 2 and 100 percent in Block 3. Chevron also holds a 100 percent operated interest in the Cardon III exploratory block, located north of Lake Maracaibo in the Gulf of Venezuela. Petrleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), Venezuelas national crude-oil and natural-gas company, has the option to increase its ownership in each of the three company-operated blocks up to 35 percent upon declaration of commerciality. In February 2010, a Chevron-led consortium was selected to participate in a heavy-oil project composed of three blocks in the Orinoco Oil Belt of eastern Venezuela. The consortium is expected to acquire a 40 percent interest in the project, with PDVSA holding the remaining interest. The Loran Field in Block 2 is projected to provide the initial supply of natural gas for Delta Caribe LNG (DCLNG) Train 1, Venezuelas first LNG train. A DCLNG framework agreement was signed in 2008, which provides Chevron with a 10 percent nonoperated interest in the first train and the associated offshore pipeline. An interim operating agreement governing activities prior to a final investment decision was signed by Chevron and its Train 1 partners in March 2009. In May 2009, the company relinquished part of Block 3 and retained the portion containing the 2005 Macuira natural-gas discovery. An unsuccessful exploration well was drilled in the Cardon III block in 2009. The company plans to continue to evaluate exploration potential in the Cardon III block in 2010. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been recognized in these exploratory blocks. Equity Affiliate Operations: Chevron also holds interests in two affiliates located in western Venezuela and in one affiliate in the Orinoco Belt. Chevron has a 30 percent interest in the Petropiar affiliate that operates the Hamaca heavy-oil production and upgrading project located in Venezuelas Orinoco Belt, a 39.2 percent interest in the Petroboscan affiliate that operates the Boscan Field in the western part of the country, and a 25.2 percent interest in the Petroindependiente affiliate that operates the LL-652 Field in Lake Maracaibo. The companys share of average net oil-equivalent production during 2009 from these operations was 54,000 barrels per day, composed of 51,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 23 million cubic feet of natural gas. ##TABLE_START      Canada: Company activities in Canada include nonoperated working interests of 26.9 percent in the Hibernia Field and 26.6 percent in the Hebron Field, both offshore eastern Canada, and 20 percent in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP) and operated interests of 60 percent in the Ells River Oil Sands Project. Excluding volumes mined at AOSP, average net oil-equivalent production during 2009 was 28,000 barrels per day, composed of 27,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 4 million cubic feet of natural gas. Substantially all of this production was from the Hibernia Field, where the working interest owners are also pursuing development of the Hibernia Southern Extension (HSE). Development of the HSE nonunitized area was approved by the provincial regulator in 2009, and the first producing well for the project was completed at year-end. ##TABLE_END In February 2010, binding agreements were signed with the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador on the development of the HSE unitized area, providing Chevron with a 23.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized area. For Hebron, agreements were reached during 2008 with the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador that allow development activities to begin. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project. At AOSP, the companys production from oil sands (for upgrading into synthetic oil) averaged 26,000 barrels per day during 2009. The first phase of an expansion project is under way and is expected to increase total production from oil sands by 100,000 barrels per day. The expansion would increase total AOSP design capacity to more than 255,000 barrels per day in late 2010. The projected cost of this expansion is $14.3 billion. The Ells River project consists of heavy-oil leases of more than 85,000 acres (344 sq km). The area contains significant volumes with potential for recovery by using Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage, an industry-proven technology that employs steam and horizontal drilling to extract the production from oil sands through wells rather than through mining operations. Additional field appraisal activity is not planned in the near-term. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been recognized. The company also holds exploration leases in the Mackenzie Delta and Beaufort Sea region, including a 34 percent nonoperated working interest in the offshore Amauligak discovery. Three exploration wells were drilled on company leases in the Mackenzie Delta region in 2009, and assessment of development concept alternatives for Amauligak continues. The company holds additional exploration acreage in eastern Labrador and the Orphan Basin. In 2009, the company was also successful in acquiring a western Canada lease position to explore for shale gas. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been recognized for any of these areas. Greenland: Processing of the 2-D seismic survey acquired over License 2007/26 in Block 4 offshore West Greenland in 2008 continued in 2009, and evaluation will commence in the first-half 2010. Chevron has a 29.2 percent nonoperated working interest in this exploration license. ##TABLE_START      Denmark: Chevron has a 15 percent working interest in the partner-operated Danish Underground Consortium (DUC), which produces crude oil and natural gas from 15 fields in the Danish North Sea.

DUC development activity in the region includes the ongoing Halfdan Phase IV project, which achieved first production in July 2009. Faroe Islands: Chevron withdrew from License 008 in 2009, but continues to assess exploration opportunities in the area. Netherlands: Chevron operates and holds interests ranging from 34.1 percent to 80 percent in eight blocks in the Dutch sector of the North Sea. In 2009, the companys net oil-equivalent production from the five producing blocks was 9,000 barrels per day, composed of 2,000 barrels of crude oil and 41 million cubic feet of natural gas. In 2009 Chevron divested its 48 percent interest in the L11/b license. ##TABLE_END Norway: The company holds a 7.6 percent interest in the partner-operated Draugen Field. The companys net production averaged 5,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day during 2009. In 2009, Chevron was awarded a 40 percent working interest as operator of the exploration license PL 527 in the deepwater portion of the Norwegian Sea. Data acquisition was completed on a 2-D seismic survey, and evaluation is under way. Poland: In December 2009, Chevron was awarded three five-year exploration licenses in the Zwierzyniec, Kransnik and Frampol concessions, and in February 2010, Chevron acquired the exploration rights to the Grabowiec concession. Chevron has a 100 percent-owned and operated interest in these four concessions to explore for shale gas. United Kingdom: The companys average net oil-equivalent production in 2009 from 10 offshore fields was 110,000 barrels per day, composed of 73,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 222 million cubic feet of natural gas. Most of the production was from the 85 percent-owned and operated Captain Field, the 23.4 percent-owned and operated Alba Field and the 32.4 percent-owned and jointly operated Britannia Field. Evaluation of development alternatives continued during 2009 for the 19.4 percent-owned and partner-operated Clair Phase 2 project west of the Shetland Islands. In the 40 percent-owned and operated Rosebank/Lochnagar area northwest of the Shetland Islands, an exploration well in Rosebank North was completed in the second quarter 2009 and an appraisal well in Rosebank/Lochnagar was completed in the third quarter 2009. Also northwest of the Shetland Islands, a three-well exploration and appraisal drilling program was completed in 2009 at the Cambo prospect. Technical studies have commenced to select a preferred development alternative. Additional exploration drilling in the region is expected to occur in the second-half 2010. As of the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been recognized for any of these prospects. In February 2010, the company sold its 10 percent nonoperated interest in the Laggan/Tormore discovery. Sales of Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids The company sells natural gas and natural gas liquids from its producing operations under a variety of contractual arrangements. In addition, the company also makes third-party purchases and sales of natural gas and natural gas liquids in connection with its trading activities. During 2009, U.S. and international sales of natural gas were 5.9 billion and 4.1 billion cubic feet per day, respectively, which includes the companys share of equity affiliates sales. Outside the United States, substantially all of the natural-gas sales from the companys producing interests are from operations in Australia, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Latin America, the Philippines, Thailand and the United Kingdom. U.S. and international sales of natural gas liquids were 161 thousand and 111 thousand barrels per day, respectively, in 2009. Substantially all of the international sales of natural gas liquids are from company operations in Africa, Australia and Indonesia.

None of the preferred shares had been converted as of February 2010. 3 Includes 3,000, 6,000 and 35,000 barrels per day of refinery inputs in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, for interests in refineries that were sold during those periods. ##TABLE_END Average crude oil distillation capacity utilization during 2009 was 91 percent, compared with 87 percent in 2008, largely a result of improved utilization at the refineries in Mississippi, Canada and Thailand. At the U.S. fuel refineries, crude oil distillation capacity utilization averaged 96 percent in 2009, compared with 95 percent in 2008, and cracking and coking capacity utilization averaged 85 percent and 86 percent in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cracking and coking units are the primary facilities used in fuel refineries to convert heavier feedstocks into gasoline and other light products. The companys refineries in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, South Africa and Australia produce low-sulfur fuels. During 2009, GS Caltex, the companys 50 percent-owned affiliate, continued construction on a new heavy-oil hydrocracker designed to increase high-value product yield and lower feedstock costs at the Yeosu, South Korea complex. Project completion is expected in 2010. Modifications were completed in 2009 that enable the companys 50 percent-owned Singapore Refining Companys refinery to meet regional specifications for clean diesel fuels. At the Pascagoula Refinery, construction progressed on a continuous catalytic reformer that is expected to improve refinery reliability. Planning continued for a premium base-oil facility at the companys Pascagoula Refinery. The facility is being designed to produce approximately 25,000 barrels per day of premium base oil for use in manufacturing high-performance lubricants, such as motor oils for consumer and commercial applications. At the refinery in El Segundo, California, design, engineering and construction work advanced during 2009 on projects that will reduce feedstock costs and improve yields. At the beginning of 2009, Chevron held a 5 percent interest in Reliance Petroleum Limited, a company formed by Reliance Industries Limited to construct a new refinery in Jamnagar, India. During the year, the company sold its 5 percent interest to Reliance Industries Limited. Chevron processes imported and domestic crude oil in its U.S. refining operations. Imported crude oil accounted for about 85 percent and 88 percent of Chevrons U.S. refinery inputs in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Gas-to-Liquids In Nigeria, Chevron and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation are developing a 33,000 barrel-per-day gas-to-liquids facility at Escravos designed to process 325 million cubic feet per day of natural gas supplied from the Phase 3A expansion of the Escravos Gas Plant (EGP).

The project completion is anticipated in the second quarter 2010. Work commenced in late 2009 to bring the Cal-Ky Pipeline, which was decommissioned in 2002, back into crude-oil service as a supply line for the Pascagoula Refinery. This crude-oil pipeline is also expected to provide additional outlets for the companys equity production. The pipeline is expected to return to service in 2011. The company is also leading the evaluation and negotiations associated with a 136 mile, 24-inch pipeline from the proposed Jack and St. Malo production facility to Green Canyon 19 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In December 2009, the company sold its interest in the western portion of the Texaco Expanded NGL Distribution System and its 64 percent ownership interest in Southcap Pipeline Company, which included Chevrons 13.4 percent ownership interest in the Capline Pipeline. Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) affiliate. CPC operates a crude-oil export pipeline from the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. During 2009, CPC transported an average of approximately 743,000 barrels of crude oil per day, including 597,000 barrels per day from Kazakhstan and 146,000 barrels per day from Russia. In December 2009, partners approved the Expansion Project Implementation Plan, which is expected to increase the pipeline capacity to 1.4 million barrels per day. A final investment decision is expected in late 2010. The company has an 8.9 percent interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) affiliate that owns and operates a pipeline that primarily transports crude oil produced by Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC) (owned 10.3 percent by Chevron) from Baku, Azerbaijan, through Georgia to deepwater port facilities in Ceyhan, Turkey.

The companys U.S.-flagged fleet is engaged primarily in transporting refined products between the Gulf Coast and the East Coast and from California refineries to terminals on the West Coast and in Alaska and Hawaii. As part of its fleet modernization program, the company has two U.S.-flagged tankers scheduled for delivery in 2010 and plans to retire three U.S.-flagged product tankers between 2010 and 2011. The new tankers are expected to bring improved efficiencies to Chevrons U.S.-flagged fleet. The foreign-flagged vessels are engaged primarily in transporting crude oil from the Middle East, Asia, the Black Sea, Mexico and West Africa to ports in the United States, Europe, Australia and Asia. The companys foreign-flagged vessels also transport refined products to and from various locations worldwide. In addition to the vessels described above, the company owns a one-sixth interest in each of seven liquefied-natural-gas (LNG) tankers transporting cargoes for the North West Shelf (NWS) Venture in Australia. The NWS project also has two LNG tankers under long-term time charter. The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 requires the phase-out by year-end 2010 of all single-hull tankers trading to U.S. ports or transferring cargo in waters within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. As of the end of 2009, the companys owned and chartered fleet was completely double-hulled. The company is a member of many oil-spill-response cooperatives in areas in which it operates around the world. Chemicals Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) is equally owned with ConocoPhillips Corporation. At the end of 2009, CPChem owned or had joint-venture interests in 34 manufacturing facilities and five research and technical centers in Belgium, Brazil, China, Colombia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea and the United States. During 2009, CPChem completed construction of the 22 million-pounds-per-year Ryton  polyphenylene-sulfide (PPS) manufacturing facility at Borger, Texas. Ryton  PPS is an engineering thermoplastic used in a variety of applications, including automotives and electronics. Outside the United States, CPChems 35 percent-owned Saudi Polymers Company continued construction during 2009 on a petrochemical project in Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia. The joint-venture project includes an olefins unit and downstream polyethylene, polypropylene, 1-hexene and polystyrene units. Project completion is expected in 2011. CPChem continued construction during 2009 on the 49 percent-owned Q-Chem II project, located in both Mesaieed and Ras Laffan, Qatar. The project includes a 350,000-metric-ton-per-year high-density polyethylene plant and a 345,000-metric-ton-per-year normal alpha olefins plant, each utilizing CPChem proprietary technology. These plants are located adjacent to the existing Q-Chem I complex. The Q-Chem II project also includes a separate joint venture to develop a 1.3 million-metric-ton-per-year ethylene cracker in Ras Laffan, in which Q-Chem II owns 54 percent of the capacity rights. Start-up for the ethylene cracker is expected in March 2010, and start-up for the polyethylene and alpha olefins plants is anticipated in the third quarter 2010. Chevrons Oronite brand lubricant and fuel additives business is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of performance additives for lubricating oils and fuels. The company owns and operates facilities in Brazil, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United States and has equity interests in facilities in India and Mexico. Oronite lubricant additives are blended into refined base oil to produce finished lubricant packages used in most engine applications, such as passenger car, heavy-duty diesel, marine, locomotive and motorcycle engines, and additives for fuels to improve engine performance and extend engine life. During 2009, production began at the detergent expansion facility in Palau Sakra, Singapore. This additional capacity enhances the companys ability to produce detergent components for applications in marine and automotive engines. Other Businesses Mining Chevrons U.S.-based mining company produces and markets coal and molybdenum. Sales occur in both U.S. and international markets. The company owns and is the operator of a surface coal mine in Kemmerer, Wyoming, an underground coal mine, North River, in Alabama, and a surface coal mine in McKinley, New Mexico. The company continues to actively market for sale its coal reserves at the North River Mine and elsewhere in Alabama. The decision was made in late 2009 to suspend production at the McKinley Mine, and conduct reclamation activities in 2010. The company also owns a 50 percent interest in Youngs Creek Mining Company LLC, which was formed to develop a coal mine in northern Wyoming. Coal sales from wholly owned mines in 2009 were 10 million tons, down about 1 million tons from 2008. At year-end 2009, Chevron controlled approximately 193 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in the United States, including reserves of low-sulfur coal. The company is contractually committed to deliver between 7 million and 9 million tons of coal per year through the end of 2012 and believes it will satisfy these contracts from existing coal reserves. In addition to the coal operations, Chevron owns and operates the Questa molybdenum mine in New Mexico. At year-end 2009, Chevron controlled approximately 53 million pounds of proven molybdenum reserves at Questa. Underground development and production plans at Questa were scaled back in 2009 in response to weakening prices for molybdenum. Power Generation Chevrons power generation business has interests in 13 power assets with a total operating capacity of more than 3,100 megawatts, primarily through joint ventures in the United States and Asia. Twelve of these are efficient combined-cycle and gas-fired cogeneration facilities that utilize waste heat recovery to produce electricity and support industrial thermal hosts. The thirteenth facility is a wind farm, located in Casper, Wyoming, that began operating in late 2009. The 100 percent-owned and operated Casper Wind Farm is a small-scale wind power facility designed to optimize the efficient use of a decommissioned refinery site for delivery of clean, renewable energy to the local utility provider. The company has major geothermal operations in Indonesia and the Philippines and is investigating several advanced solar technologies for use in oil-field operations as part of its renewable-energy strategy. For additional information on the companys geothermal operations and renewable energy projects, refer to page 18 and Research and Technology below. Chevron Energy Solutions Chevron Energy Solutions (CES) is a wholly owned subsidiary that designs and implements sustainable solutions for public institutions and businesses to increase energy efficiency and reliability, reduce energy costs, and utilize renewable and alternative-power technologies. Since 2000, CES has developed hundreds of projects that help governments, educational institutions and other customers reduce their energy costs and environmental impact. Major projects completed by CES in 2009 included solar and energy-efficiency installations for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the San Jose Unified School District, which were the largest projects of their kind for a U.S. transit authority and school district. Research and Technology The companys energy technology organization supports Chevrons upstream and downstream businesses by providing technology, services and competency development in earth sciences; reservoir and production engineering; drilling and completions; facilities engineering; manufacturing; process technology; catalysis; technical computing; and health, environment and safety. The information technology organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data management, security and network technology to provide a standardized digital infrastructure and enable Chevrons global operations and business processes. Chevron Technology Ventures (CTV) manages investments and projects in emerging energy technologies and their integration into Chevrons core businesses. As of the end of 2009, CTV continued to explore technologies such as next-generation biofuels and advanced solar. Chevrons research and development expenses were $603 million, $702 million and $510 million for the years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain. The companys overall investment in this area is not significant to the companys consolidated financial position. Environmental Protection Virtually all aspects of the companys businesses are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to similar laws and regulations in other countries. These regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. Most of the costs of complying with the many laws and regulations pertaining to its operations are, or are expected to become, embedded in the normal costs of conducting business. In 2009, the companys U.S. capitalized environmental expenditures were approximately $887 million, representing approximately 15 percent of the companys total consolidated U.S. capital and exploratory expenditures. These environmental expenditures include capital outlays to retrofit existing facilities as well as those associated with new facilities. The expenditures relate mostly to air- and water-quality projects and activities at the companys refineries, oil and gas producing facilities, and marketing facilities. For 2010, the company estimates U.S. capital expenditures for environmental control facilities will be approximately $831 million. The future annual capital costs are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements. Chevron expects an increase in environment-related regulations, including those that are intended to address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change, in the countries where it has operations. For instance, under Californias Global Warming Solutions Act enacted in 2006, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), charged with implementing the law, has adopted a new low-carbon fuel standard intended to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels, which is expected to apply beginning in 2011. Additionally, CARB is expected to propose regulations to implement the cap and trade emissions regulation provisions of the law, for adoption in the second half 2010. The effect of any such regulation on the companys business is uncertain. Refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on pages FS-16 through FS-17 for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron and on the companys 2009 environmental expenditures, remediation provisions and year-end environmental reserves. Refer also to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 30 through 32 for a discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change.

The reports are also available at the SECs Web site at www.sec.gov . ##TABLE_START ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors ##TABLE_END Chevron is a major fully integrated petroleum company with a diversified business portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital and exploratory expenditures and to pay dividends. Nevertheless, some inherent risks could materially impact the companys financial results of operations or financial condition. Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices. Chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions and geopolitical risk. During extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil, the companys upstream earnings and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected. Upstream assets may also become impaired. The impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined-product sales. The scope of Chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources. The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if Chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions, the companys business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors. Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The companys operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes, including hurricanes, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, civil unrest and other political events, fires, earthquakes, explosions and system failures, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. Chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action. The company produces, transports, refines and markets materials with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the companys business. Chevron operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions on the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors. Political instability could harm Chevrons business. The companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have imposed restrictions, controls and taxes, and in others, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries. Internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may affect the companys operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. At December 31, 2009, 26 percent of the companys net proved reserves were located in Kazakhstan. The company also has significant interests in Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)-member countries including Angola, Nigeria and Venezuela and in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Twenty-two percent of the companys net proved reserves, including affiliates, were located in OPEC countries at December 31, 2009. Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase Chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for Chevrons products. Continued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the companys operations and financial results. International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. For instance, the Kyoto Protocol, Australias proposed legislation and Californias Global Warming Solutions Act, along with other actual or pending federal, state and provincial regulations, envision a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through market-based regulatory programs, technology-based or performance-based standards or a combination of them. The company is subject to existing greenhouse gas emissions limits in jurisdictions where such regulation is currently effective, including the European Union and New Zealand. In December 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final endangerment finding for greenhouse gases, which specifically found that emissions of six greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare and that greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and engines also contribute to such pollution. These findings do not themselves impose regulatory requirements. However, the agency is currently in the process of promulgating greenhouse gas emission standards for light-duty vehicles and regulations that would require certain stationary source facilities that exceed an as-yet undetermined threshold to obtain permits in advance, which permits could require implementation of so-called best available control technologies. In June 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives approved the American Clean Energy and Security Act. This is known as the Waxman-Markey bill, which includes provisions for a cap-and-trade program, aimed at controlling and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in the United States. At this time it is not possible to predict whether or when the U.S. Senate may act on climate change legislation, how any bill approved by the Senate will be reconciled with the Waxman-Markey legislation or whether any federal legislation will supersede the EPAs regulatory actions. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations, may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary by jurisdiction depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, the companys activities in it and market conditions. The companys exploration and production of crude oil, natural gas and various minerals such as coal; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys products result in greenhouse gas emissions that could well be regulated. Some of these activities, such as consumers and customers use of the companys products, as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the companys control. The effect of regulation on the companys financial performance will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the companys ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products. Material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products the company currently sells and adversely affect the companys sales volumes, revenues and margins. Changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operations performance in any given period. In preparing the companys periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and impairments to property, plant and equipment. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the companys business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_END Ecuador Chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the Superior Court of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, brought in May 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. The lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations, and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. Until 1992, Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of this consortium with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by Petroecuador. At the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the concession area, Texpet entered into a formal agreement with the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador for Texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to Texpets ownership share of the consortium. Pursuant to that agreement, Texpet conducted a three-year remediation program at a cost of $40 million. After certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the government granted Texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations. Based on the history described above, Chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit. As to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction over Chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in Ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to Texpet by the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador. With regard to the facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms that Texpets remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects Petroecuadors failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and Petroecuadors further conduct since assuming full control over the operations. In April 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending that the court assess $8 billion, which would, according to the engineer, provide financial compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other items, environmental remediation, health care systems, and additional infrastructure for Petroecuador. The engineers report also asserted that an additional $8.3 billion could be assessed against Chevron for unjust enrichment. The engineers report is not binding on the court. Chevron also believes that the engineers work was performed and his report prepared in a manner contrary to law and in violation of the courts orders. Chevron submitted a rebuttal to the report in which it asked the court to strike the report in its entirety. In November 2008, the engineer revised the report and, without additional evidence, recommended an increase in the financial compensation for purported damages to a total of $18.9 billion and an increase in the assessment for purported unjust enrichment to a total of $8.4 billion. Chevron submitted a rebuttal to the revised report, which the court dismissed. In September 2009, following the disclosure by Chevron of evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome , the judge presiding over the case petitioned to be recused. In late September 2009, the judge was recused, and in October 2009, the full chamber of the provincial court affirmed the recusal, resulting in the appointment of a new judge. Chevron filed motions to annul all of the rulings made by the prior judge, but the new judge denied these motions. The court has completed most of the procedural aspects of the case and could render a judgment at any time. Chevron will continue a vigorous defense of any attempted imposition of liability. In the event of an adverse judgment, Chevron would expect to pursue its appeals and vigorously defend against enforcement of any such judgment; therefore, the ultimate outcome  and any financial effect on Chevron  remains uncertain. Management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in this case. Due to the defects associated with the engineers report, management does not believe the report has any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). Moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). Government Proceedings In November 2008, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) proposed a civil penalty against the companys Sacramento, California, terminal for alleged violations between August and December 2007 of CARBs regulations governing the minimum concentration of additives in gasoline. Due to a computer programming error, the Sacramento terminals automatic dispensers had failed to inject additive detergent into a gasoline line. In November 2008, CARB proposed a civil penalty against the companys Richmond, California, refinery for a notice of violation relating to gasoline that was not properly certified as to composition. The company corrected the composition certificates for the gasoline without requiring any change to the composition of the gasoline. In July 2009, CARB issued the refinery a notice of violation relating to an error in gasoline blending that caused the product composition certifications to be in error. The composition certifications were corrected without requiring any change to the gasoline. Discussions with CARB officials relating to all of these matters took place in the fourth quarter 2009 and continue in 2010. In July 2009, the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) alleged that Chevron is obligated to pay stipulated civil penalties exceeding $100,000 in conjunction with commitments the company undertook to install and operate certain air pollution abatement equipment at its Hawaii Refinery pursuant to Clean Air Act settlement with the United States Environmental Protection Agency and DOH. The company has disputed many of the allegations. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders ##TABLE_END None. PART II ", "5": " Item 5.

Business ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (a) General Development of Business ##TABLE_END Summary Description of Chevron Chevron Corporation, * a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations, mining operations, power generation and energy services. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids project. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. A list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on pages E-4 and E-5. As of December 31, 2010, Chevron had approximately 62,000 employees (including about 3,900 service station employees). Approximately 30,000 employees (including about 3,600 service station employees), or 48 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. Overview of Petroleum Industry Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors, and individual petroleum companies have little control over some of them. Governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment have a significant impact on petroleum activities, regulating how companies are structured and where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limiting their profits directly. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand for these commodities. However, some governments impose price controls on refined products such as gasoline or diesel fuel. The members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are typically the worlds swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in the companys quarterly earnings during the year. Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron also competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets. Operating Environment Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-10 of this Form 10-K in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the companys current business environment and outlook. * Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term Chevron and such terms as the company, the corporation, our, we and us may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise it does not include affiliates of Chevron  i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. Chevron Strategic Direction Chevrons primary objective is to create shareholder value and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream, the companys strategies are to grow profitably in core areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the companys equity natural gas resource base while growing a high-impact global gas business. In the downstream, the strategies are to improve returns and grow earnings across the value chain. The company also continues to utilize technology across all its businesses to differentiate performance, and to invest in profitable renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. ##TABLE_START (b) Description of Business and Properties ##TABLE_END The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2010, and assets as of the end of 2010 and 2009  for the United States and the companys international geographic areas  are in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page FS-41. Similar comparative data for the companys investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Notes 12 and 13 on pages FS-43 through FS-45. Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Total expenditures for 2010 were $21.8 billion, including $1.4 billion for the companys share of equity-affiliate expenditures. In 2009 and 2008, expenditures were $22.2 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively, including the companys share of affiliates expenditures of $1.6 billion in 2009 and $2.3 billion in 2008. Of the $21.8 billion in expenditures for 2010, 87 percent, or $18.9 billion, was related to upstream activities. Approximately 80 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2009 and 2008. International upstream accounted for about 82 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2010, more than 80 percent in 2009 and about 70 percent in 2008, reflecting the companys continuing focus on opportunities available outside the United States. In 2011, the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be $26.0 billion, including $2.0 billion of spending by affiliates. Approximately 85 percent of the total, or $22.6 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities, with $17.2 billion of that amount for projects outside the United States. Acquisition costs associated with the announced purchase of Atlas Energy, Inc., are not included. Refer also to a discussion of the companys capital and exploratory expenditures on page FS-13. Upstream The table on the following page summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2010 and 2009 by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production, including volumes from synthetic oil in 2010 and oil sands in 2009, was 2.763 million barrels per day, up about 2 percent from 2009. The increase was mainly associated with the start-up and ramp-up of several major capital projects  the expansion at Tengiz in Kazakhstan, the Tahiti Field in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Frade in Brazil, Agbami in Nigeria, and Tombua-Landana and Mafumeira Norte in Angola. Normal field declines and the impact of higher prices on cost-recovery volumes and other contractual provisions decreased net production from last years comparative period. Refer to the Results of Operations section beginning on page FS-7 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2008  2010 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and natural gas. The company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent production in 2011 will be approximately 2.790 million barrels per day based on the average West Texas Intermediate crude oil price of $79 per barrel in 2010. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including additional quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, price effects on production volumes calculated under production-sharing and variable-royalty provisions of certain agreements, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project startups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds, greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. Refer to the Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas, beginning on page 9, for a discussion of the companys major crude oil and natural gas development projects.

Wells that produce both crude oil and natural gas are classified as oil wells. 2 Gross wells include the total number of wells in which the company has an interest. Net wells include wholly owned wells and the sum of the companys fractional interests in gross wells. 3 Canadian synthetic oil is not produced through wells and therefore is not represented in the table above. ##TABLE_END Reserves Refer to Table V beginning on page FS-71 for a tabulation of the companys proved net crude oil and natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2008 and each year-end from 2008 through 2010. A discussion of reserves governance and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending December 31, 2010 is summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided beginning on page FS-71 regarding the nature of, status of and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations. During 2010, the company provided crude oil and natural gas reserves estimates for 2009 to the Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (EIA) that agree with the 2009 reserve volumes in Table V. This reporting fulfilled the requirement that such estimates be consistent with, and not differ more than 5 percent from, the information furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the companys 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During 2011, the company will file estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves with the Department of Energy, EIA, consistent with the 2010 reserve data reported in Table V. The net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years 2008 through 2010 are shown in the following table.

Net acreage includes wholly owned interests and the sum of the companys fractional interests in gross acreage. 2 Table does not include mining acreage associated with synthetic oil production in Canada. At year-end 2010, such undeveloped gross and net acreage totaled 222 and 31, respectively. Developed gross and net acreage associated with Canadian synthetic oil operations totaled 48 and 9, respectively. Developed acreage is acreage associated with productive mines. Undeveloped acreage is acreage on which mines have not been established and that may contain undeveloped proved reserves. 3 Developed acreage is spaced or assignable to productive wells. Undeveloped acreage is acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to permit commercial production and that may contain proved undeveloped reserves. The gross undeveloped acres that will expire in 2011, 2012 and 2013 if production is not established by certain required dates are 6,458, 2,672 and 5,996, respectively. ##TABLE_END Delivery Commitments The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver to third parties 253 billion cubic feet of natural gas through 2013. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the companys proved developed U.S. reserves and third party purchases. These contracts include a variety of pricing terms, including both index and fixed-price contracts. Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 953 billion cubic feet of natural gas from 2011 through 2013 from Australia, Colombia, Denmark and the Philippines to third parties. The sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the companys proved developed reserves in these countries. Development Activities Refer to Table I on page FS-66 for details associated with the companys development expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for 2010, 2009 and 2008. The table below summarizes the companys net interest in productive and dry development wells completed in each of the past three years and the status of the companys development wells drilling at December 31, 2010. A development well is a well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.

Net wells include wholly owned wells and the sum of the companys fractional interests in gross wells. ##TABLE_END Refer to Table I on page FS-66 for detail of the companys exploration expenditures and costs of unproved property acquisitions for 2010, 2009 and 2008. Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas Chevrons 2010 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page FS-2, are presented below. The comments include references to total production and net production, which are defined under Production in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-25. The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production and for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not the companys share of costs for projects that are less than wholly owned. ##TABLE_START      Chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the worlds major hydrocarbon basins. The companys upstream strategy is to grow profitably in core areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the companys equity natural gas resource base while growing a high-impact global gas business. The map at left indicates Chevrons primary areas of exploration and production. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START a) United States ##TABLE_END Upstream activities in the United States are concentrated in California, the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, the Rocky Mountains and Alaska. Average net oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2010 was 708,000 barrels per day. In California, the company has significant production in the San Joaquin Valley. In 2010, average net oil-equivalent production was 199,000 barrels per day, composed of 178,000 barrels of crude oil, 96 million cubic feet of natural gas and 5,000 barrels of natural gas liquids. Approximately 84 percent of the crude oil production is considered heavy oil (typically with API gravity lower than 22 degrees). ##TABLE_START      Average net oil-equivalent production during 2010 for the companys combined interests in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and deepwater areas, and the onshore fields in the region was 260,000 barrels per day. The daily oil-equivalent production was composed of 169,000 barrels of crude oil, 445 million cubic feet of natural gas and 17,000 barrels of natural gas liquids. In April 2010, an accident occurred at the BP-operated Macondo prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, resulting in a loss of life, the sinking of the rig and a significant oil spill. Chevron was not a participant in the well. Subsequent to the event, the U.S. Department of the Interior placed a moratorium on the drilling of wells using subsea blowout preventers (BOPs) or surface BOPs on a floating facility in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific ##TABLE_END regions. During the moratorium, Chevron participated in a number of industry efforts to identify opportunities to improve industry standards in prevention, intervention and spill response. In July 2010, Chevron and several other major energy companies announced plans to build and deploy a rapid response system that will be available to capture and contain oil in the unlikely event of a potential future well blowout in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In October 2010, the Secretary of the Interior lifted the moratorium on deepwater drilling activity, provided that operators certify compliance with new rules and requirements. The drilling moratorium and the ensuing slowdown in issuing drilling permits have resulted in delays in shallow water drilling activity, delayed drilling of exploratory deepwater wells and impacted development drilling on both operated and nonoperated projects in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the companys net oil-equivalent production in the Gulf of Mexico was reduced by about 10,000 barrels per day for the full year. Chevron was engaged in various exploration and development activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico during 2010. First oil at the Perdido Regional Development was achieved in first quarter 2010. The development includes a 37.5 percent nonoperated working interest in a producing host facility in Alaminos Canyon designed to service multiple nonoperated fields, including Chevrons 33.3 percent-owned Great White, 60 percent-owned Silvertip and 57.5 percent-owned Tobago. The development has an expected production life of approximately 25 years. The final investment decision was made for the Tahiti 2 waterflood project in third quarter 2010. Tahiti 2 is the second development phase for the 58 percent-owned and operated Tahiti Field and is designed to increase recovery and maintain production near the facility capacity of 125,000 barrels of oil per day. The project includes three water injection wells, two additional production wells and the facilities required to deliver water to the injection wells.

Cracking and coking units are the primary facilities used in fuel refineries to convert feedstocks into gasoline and other light products. Chevron processes both imported and domestic crude oil in its U.S. refining operations. Imported crude oil accounted for about 84 percent and 85 percent of Chevrons U.S. refinery inputs in 2010 and 2009, respectively. At the Pascagoula Refinery, the company commissioned a continuous catalytic reformer that is expected to improve equipment reliability and utilization and to allow the refinery to optimize production of high-value products. Also in Pascagoula, a final investment decision was reached in first quarter 2011 to construct a facility to produce approximately 25,000 barrels per day of premium base oil for use in manufacturing high-performance finished lubricants, such as motor oils for consumer and commercial applications. Project completion is expected by year-end 2013. At the refinery in El Segundo, construction began in late 2010 on a new processing unit designed to further improve the facilitys overall reliability, enhance high-value product yield and provide additional flexibility to process a broad range of crude slates. Project completion is expected in 2012. At the Richmond Refinery, the company continued to evaluate its options with respect to permitting of the Renewal Project. The project is designed to improve the refinerys ability to process higher sulfur crudes, without changing the refinerys capacity to process crude blends in the intermediate-light gravity range. Improved ability to process higher sulfur crudes is expected to provide increased flexibility to process lower API-gravity crudes within the refinerys existing capacity range. Refer also to a discussion of contingencies related to this project in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page FS-59. Outside the United States, GS Caltex, the companys 50 percent-owned affiliate, commissioned and reached full capacity on a new 60,000-barrel-per-day heavy-oil hydrocracker at the Yeosu Refinery in South Korea during 2010. Also at the Yeosu Refinery, GS Caltex announced plans to construct a 53,000-barrel-per-day gas oil fluid catalytic cracking unit. The unit is scheduled for start-up in 2013. Both units are designed to increase high-value product yield and lower feedstock costs. Construction began in 2010 on modifications to the 64 percent-owned Star Petroleum Refinery in Thailand to meet regional specifications for cleaner motor gasoline and diesel fuels. Project completion is scheduled for 2012. Also in 2010, the company solicited bids for the sale of certain operations in the United Kingdom and Ireland, including the Pembroke Refinery.

In South Korea, the company operates through its 50 percent-owned affiliate, GS Caltex, and in Australia through its 50 percent-owned affiliate, Caltex Australia Limited. The company progressed its ongoing effort to concentrate downstream resources and capital on strategic assets. In December 2010 and February 2011, the company completed the sale of fuels-marketing businesses in Malawi, Mauritius, Runion, Tanzania and Zambia. The company expects to complete the sale of its fuels-marketing businesses in Mozambique and Zimbabwe later in 2011, following receipt of required local regulatory and government approvals. In November 2010, the company signed an agreement for the sale of its fuels-marketing and aviation fuels businesses in Antigua, Barbados, Belize, Costa Rica, Dominica, French Guiana, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Martinique, Nicaragua, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Trinidad and Tobago and expects to complete all transactions by third quarter 2011, following receipt of required local regulatory and government approvals. In February 2011, the company announced an agreement to sell its fuels, finished lubricants and aviation fuels businesses in Spain. In 2010, the company also solicited bids for its fuels-marketing and aviation fuels businesses in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In addition, the company converted more than 150 company-operated service stations into retailer-owned sites in various countries outside the United States. Chevron markets commercial aviation fuel at approximately 200 airports, worldwide. The company also markets an extensive line of lubricant and coolant products under brand names including Havoline, Delo, Ursa, Meropa and Taro. Chemicals Operations Chevron owns a 50 percent interest in its Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) affiliate. At the end of 2010, CPChem owned or had joint-venture interests in 36 manufacturing facilities and four research and technical centers around the world. During 2010, CPChem commenced operations at its 49 percent-owned Q-Chem II project in both Mesaieed and Ras Laffan, Qatar. The project includes a 350,000-metric-ton-per-year high-density polyethylene plant and a 345,000-metric-ton-per-year normal alpha olefins plant in Mesaieed, each utilizing CPChems proprietary technology. Also included in the project is a separate joint venture for a 1.3 million-metric-ton-per-year ethylene cracker in Ras Laffan, in which Q-Chem II owns 54 percent of the capacity rights, which will provide ethylene feedstock to the high-density polyethylene and normal alpha olefins plants.

Work continued in 2010 to bring the Cal-Ky Pipeline, which was decommissioned in 2002, back into crude oil service as a supply line for the Pascagoula Refinery. This crude oil pipeline is also expected to provide additional outlets for the companys equity production. The pipeline is expected to return to service in 2012. The company is leading the construction of a 136 mile, 24-inch pipeline from the Jack/St. Malo facility to Green Canyon 19 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where there is an interconnect to pipelines delivering crude oil into Louisiana. In 2010, the company sold its 23.4 percent ownership interest in the Colonial Pipeline Company, which transports products from supply centers on the U.S. Gulf Coast to customers located along the Eastern seaboard. Refer to pages 16, 17 and 18 in the Upstream section for information on the Chad/Cameroon pipeline, the West Africa Gas Pipeline, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline, the Western Route Export Pipeline and the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. Tankers: All tankers in Chevrons controlled seagoing fleet were utilized during 2010. At any given time during 2010, the company had 41 deep-sea vessels chartered on a voyage basis, or for a period of less than one year. Additionally, the table on the following page summarizes the capacity of the companys controlled fleet.

The companys U.S.-flagged fleet is engaged primarily in transporting refined products between the Gulf Coast and the East Coast and from California refineries to terminals on the West Coast and in Alaska and Hawaii. As part of its fleet modernization program, the company replaced two U.S.-flagged product tankers in 2010. The company plans to retire one additional U.S.-flagged product tanker in 2011. The new tankers are expected to bring improved efficiencies to Chevrons U.S.-flagged fleet. The foreign-flagged vessels are engaged primarily in transporting crude oil from the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Black Sea, Mexico and West Africa to ports in the United States, Europe, Australia and Asia. The companys foreign-flagged vessels also transport refined products to and from various locations worldwide. In addition to the vessels described above, the company owns a one-sixth interest in each of seven liquefied natural gas tankers transporting cargoes for the North West Shelf Venture in Australia. Chevrons fleet of owned and chartered tankers is completely double-hulled. The company is a member of many oil-spill-response cooperatives in areas in which it operates around the world. Other Businesses Mining Chevrons U.S.-based mining company produces and markets coal and molybdenum. Sales occur in both U.S. and international markets. The company owns and is the operator of an underground coal mine, North River, in Alabama, and surface coal mines in Kemmerer, Wyoming, and McKinley, New Mexico. The company also owns a 50 percent interest in Youngs Creek Mining Company, LLC, which was formed to develop a coal mine in northern Wyoming. As of early 2011, the sale of the North River Mine and other coal-related assets in Alabama was under negotiation. Additionally, in January 2011, the company announced the intent to divest its remaining coal mining operations. Activities related to full reclamation continued in 2010 at the companys McKinley, New Mexico, mine, which ceased coal production at the end of 2009. At year-end 2010, Chevron controlled approximately 189 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in the United States, including reserves of low-sulfur coal. The company is contractually committed to deliver between 7 million and 8 million tons of coal per year through the end of 2013 and believes it will satisfy these contracts from existing coal reserves. Coal sales from wholly owned mines in 2010 were 8 million tons, down about 2 million tons from 2009. In addition to the coal operations, Chevron owns and operates the Questa molybdenum mine in New Mexico. At year-end 2010, Chevron controlled approximately 53 million pounds of proven molybdenum reserves at Questa. Production and underground development at Questa continued at reduced levels in 2010 in response to weak prices for molybdenum. Power Generation Chevrons Global Power Company manages interests in 13 power assets with a total operating capacity of more than 3,100 megawatts, primarily through joint ventures in the United States and Asia. Twelve of these are efficient combined-cycle and gas-fired cogeneration facilities that utilize waste heat recovery to produce electricity and support industrial thermal hosts. The thirteenth facility is a wind farm, located in Casper, Wyoming, that is designed to optimize the use of a decommissioned refinery site for delivery of clean, renewable energy to the local utility. The company has major geothermal operations in Indonesia and the Philippines and is investigating several advanced solar technologies for use in oil field operations as part of its renewable-energy strategy. For additional information on the companys geothermal operations and renewable energy projects, refer to pages 21 and 22 and Research and Technology below. Chevron Energy Solutions (CES) CES is a wholly owned subsidiary that develops and builds sustainable energy projects to increase energy efficiency and renewable power, reduce energy costs, and ensure reliable, high-quality energy for government, education and business facilities. Since 2000, CES has developed hundreds of projects that help customers reduce their energy costs and environmental impact. Projects announced in 2010 include the City of Brea Energy Efficiency and Solar Project in California, the Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany Landfill Gas Project in Georgia, and the University of Utah Thermal Storage and New Central Plant Project. Research and Technology The companys energy technology organization supports Chevrons upstream and downstream businesses by providing technology, services and competency development in earth sciences; reservoir and production engineering; drilling and completions; facilities engineering; manufacturing; process technology; catalysis; technical computing; and health, environment and safety disciplines. The information technology organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data management, security and network technology to provide a standardized digital infrastructure and enable Chevrons global operations and business processes. Chevron Technology Ventures (CTV) manages investments and projects in emerging energy technologies and their integration into Chevrons core businesses. As of the end of 2010, CTV continued to explore technologies such as next-generation biofuels and advanced solar. In 2010, the company constructed and commissioned a one megawatt concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) solar facility on the tailing site of Chevrons molybdenum mine in Questa, New Mexico. This beneficial reuse project is one of the largest CPV installations in the world. Also in 2010, the company constructed and commissioned a 0.74 megawatt next generation solar photovoltaic installation on a former refinery site in Bakersfield, California. Seven solar panel technologies are being tested to establish the viability of these solar technologies at other Chevron sites. Chevrons research and development expenses were $526 million, $603 million and $702 million for the years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain. Environmental Protection Virtually all aspects of the companys businesses are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to similar laws and regulations in other countries. These regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. Most of the costs of complying with the many laws and regulations pertaining to its operations are, or are expected to become, embedded in the normal costs of conducting business. In 2010, the companys U.S. capitalized environmental expenditures were $639 million, representing about 12 percent of the companys total consolidated U.S. capital and exploratory expenditures. These environmental expenditures include capital outlays to retrofit existing facilities as well as those associated with new facilities. The expenditures relate mostly to air- and water-quality projects and activities at the companys refineries, oil and gas producing facilities, and marketing facilities. For 2011, the company estimates U.S. capital expenditures for environmental control facilities will be approximately $800 million. The future annual capital costs are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements. Environmental-related regulations, including those intended to address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change, continue to evolve. For instance, in December 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final endangerment finding for greenhouse gases, which found that emissions of six greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare. Greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and engines also contribute to such pollution. Subsequently, in 2010, the EPA finalized two regulations under the Clean Air Act that establish greenhouse gas emission standards for new light-duty vehicles and clarify preconstruction permitting requirements for new or modified stationary source facilities with greenhouse gas emissions that exceed 75,000 tons per year of carbon dioxide equivalent. In November 2010, the agency issued updated guidance on determining the best available control technologies (BACT) that would be required to be implemented by certain new and modified stationary source facilities beginning in January 2011, but there remains significant uncertainty regarding the impact of applying BACT requirements on a case by case basis. Finally, in two recent settlement agreements, the EPA agreed to schedules for undertaking additional greenhouse gas rulemakings applicable to utilities and refineries. The agency is beginning to develop these new regulations, which are scheduled to be effective in May 2012 (utilities) and November 2012 (refineries), so it is not possible to predict their impact at this time. The EPAs endangerment finding, motor vehicle greenhouse gas standards, and greenhouse gas permit rule have all been challenged in federal courts and decisions are pending. The EPA also finalized its revised Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) regulations as required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The regulations require fuel providers to blend increased volumes of renewable fuels into gasoline and diesel each year and establish specific greenhouse gas reduction and feedstock criteria for subcategories of renewable fuel, including cellulosic fuel, advanced biofuel and biomass-based diesel. The specific impacts of this regulation are determined by many factors, including fluctuating markets for renewable fuels and EPA regulatory decisions on potential waivers of volume requirements. Additionally, under Californias Global Warming Solutions Act, enacted in 2006, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), charged with implementing the law, has adopted a new low-carbon fuel standard intended to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels. The state is behind schedule in completing certain elements of the standard. Consequently, initial carbon intensity reduction requirements are effective as of January 2011, but CARB has delayed other aspects of compliance until it completes further updates to the regulation later in the year. In December 2010, CARB adopted regulations implementing the cap and trade program requirements of the Global Warming Solutions Act. The first compliance period of the cap and trade program begins in 2012 and ends in December 2014. CARB has yet to develop detailed regulations to implement this portion of the Act, including the determination of how emissions allowances will be allocated and traded during this period. The effect of any such regulation on the companys business is uncertain.

The reports are also available on the SECs Web site at www.sec.gov . ##TABLE_START ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors ##TABLE_END Chevron is a global energy company with a diversified business portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital and exploratory expenditures and to pay dividends. Nevertheless, some inherent risks could materially impact the companys financial results of operations or financial condition. Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices. Chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions and geopolitical risk. Chevron accepts the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process. As such, an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices. During extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil, the companys upstream earnings and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected. Upstream assets may also become impaired. The impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. The scope of Chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources. The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if Chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions, the companys business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors. Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The companys operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes beyond its control, including hurricanes, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, civil unrest and other political events, fires, earthquakes, explosions and system failures, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. The companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight. Chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of policies, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. Nonetheless, in certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. Chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action. The company produces, transports, refines and markets materials with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the companys business. Chevron operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions on the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. Political instability could harm Chevrons business. The companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have imposed restrictions, controls and taxes, and in others, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries. Internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may affect the companys operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. At December 31, 2010, 25 percent of the companys net proved reserves were located in Kazakhstan. The company also has significant interests in Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)-member countries including Angola, Nigeria and Venezuela and in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Twenty-three percent of the companys net proved reserves, including affiliates, were located in OPEC countries at December 31, 2010. Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase Chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for Chevrons products. Continued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it, and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the companys operations and financial results. International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. For instance, the Kyoto Protocol and Californias Global Warming Solutions Act, along with other actual or pending federal, state and provincial regulations, envision a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through market-based regulatory programs, technology-based or performance-based standards or a combination of them. The company is subject to existing greenhouse gas emissions limits in jurisdictions where such regulation is currently effective, including the European Union and New Zealand. In 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized two regulations under the Clean Air Act that establish greenhouse gas emission standards for new light-duty vehicles and clarify preconstruction permitting requirements for new or modified stationary source facilities with greenhouse gas emissions that exceed 75,000 tons per year of carbon dioxide equivalent. In addition, the EPA recently agreed to develop additional regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from utilities and refineries. The agency is beginning to develop these new regulations, which are scheduled to be effective in May 2012 (utilities) and November 2012 (refineries), so it is not possible to predict their impact at this time. The U.S. Congress has previously considered and may in the future consider legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At this time it is not possible to predict any specific Congressional actions in 2011 or beyond, and it is unclear how any such legislation would reconcile with the Clean Air Act or current EPA regulations. In December 2010, California adopted regulations implementing the cap and trade program requirements of the states Global Warming Solutions Act, also known as AB32. The first compliance period of the cap and trade program begins in 2012 and ends in December 2014. Chevron may incur costs associated with emissions reduction activities, and the purchase of allowances or credits for its facilities in California. In addition, Chevrons purchased energy costs from utilities may increase starting in January 2012, when electricity generators are required to purchase allowances or credits for electricity sold in California. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary by jurisdiction depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, the companys activities in it and market conditions. The companys exploration and production of crude oil, natural gas and various minerals such as coal; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys products result in greenhouse gas emissions that could well be regulated. Some of these activities, such as consumers and customers use of the companys products, as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the companys control. The effect of regulation on the companys financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the companys ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products. Material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products the company currently sells and adversely affect the companys sales volumes, revenues and margins. Changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operations performance in any given period. In preparing the companys periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and impairments to property, plant and equipment. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the companys business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_END Ecuador Chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the Superior Court of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, brought in May 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. The lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. Until 1992, Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of this consortium with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by Petroecuador. At the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the concession area, Texpet entered into a formal agreement with the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador for Texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to Texpets ownership share of the consortium. Pursuant to that agreement, Texpet conducted a three-year remediation program at a cost of $40 million. After certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the government granted Texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations. Based on the history described above, Chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit. As to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction over Chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in Ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to Texpet by the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and municipal governments. With regard to the facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms that Texpets remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects Petroecuadors failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and Petroecuadors further conduct since assuming full control over the operations. In 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending that the court assess $18.9 billion, which would, according to the engineer, provide financial compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other items, environmental remediation, health care systems and additional infrastructure for Petroecuador. The engineers report also asserted that an additional $8.4 billion could be assessed against Chevron for unjust enrichment. In 2009, following the disclosure by Chevron of evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome, the judge presiding over the case was recused. In 2010, Chevron moved to strike the mining engineers report and to dismiss the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the United States indicating that the report was prepared by consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as the mining engineers independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct. In August 2010, the judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineers report and requiring the parties to provide their positions on damages within 45 days. Chevron subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge, claiming that he had disregarded evidence of fraud and misconduct and that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory time requirement. In September 2010, Chevron submitted its position on damages, asserting that no amount should be assessed against it. The plaintiffs submission, which relied in part on the mining engineers report, took the position that damages are between approximately $16 billion and $76 billion and that unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between approximately $5 billion and $38 billion. The next day, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. Chevron petitioned to have that order declared a nullity in light of Chevrons prior recusal petition, and because procedural and evidentiary matters remain unresolved. In October 2010, Chevrons motion to recuse the judge was granted. A new judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judges order closing the evidentiary phase of the case. On December 17, 2010, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim in September 2009 against the Republic of Ecuador before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague under the Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. The claim alleges violations of the Republic of Ecuadors obligations under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) and breaches of the settlement and release agreements between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet (described above), which are investment agreements protected by the BIT. Through the arbitration, Chevron and Texpet are seeking relief against the Republic of Ecuador, including a declaration that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation constitutes a violation of Ecuadors obligations under the BIT. On February 9, 2011, the Permanent Court of Arbitration issued an Order for Interim Measures requiring the Republic of Ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case pending further order of the Tribunal. Chevron expects to continue seeking permanent injunctive relief and monetary relief before the Tribunal. Through a series of recent U.S. court proceedings initiated by Chevron to obtain discovery relating to the Lago Agrio litigation and the BIT arbitration, Chevron has obtained evidence that it believes shows a pattern of fraud, collusion, corruption, and other misconduct on the part of several lawyers, consultants and others acting for the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. In February 2011, Chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and other state laws. Through the civil lawsuit, Chevron is seeking relief that includes an award of damages and a declaration that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable. On February 8, 2011, the Court issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and persons acting in concert with them from taking any action in furtherance of recognition or enforcement of any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case until March 8, 2011. Chevrons motion for a preliminary injunction is presently before the Court. On February 14, 2011, the Provincial Court in Lago Agrio rendered an adverse judgment in the case. The Provincial Court rejected Chevrons defenses to the extent the Court addressed them in its opinion. The judgment assesses approximately $8.6 billion in damages and about $0.9 billion for the plaintiffs representatives. It also assesses an additional amount of approximately $8.6 billion in punitive damages unless the company provides a public apology. Chevron continues to believe the Courts judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable in Ecuador, the United States and other countries. The company also believes the judgment is the product of fraud, and contrary to the legitimate scientific evidence. Chevron will appeal this decision in Ecuador. Chevron cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the appeals process in Ecuador. Chevron will continue a vigorous defense of any imposition of liability. Because Chevron has no substantial assets in Ecuador, Chevron would expect enforcement actions as a result of this judgment to be brought in other jurisdictions. Chevron expects to contest any such actions. The ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on Chevron, remains uncertain. Management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in this case. Due to the defects associated with the judgment, the 2008 engineers report and the September 2010 plaintiffs submission, management does not believe these documents have any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). Moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). California Air Resources Board As reported in the companys annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, in November 2008, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) proposed a civil penalty against the companys Sacramento, California, terminal for alleged violations between August and December 2007 of CARBs regulations governing the minimum concentration of additives in gasoline. Due to a computer programming error, the Sacramento terminals automatic dispensers had failed to inject additive detergent into a gasoline line. As reported in the companys annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, in November 2008, CARB proposed a civil penalty against the companys Richmond, California, refinery for a notice of violation relating to gasoline that was not properly certified as to composition. The company corrected the composition certificates for the gasoline without requiring any change to the composition of the gasoline. In July 2009, CARB issued the refinery a notice of violation relating to an error in gasoline blending that caused the product composition certifications to be in error. The composition certifications were corrected without requiring any change to the gasoline. Discussions with CARB officials relating to all of these matters continue. As reported in the companys quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2010, on July 14, 2009, CARB issued a notice of violation against Chevron Products Company for alleged violations of CARBs regulations governing the certification of gasoline that occurred during storage at a third-party facility and which had been self-reported by the company on discovery. The company has determined that resolution of this matter may result in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000. Other Government Proceedings As reported in the companys annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, in July 2009, the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) alleged that Chevron is obligated to pay stipulated civil penalties exceeding $100,000 in conjunction with commitments the company undertook to install and operate certain air pollution abatement equipment at its Hawaii Refinery pursuant to Clean Air Act settlement with the United States Environmental Protection Agency and DOH. The company has disputed many of the allegations. As reported in the companys quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, in March 2010, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) indicated that it intends to seek a civil penalty against the companys service station operations in Puerto Rico for alleged violations of the Commonwealth of Puerto Ricos underground storage tank regulations. The alleged violations include failure to test leak detectors, perform release monitoring and maintain compliance records. The DOJs action may result in payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000. As reported in the companys quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, Chevron has entered into negotiations with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with respect to alleged air pollution violations at the companys Perth Amboy, New Jersey refinery identified in a September 16, 2008 Compliance Order issued by the EPA. The alleged violations relate to certain management and reporting requirements set forth in the EPAs Leak Detection and Repair regulations (these regulations pertain to the control and monitoring of fugitive emissions from refinery process equipment). Based on discussions with the EPA, it appears that the resolution of this matter will result in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000. In the fourth quarter 2010, Chevron paid the United States Department of Transportation a $423,000 civil penalty as the result of an 800 barrel crude oil spill that occurred on June 12, 2010. The spill originated from a pipeline that runs from the companys Rangely Colorado Field to its Salt Lake Refinery. The California Attorney General has alleged violations of the States underground storage tank regulations at the companys service stations in the State of California. The allegations are part of a state-wide enforcement action which the company determined in the fourth quarter 2010 may result in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000.

Business ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (a) General Development of Business ##TABLE_END Summary Description of Chevron Chevron Corporation, * a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations, mining operations, power generation and energy services. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids project. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. A list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on pages E-4 and E-5. As of December 31, 2011, Chevron had approximately 61,000 employees (including about 3,800 service station employees). Approximately 30,000 employees (including about 3,500 service station employees), or 49 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. Overview of Petroleum Industry Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. The members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are typically the worlds swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron also competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets. Operating Environment Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-8 of this Form 10-K in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the companys current business environment and outlook. * Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term Chevron and such terms as the company, the corporation, our, we and us may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise it does not include affiliates of Chevron  i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. Chevrons Strategic Direction Chevrons primary objective is to create shareholder value and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream, the companys strategies are to grow profitably in core areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the companys equity natural gas resource base while growing a high-impact global natural gas business. In the downstream, the strategies are to improve returns and grow earnings across the value chain. The company also continues to utilize technology across all its businesses to differentiate performance, and to invest in profitable renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. ##TABLE_START (b) Description of Business and Properties ##TABLE_END The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2011, and assets as of the end of 2011 and 2010  for the United States and the companys international geographic areas  are in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page FS-37. Similar comparative data for the companys investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Notes 12 and 13 on pages FS-39 through FS-41. Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Total expenditures for 2011 were $29.1 billion, including $1.7 billion for the companys share of equity-affiliate expenditures. In 2010 and 2009, expenditures were $21.8 billion and $22.2 billion, respectively, including the companys share of affiliates expenditures of $1.4 billion in 2010 and $1.6 billion in 2009. Of the $29.1 billion in expenditures for 2011, 89 percent, or $25.9 billion, was related to upstream activities. Approximately 87 and 80 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2010 and 2009, respectively. International upstream accounted for about 68 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2011, about 82 percent in 2010 and about 80 percent in 2009. These amounts exclude the acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc. in 2011. Refer to a discussion of the acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc., in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page FS-30. In 2012, the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be $32.7 billion, including $3 billion of spending by affiliates. Approximately 87 percent of the total, or $28.5 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities, with $22.3 billion, or about 78 percent, of this amount for projects outside the United States. Refer also to a discussion of the companys capital and exploratory expenditures on pages FS-11 through FS-12. Upstream The table on the following page summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2011 and 2010 by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production was 2.673 million barrels per day, down about three percent from 2010. The decrease was mainly associated with normal field declines, maintenance-related downtime and the impact of higher prices on entitlement volumes. The start-up and ramp-up of several major capital projects  the Perdido project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the expansion at the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in Canada, the Frade Field in Brazil, and the Platong II natural gas project in Thailand  as well as acquisitions in the Marcellus Shale, partially offset the decrease in net production from 2010. Refer to the Results of Operations section beginning on page FS-6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2009  2011 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and natural gas. The company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent production in 2012 will be approximately 2.680 million barrels per day based on the average Brent price of $111 per barrel in 2011. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, price effects on entitlement volumes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project startups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds, greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. Refer to the Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas, beginning on page 8, for a discussion of the companys major crude oil and natural gas development projects.

Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver to third parties 232 billion cubic feet of natural gas through 2014. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the companys proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These contracts include a variety of pricing terms, including both indexed and fixed-price contracts. Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 891 billion cubic feet of natural gas from 2012 through 2014 from operations in Australia, Colombia, Denmark and the Philippines to third parties. The sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the companys proved developed reserves in these countries. Development Activities Refer to Table I on page FS-62 for details associated with the companys development expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for 2011, 2010 and 2009. The table on the next page summarizes the companys net interest in productive and dry development wells completed in each of the past three years and the status of the companys development wells drilling at December 31, 2011.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas Chevrons 2011 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page FS-2, are presented below. The comments include references to total production and net production, which are defined under Production in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-11. The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production and for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not the companys share of costs for projects that are less than wholly owned. ##TABLE_START      Chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the worlds major hydrocarbon basins. The companys upstream strategy is to grow profitably in core areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the companys equity natural gas resource base while growing a high-impact global gas business. The map at left indicates Chevrons primary areas of exploration and production. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START a) United States ##TABLE_END Upstream activities in the United States are concentrated in California, the Gulf of Mexico, the Appalachian Basin, Colorado, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming and Alaska. Average net oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2011 was 678,000 barrels per day. In California, the company has significant production in the San Joaquin Valley. In 2011, average net oil-equivalent production was 183,000 barrels per day, composed of 165,000 barrels of crude oil, 83 million cubic feet of natural gas and 4,000 barrels of natural gas liquids. Approximately 84 percent of the crude oil production is considered heavy oil (typically with API gravity lower than 22 degrees). ##TABLE_START      Average net oil-equivalent production during 2011 for the companys combined interests in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and deepwater areas, and the onshore fields in the region was 244,000 barrels per day. The daily oil-equivalent production was composed of 161,000 barrels of crude oil, 401 million cubic feet of natural gas and 16,000 barrels of natural gas liquids. Chevron was engaged in various exploration and development activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico during 2011. The Jack and St. Malo fields are located within 25 miles of each other and are being jointly developed. Chevron has a 50 percent working interest in Jack and a 51 percent working interest in St. Malo. Both fields are company operated. All major installation contracts have been awarded and construction began for ##TABLE_END the floating production unit hull and topsides modules during 2011. Development drilling operations commenced in fourth quarter 2011. The facility is planned to have a design capacity of 177,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development, which is estimated to have maximum total daily production of 94,000 barrels of oil equivalent, plus production from a nearby third-party field. Total project costs for the initial phase of development are estimated at $7.5 billion and start-up is expected in 2014. The project has an estimated production life of 30 years. The initial recognition of proved reserves for the project occurred in 2011. Work continued at the 60 percent-owned and operated Big Foot discovery. The development plan includes a 15-slot drilling and production tension leg platform with water injection facilities and a design capacity of 79,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Fabrication of topsides, hull and other components began in first-half 2011 and initial development drilling commenced in fourth quarter 2011. First production is anticipated in 2014. The field has an estimated production life of 20 years. Initial proved reserves were recognized in 2011. Tahiti 2 is the second development phase for the 58 percent-owned and operated Tahiti Field and is designed to increase recovery and return well capacity to 125,000 barrels of oil per day. The project includes three water injection wells, two additional production wells and the water injection facilities required to deliver water to the injection wells. Two water injection wells have been completed and drilling commenced on the first production well in early 2012. The water injection facilities have been installed and water injection began in first quarter 2012. Start-up of the first production well of the second phase is expected by 2013. Initial proved reserves for the Tahiti 2 project were recognized in 2011, and the field has an estimated production life of 30 years. The final investment decision was made for the Tubular Bells deepwater project in fourth quarter 2011. The company has a 42.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Tubular Bells unitized area after receiving an additional 12.9 percent equity interest relinquished by a partner in 2011. Development drilling is scheduled to begin in second quarter 2012, and plans include three producing and two injection wells, with a subsea tieback to a third-party production facility. First oil is anticipated in 2014, and maximum total daily production is expected to reach 40,000 to 45,000 barrels of oil-equivalent. At the end of 2011, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project. The company has a 20.3 percent nonoperated working interest in the Caesar and Tonga unitized area. Development plans include a total of four wells and a subsea tieback to a nearby third-party production facility. Three of the four development wells have been drilled and completed as of year-end 2011. Drilling of the fourth well is expected to begin in mid-2012. Work on the subsea system, commissioning of the topsides and the initial well completion program continued into 2012. Installation of the production riser and first production are expected in mid-2012. Maximum total production is expected to be 46,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day. Proved reserves have been recognized for the project. The company has a 15.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the Mad Dog II Project. Front-end engineering and design (FEED) is expected to commence by second quarter 2012. It is anticipated that this future development would require new production facilities to support planned maximum total daily production of 120,000 to 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent. At the end of 2011, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project. Development planning and unitization talks with owners of an adjacent field continued in 2011 for the Knotty Head project. Chevron has a 25 percent nonoperated working interest in this subsalt, Green Canyon Block 512 discovery. At the end of 2011, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project. Deepwater exploration activities in 2011 included participation in four exploratory wells  two wildcats, one appraisal and one delineation. Following successful permitting under new, more stringent, U.S. Department of Interior guidelines, two wells resumed drilling activities after operations were halted in 2010 as a result of the deepwater drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico. Drilling operations at the 43.8 percent-owned and operated Moccasin prospect resumed in first quarter 2011 and resulted in a new discovery in the Lower Tertiary Wilcox Trend. Drilling operations resumed in second quarter 2011 at the 55 percent-owned and operated Buckskin prospect, resulting in a successful appraisal well. These two discoveries, located 12 miles apart, could facilitate future co-development upon the successful completion of additional appraisal drilling planned at each prospect in 2012. Drilling was terminated at the Coronado wildcat well due to drilling conditions in the shallow section of the wellbore. The company plans to drill a replacement well at an alternate location by mid-2012. Besides the activities connected with the development and exploration projects in the Gulf of Mexico, the company also has contracted capacity at the third-party Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification terminal in Louisiana and in a third-party pipeline system connecting the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to the natural gas pipeline grid. The pipeline provides access to two major salt dome storage fields and 10 major interstate pipeline systems, including access to Chevrons Sabine Pipeline, which connects to the Henry Hub. The Henry Hub interconnects to nine interstate and four intrastate pipelines and is the pricing point for natural gas futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. ##TABLE_START      Company activities outside California and the Gulf of Mexico include operated and nonoperated interests in properties across the mid-continental United States, the Appalachian Basin, Michigan, Ohio and Alaska. During 2011, the companys U.S. production outside California and the Gulf of Mexico averaged 251,000 net oil-equivalent barrels per day, composed of 91,000 barrels of crude oil, 795 million cubic feet of natural gas and 28,000 barrels of natural gas liquids. In West Texas, the company continues to pursue development of tight carbonates, tight sands, and liquids-rich shale resources in the Midland Basins Wolfcamp play and several plays in the Delaware Basin through use of advanced drilling and completion technologies. Additional production growth is expected from interests in these formations in ##TABLE_END future years. In February 2011, Chevron acquired Atlas Energy, Inc. The acquisition provided a natural gas resource position in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale, primarily located in southwestern Pennsylvania and Ohio. The acquisition also provided a 49 percent interest in Laurel Mountain Midstream, LLC, an affiliate that owns more than 1,000 miles of natural gas gathering lines servicing the Marcellus. In addition, the acquisition provided assets in Michigan, which include Antrim Shale producing assets and approximately 350,000 total acres in the Antrim and Collingwood/Utica Shale formations. Additional asset acquisitions in 2011 expanded the companys holdings in the Marcellus and Utica to approximately 700,000 and 600,000 total acres, respectively. In the Marcellus, 61 natural gas wells were completed in 2011. ##TABLE_START b) Other Americas ##TABLE_END Other Americas is composed of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Greenland, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.

Average net oil-equivalent production during 2011 was 70,000 barrels per day, composed of 69,000 barrels of crude oil, synthetic oil and natural gas liquids and 4 million cubic feet of natural gas. Development of the Hibernia Southern Extension is expected to stem the production decline from the Hibernia Field. The project includes drilling of producing wells from the existing Hibernia platform and subsea drilling of water injection wells. All project approvals were in place by early 2011 and two producing wells were successfully drilled ##TABLE_END from the platform to obtain early reservoir information. Further drilling is anticipated to commence in 2013 with full production start-up expected in 2014. The initial recognition of proved reserves occurred in 2011 for this project. FEED activities continued in 2011 for the development of the heavy-oil Hebron Field and a final investment decision is expected in 2013. The project has an expected economic life of 30 years. At the end of 2011, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project. At AOSP, oil sands are mined from both the Muskeg River and Jackpine mines and bitumen is extracted from the oil sands and upgraded into synthetic oil. The AOSP Expansion 1 Project activities continued in 2011 with completion of the Scotford Upgrader expansion, which increased daily production design capacity to approximately 255,000 barrels per day. During 2011, the company increased its shale exploration acreage in Alberta in the Duvernay formation. In third quarter 2011, a multiwell drilling program commenced on these 100 percent-owned and operated leases. A long-term well test is expected to begin in fourth quarter 2012, when the first well is expected to be tied into third-party processing facilities. The company also holds exploration licenses and leases in the Flemish Pass and Orphan basins offshore Atlantic Canada, the Mackenzie Delta region of the Northwest Territories and the Beaufort Sea region of Canadas Arctic, including a 35.4 percent nonoperated working interest in the offshore Amauligak discovery.

At the end of 2011, proved reserves had not been recognized for any of the Browse Basin fields. During 2011, the company announced a natural gas discovery at the 50 percent-owned and operated Orthrus Deep prospect in Block WA-24-R. The company also announced natural gas discoveries at the 50 percent-owned and operated Vos prospect in WA-439-P and the 67 percent-owned and operated Acme West prospect in Block WA-205-P in 2011, and at the 50 percent-owned and operated Satyr-3 prospect in WA-374-P in January 2012. These discoveries are expected to support potential expansion opportunities at company-operated LNG facilities. ##TABLE_START f) Europe ##TABLE_END In Europe, the company is engaged in exploration and production activities in Bulgaria, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania and the United Kingdom. Net oil-equivalent production in Europe averaged 139,000 barrels per day during 2011. ##TABLE_START      Denmark: Chevron has a 15 percent working interest in the partner-operated Danish Underground Consortium (DUC), which produces crude oil and natural gas from 13 fields in the Danish North Sea. Net oil-equivalent production in 2011 from DUC averaged 44,000 barrels per day, composed of 29,000 barrels of crude oil and 91 million cubic feet of natural gas. Netherlands: Chevron operates and holds interests ranging from 34.1 percent to 80 percent in 10 blocks in the Dutch sector of the North Sea. In 2011, the companys net oil-equivalent production from the producing blocks was 7,000 barrels per day, composed of 2,000 barrels of crude oil and 31 million cubic feet of natural gas. In fourth quarter 2011, the second stage of the A/B Gas Project achieved first gas. Norway: The company holds a 7.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the Draugen Field. The companys net production averaged 3,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day during 2011. Chevron is the operator and has a 40 percent working interest in exploration license PL 527. In 2011, Chevron was awarded a 40 percent-owned and operated interest in exploration license PL 598. Both licenses are in the deepwater portion of the Norwegian Sea. United Kingdom: The companys average net oil-equivalent production in 2011 from 10 offshore fields was 85,000 barrels per day, composed of 59,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 155 million cubic feet of natural gas. Most of the production was from the 85 percent-owned and operated Captain Field, the 23.4 percent-owned ##TABLE_END and operated Alba Field, and the 32.4 percent-owned and jointly operated Britannia Field. The final investment decision was reached in fourth quarter 2011 for the Clair Ridge Project, located west of the Shetland Islands, in which the company has a 19.4 percent nonoperated working interest. Total design capacity is planned to be 120,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and total estimated projects costs are $7 billion. Production is scheduled to begin in 2016. Initial proved reserves were recognized for this phase of the project in 2011. At the 70 percent-owned and operated Alder discovery, FEED activities progressed during 2011 and a final investment decision is planned for late 2012. In the 40 percent-owned and operated Rosebank area northwest of the Shetland Islands, seismic, geophysical, geotechnical and environmental surveys were completed during 2011, and FEED is expected to begin in the second-half 2012. At the end of 2011, proved reserves have not been recognized for these projects. Also west of the Shetland Islands, a three-well exploration and appraisal drilling program continued through 2011 and was completed in early 2012. This program comprised exploration wells on the Lagavulin and Aberlour prospects and appraisal drilling and well testing of the Cambo discovery. The Lagavulin well was unsuccessful and the results from the other wells are under evaluation. Licenses P1196 (Lagavulin) and P1165 (Talisker) were relinquished in November 2011 at the termination of the license period. In addition, the company entered into a master regasification agreement for access to available capacity at the South Hook LNG terminal in southwest Wales in 2011. ##TABLE_START      Bulgaria: In June 2011, the Bulgarian government advised that Chevron had submitted a winning tender for a permit for exploration in a 1.1 million-acre area in northeast Bulgaria. In January 2012, prior to execution of the license agreement, the Bulgarian government announced the withdrawal of the decision awarding the permit and the Bulgarian parliament imposed a ban on hydraulic fracturing, a technology commonly used for shale exploration and production. Chevron is continuing to work closely with the government of Bulgaria to provide the necessary assurances to the government and the public that hydrocarbons from shale can be developed safely and responsibly. Poland: Chevron holds four shale concessions in southeast Poland (Grabowiec, Zwierzyniec, Krasnik and Frampol). All four exploration licenses are 100 percent-owned and operated and comprise a total of 1.1 million acres. In 2011, Chevron focused on processing data from a 2-D seismic survey. The data is being used to plan a multiwell drilling program that commenced in fourth quarter 2011. ##TABLE_END Romania: The company holds a 100 percent interest in the EV-2 Barlad shale concession. This license, located in northeast Romania, covers 1.6 million acres. In 2011, the company acquired 2-D seismic data across the EV-2 Barlad concession. A multiwell drilling program is expected to begin in late 2012. Also during 2011, the company continued negotiations on license agreements for three shale exploration blocks in southeast Romania, Blocks 17, 18 and 19, which comprise approximately 670,000 acres. Sales of Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids The company sells natural gas and natural gas liquids from its producing operations under a variety of contractual arrangements. In addition, the company also makes third-party purchases and sales of natural gas and natural gas liquids in connection with its trading activities. During 2011, U.S. and international sales of natural gas were 5.8 billion and 4.4 billion cubic feet per day, respectively, which includes the companys share of equity affiliates sales. Outside the United States, substantially all of the natural gas sales from the companys producing interests are from operations in Australia, Bangladesh, Europe, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Latin America, the Philippines and Thailand. U.S. and international sales of natural gas liquids were 161 thousand and 87 thousand barrels per day, respectively, in 2011. Substantially all of the international sales of natural gas liquids are from company operations in Africa, Kazakhstan, Indonesia and the United Kingdom.

A consortium of South African partners owns preferred shares ultimately convertible to a 25 percent equity interest in Chevron South Africa (Pty) Limited. None of the preferred shares had been converted as of February 2012. 4 Includes 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000 barrels per day of refinery inputs in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for interests in refineries that were sold during those periods. ##TABLE_END Average crude oil distillation capacity utilization during 2011 was 89 percent, compared with 92 percent in 2010. At the U.S. fuel refineries, crude oil distillation capacity utilization averaged 89 percent in 2011, compared with 95 percent in 2010. Chevron processes both imported and domestic crude oil in its U.S. refining operations. Imported crude oil accounted for about 85 percent and 84 percent of Chevrons U.S. refinery inputs in 2011 and 2010, respectively. At the Pascagoula Refinery, construction progressed on a facility to produce approximately 25,000 barrels per day of premium base oil for use in manufacturing high-performance finished lubricants, such as motor oils for consumer and commercial applications. Project completion is expected by year-end 2013. In February 2012, the company signed an agreement to sell its idled 80,000-barrel-per-day refinery, which is operating as a terminal, at Perth Amboy. The sale is expected to close in second quarter 2012. At the refinery in El Segundo, construction progressed on a new processing unit designed to further improve the facilitys overall reliability, enhance high-value product yield and provide additional flexibility to process a broad range of crude slates. Project completion is expected in third quarter 2012. At the Richmond Refinery, the company filed an application for a conditional use permit for a revised project and the City of Richmond published its Notice of Preparation of the revised Environmental Impact Report in second quarter 2011. The project is designed to improve the refinerys ability to process higher sulfur crudes, without changing the refinerys capacity to process crude blends in the intermediate-light gravity range. Improved ability to process higher sulfur crudes is expected to provide increased flexibility to process lower API-gravity crudes within the refinerys existing capacity range. Refer also to a discussion of contingencies related to this project in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page FS-57. Outside the United States, GS Caltex, the companys 50 percent-owned affiliate, progressed the construction of a 53,000-barrel-per-day gas oil fluid catalytic cracking unit at the Yeosu Refinery in South Korea. The unit is scheduled for start-up in 2013. The unit is designed to increase high-value product yield and lower feedstock costs. Construction continued on modifications to the 64 percent-owned Star Petroleum Refinery in Thailand to meet regional specifications for cleaner fuels. Project completion is scheduled for 2012. During August 2011, the company completed the sale of the Pembroke Refinery in the United Kingdom. Also in 2011, Caltex Australia Ltd., the companys 50 percent-owned affiliate, initiated a review of its refining operations in Australia, which is ongoing. Marketing Operations The company markets petroleum products under the principal brands of Chevron, Texaco and Caltex throughout many parts of the world.

The company retired one U.S.-flagged product tanker in 2011. The foreign-flagged vessels are engaged primarily in transporting crude oil from the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Black Sea, South America, Mexico and West Africa to ports in the United States, Europe, Australia and Asia. The companys foreign-flagged vessels also transport refined products to and from various locations worldwide. In addition to the vessels described above, the company has contracts in place to build LNG carriers and a dynamic-positioning shuttle tanker to support future upstream projects. The company also owns a one-sixth interest in each of seven LNG carriers transporting cargoes for the North West Shelf Venture in Australia. Other Businesses Mining Chevrons U.S.-based mining company continues its efforts to divest its remaining coal mining operations. The company completed the sale of the North River Mine and other coal-related assets in Alabama in second quarter 2011, and the sale of its Kemmerer, Wyoming, surface coal mine in first quarter 2012. The company is pursuing the sale of its 50 percent interest in Youngs Creek Mining Company, LLC, which was formed to develop a coal mine in northern Wyoming. Activities related to final reclamation continued in 2011 at the company-operated surface coal mine in McKinley, New Mexico, which ceased coal production at the end of 2009. At year-end 2011, Chevron had 153 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in the United States, including reserves of low-sulfur coal. Coal sales from wholly owned mines in 2011 were 6 million tons, down about 2 million tons from 2010. In addition to the coal operations, Chevron owns and operates the Questa molybdenum mine in New Mexico. At year-end 2011, Chevron had 53 million pounds of proven molybdenum reserves at Questa. Production and underground development at Questa continued at reduced levels in 2011 in response to weak prices for molybdenum. Power Generation Chevrons Global Power Company manages interests in 13 power assets with a total operating capacity of more than 3,100 megawatts, primarily through joint ventures in the United States and Asia. Twelve of these are efficient combined-cycle and gas-fired cogeneration facilities that utilize recovered waste heat to produce electricity and support industrial thermal hosts. The 13th facility is a wind farm, located in Casper, Wyoming, that is designed to optimize the use of a decommissioned refinery site for delivery of clean, renewable energy to the local utility. The company has major geothermal operations in Indonesia and the Philippines and is investigating several advanced solar technologies for use in oil field operations as part of its renewable energy strategy. For additional information on the companys geothermal operations and renewable energy projects, refer to pages 19 and 20 and Research and Technology below. Chevron Energy Solutions (CES) CES is a wholly owned subsidiary that develops and builds sustainable energy projects that increase energy efficiency and production of renewable power, reduce energy costs, and ensure reliable, high-quality energy for government, education and business facilities. Since 2000, CES has developed hundreds of projects that have helped customers reduce their energy costs and environmental impact. Projects announced in 2011 include the City of Dinuba solar project in California; the Houston Independent School District renewable and energy efficiency project in Texas; the Eglin Air Force Base energy management systems upgrade project in Florida; and the Oceanic Time Warner solar project in Hawaii. Research and Technology The companys energy technology organization supports Chevrons upstream and downstream businesses by providing technology, services and competency development in earth sciences; reservoir and production engineering; drilling and completions; facilities engineering; manufacturing; process technology; catalysis; technical computing; and health, environment and safety disciplines. The information technology organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data management, security and network technology to provide a standardized digital infrastructure and enable Chevrons global operations and business processes. Chevron Technology Ventures (CTV) manages investments and projects in emerging energy technologies and their integration into Chevrons core businesses. As of the end of 2011, CTV continued to explore technologies such as next-generation biofuels and advanced solar. In 2011, the company completed construction and commissioned the worlds largest solar-to-steam generation project for use in enhanced-oil-recovery operations in Coalinga, California. The project will test the viability of using solar power to produce steam to improve oil recovery. Chevrons research and development expenses were $627 million, $526 million and $603 million for the years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain. Environmental Protection The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and minimize the impact of those that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address all credible and significant risks identified by site-specific risk and impact assessments. Chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs, Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation. To complement the companys capabilities, Chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives, including the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill Response, Ltd. (OSRL), which operates globally. The company is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the company is a member of the Subsea Well Response Project (SWRP). SWRPs objective is to further develop the industrys capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world. In late 2011, upon detection of ocean floor oil seeps in the deepwater Frade Field in Brazil, Chevron rapidly deployed capabilities and processes in coordination with OSRL. In early 2012, the company rapidly deployed response capabilities to address a natural gas well control incident in Nigeria. Virtually all aspects of the companys businesses are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to similar laws and regulations in other countries. These regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. Most of the costs of complying with the many laws and regulations pertaining to the companys operations are, or are expected to become, embedded in the normal costs of conducting business. In 2011, the companys U.S. capitalized environmental expenditures were $345 million, representing about 3 percent of the companys total consolidated U.S. capital and exploratory expenditures. These environmental expenditures include capital outlays to retrofit existing facilities as well as those associated with new facilities. The expenditures relate mostly to air- and water-quality projects and activities at the companys refineries, oil and gas producing facilities, and marketing facilities. For 2012, the company estimates U.S. capital expenditures for environmental control facilities will be approximately $410 million. The future annual capital costs are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements. Regulations intended to protect the environment, including those intended to address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change, continue to evolve. Legislation, regulations and market-based programs that could affect the companys operations exist at the international or multinational (such as the Kyoto Protocol and the European Unions Emissions Trading System), national (such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys rules for stricter emission standards and increased renewable fuel content for transportation fuels), and regional (such as Californias Global Warming Solutions Act) levels. Refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on pages FS-14 through FS-16 for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron and on the companys 2011 environmental expenditures, remediation provisions and year-end environmental reserves. Refer also to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 29 through 31 for a discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change.

The reports are also available on the SECs Web site at www.sec.gov . ##TABLE_START ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors ##TABLE_END Chevron is a global energy company with a diversified business portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a history of generating sufficient cash to pay dividends and fund capital and exploratory expenditures. Nevertheless, some inherent risks could materially impact the companys financial results of operations or financial condition. Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices. Chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices and geopolitical risk. Chevron accepts the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process. As such, an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices. During extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil, the companys upstream earnings and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected. Upstream assets may also become impaired. The impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. The scope of Chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources. The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if Chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions, the companys business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors. Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The companys operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes beyond its control, including hurricanes, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, civil unrest and other political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. The companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight. Chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. Nonetheless, in certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. Chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action. The company produces, transports, refines and markets materials with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business. Chevron operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions on the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure. The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to cover fully all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition. Political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm Chevrons business. The companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have imposed or proposed restrictions on the companys operations, export and exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. At December 31, 2011, 22 percent of the companys net proved reserves were located in Kazakhstan. The company also has significant interests in OPEC-member countries, including Angola, Nigeria and Venezuela and in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Twenty-two percent of the companys net proved reserves, including affiliates, were located in OPEC countries at December 31, 2011. Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase Chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for Chevrons products. Continued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it, and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the companys operations and financial results. International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, the companys activities in it and market conditions. Greenhouse gas emissions that could be regulated include those arising from the companys exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys products. Some of these activities, such as consumers and customers use of the companys products, as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the companys control. The effect of regulation on the companys financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the companys ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products. Material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products the company currently sells and adversely affect the companys sales volumes, revenues and margins. Changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operations performance in any given period. In preparing the companys periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and impairments to property, plant and equipment. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the companys business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_END Ecuador Information related to Ecuador matters is included in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading Ecuador, beginning on page FS-41. Certain Governmental Proceedings In November 2008, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) proposed a civil penalty against Chevrons Sacramento, California, terminal for alleged violations between August and December 2007 of CARBs regulations governing the minimum concentration of additives in gasoline. Due to a computer programming error, the Sacramento terminals automatic dispensers allegedly failed to inject additive detergent into a gasoline line. It appears that the resolution of these notices of violation may result in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000. In November 2008, CARB proposed a civil penalty against Chevrons Richmond, California, refinery for a notice of violation relating to gasoline that was not properly certified as to composition. The composition certificates for the gasoline were corrected without requiring any change to the composition of the gasoline. In July 2009, CARB issued the refinery a notice of violation relating to an error in gasoline blending that caused the product composition certifications to be in error. The composition certifications were corrected without requiring any change to the gasoline. Discussions with CARB officials relating to all of these matters continue. It appears that the resolution of these notices of violation may result in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000. In July 2009, CARB issued a notice of violation against Chevron Products Company for alleged violations of CARBs regulations governing the certification of gasoline that occurred during storage at a third-party facility and which had been self-reported by Chevron on discovery. Chevron believes that this matter will not result in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000. In 2011, CARB made penalty demands with respect to four notices of violation against Chevron for alleged violations of CARBs fuel blend regulations at certain California terminals and refineries. It appears that the resolution of these notices of violation may result in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000. In July 2009, the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) alleged that Chevron is obligated to pay stipulated civil penalties exceeding $100,000 in conjunction with commitments Chevron undertook to install and operate certain air emission control equipment at its Hawaii Refinery pursuant to a Clean Air Act settlement with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and DOH. Chevron has disputed many of the allegations. Chevron has entered into negotiations with the EPA with respect to alleged air quality violations at Chevrons Perth Amboy, New Jersey refinery identified in a September 16, 2008 Compliance Order issued by the EPA. The alleged violations relate to certain management and reporting requirements set forth in the EPAs Leak Detection and Repair regulations (these regulations pertain to the control and monitoring of fugitive emissions from refinery process equipment). Based on discussions with the EPA, it appears that the resolution of this matter may result in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000. The EPA indicated that it would assess Chevrons Salt Lake City Refinery a civil penalty for alleged violations of federal requirements and Utahs air pollution laws. These alleged violations were the subject of an August 20, 2008 EPA Notice of Violation (NOV) for which no penalty was assessed at the time. It appears that the resolution of this NOV may result in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) issued a NOV to Chevrons Huntington Beach, California, terminal seeking a civil penalty for alleged violations involving the repair of two holes in the roof of a tank at the terminal. Based on a July 8, 2011, settlement communication with the SCAQMD, it appears that the resolution of this NOV may result in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000. Chevron reached a final resolution of an administrative penalty proceeding brought by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality by agreeing to pay the State of Utah a civil penalty of $500,000 as the result of two crude oil releases. The first release occurred in June 2010 and the second occurred in December 2010. In addition, Chevron agreed to pay the State of Utah and the Salt Lake City Corporation $4 million in damages and restoration projects. The public review period passed and the penalty has been paid. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " Item 4.

Business General Development of Business  Summary Description of Chevron  Chevron Corporation, * a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations, mining activities, power generation and energy services. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids project. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives.  A list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on pages E-4 and E-5. As of December 31, 2012 , Chevron had approximately 62,000 employees (including about 3,700 service station employees). Approximately 31,000 employees (including about 3,400 service station employees), or 50 percent, were employed in U.S. operations.  Overview of Petroleum Industry   Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. The members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are typically the worlds swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly.   Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets.  Operating Environment   Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-8 of this Form 10-K in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the companys current business environment and outlook. Chevrons Strategic Direction   Chevrons primary objective is to create shareholder value and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream, the companys strategies are to grow profitably in core areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the companys equity natural gas resource base while growing a high-impact global natural gas business. In the downstream, the strategies are to improve returns and grow earnings across the value chain. The company also continues to utilize technology across all its businesses to differentiate performance, and to invest in profitable renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. ___________________________________   ##TABLE_START * Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term Chevron and such terms as the company, the corporation, our, we and us may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include affiliates of Chevron  i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. ##TABLE_END Description of Business and Properties The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects* in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2012 , and assets as of the end of 2012 and 2011  for the United States and the companys international geographic areas  are in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page FS-36. Similar comparative data for the companys investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Notes 11 and 12 on pages FS-38 through FS-40.  Capital and Exploratory Expenditures   Total expenditures for 2012 were $34.2 billion , including $2.1 billion for the companys share of equity-affiliate expenditures. In 2011 and 2010 , expenditures were $29.1 billion and $21.8 billion , respectively, including the companys share of affiliates expenditures of $1.7 billion in 2011 and $1.4 billion in 2010 .   Of the $34.2 billion in expenditures for 2012 , 89 percent , or $30.4 billion , was related to upstream activities. Approximately 89 and 87 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2011 and 2010 , respectively. International upstream accounted for about 72 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2012 , about 68 percent in 2011 and about 82 percent in 2010 . These amounts exclude the acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc., in 2011.   In 2013 , the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be $36.7 billion, including $3.3 billion of spending by affiliates. Approximately 90 percent of the total, or $33 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities, with $25.5 billion, or about 70 percent, of this amount for projects outside the United States.   Refer also to a discussion of the companys capital and exploratory expenditures on page FS-12.  Upstream   The table on the following page summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2012 and 2011 by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production was 2.610 million barrels per day, down about 2 percent from 2011 . The decrease was mainly associated with normal field declines, the shut-in of the Frade Field in Brazil, and a major planned turnaround at the Tengizchevroil facilities in Kazakhstan. The start-up and ramp-up of several major capital projects  the Platong II natural gas project in Thailand, the Usan and Agbami 2 projects in Nigeria, and the Perdido, Tahiti 2 and Caesar/Tonga projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico  partially offset the decrease in net production from 2011. Refer to the Results of Operations section beginning on page FS-6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2010 through 2012 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and natural gas.   The company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent production in 2013 will be approximately 2.650 million barrels per day based on an average Brent price of $112 per barrel in 2012 . This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, price effects on entitlement volumes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project start-ups and ramp-ups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds, greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions to operations. The longer-term outlook for production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production.

Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below.  In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver to third parties 192 billion cubic feet of natural gas through 2015 . The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the companys proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments include a variety of pricing terms, including both indexed and fixed-price contracts.   Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 791 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2013 through 2015 for operations in Australia, Colombia, Denmark and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the companys proved developed reserves in these countries.

An expansion project to develop a fourth train at the Gorgon LNG facility is expected to enter FEED in late 2013. At the end of 2012, proved reserves had not been recognized for the fields associated with this project.  Chevron is the operator of the Wheatstone Project, which includes a two-train, 8.9 million-metric-ton-per-year LNG facility and a domestic gas plant located at Ashburton North, along the northwest coast of Australia. The company plans to supply natural gas to the facilities from three company-operated licenses, containing the Wheatstone Field and nearby Iago Field. Maximum total daily production from these and third-party fields is expected to be about 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 30,000 barrels of condensate. Start-up of the first train is expected in 2016. Total estimated project costs for the first phase of development are $29 billion. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. The project's estimated economic life exceeds 30 years from the time of start-up.  In 2012, construction and fabrication activities progressed, with a focus on delivering site infrastructure and key components of the platform and subsea equipment. Chevron signed additional commercial agreements that decreased Chevron's interest in the offshore licenses to 80.2 percent and in the LNG facilities to 64.1 percent. The company also executed agreements with Asian customers for the delivery of additional volumes of LNG. As of year-end 2012, more than 80 percent of Chevrons equity LNG offtake was covered under long-term agreements with customers in Asia. In addition, the company has begun marketing its equity share of natural gas of approximately 120 million cubic feet per day to Western Australia natural gas consumers.  During 2012 and early 2013, the company announced seven natural gas discoveries in the Carnarvon Basin. These include natural gas discoveries at the 47.3 percent-owned and operated Pontus prospect in Block WA-37-L, the 50 percent-owned and operated Satyr prospect in Block WA-374-P, the 50 percent-owned and operated Pinhoe prospect in Block WA-383-P, the 50 percent-owned and operated Arnhem prospect in Block WA-364-P, and the 50 percent-owned and operated Kentish Knock South prospect in Block WA-365-P. These discoveries are expected to contribute to potential expansion opportunities at company-operated LNG facilities.  Chevron has a 16.7 percent nonoperated working interest in the North West Shelf (NWS) Venture in Western Australia. Daily net production from the project during 2012 averaged 20,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate, 428 million cubic feet of natural gas, and 4,000 barrels of LPG. Approximately 70 percent of the natural gas was sold in the form of LNG to major utilities in Asia, primarily under long-term contracts. The remaining natural gas was sold to the Western Australia domestic market. The concession for the NWS Venture expires in 2034.  The North Rankin 2 project continued to advance during 2012, with start-up expected in mid-2013. The project is designed to recover remaining low-pressure natural gas from the North Rankin and Perseus fields to meet gas supply needs and maintain NWS production capacity of about 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 39,000 barrels of condensate. Total estimated projects costs are $5.4 billion. Proved reserves have been recognized for the project. The project's estimated economic life exceeds 20 years from the time of start-up.  In October 2012, the company exchanged its 16.7 percent interest in the East Browse leases and its 20 percent interest in the West Browse leases for financial consideration and a 33.3 percent interest in the WA-205-P and WA-42-R blocks in the Carnarvon Basin and now holds a 100 percent interest in these blocks, which contain the Clio and Acme fields. The company retains other nonoperated working interests ranging from 24.8 percent to 50 percent in three other blocks in the Browse Basin. In Block WA-274-P, drilling in the fourth quarter 2012 resulted in a natural gas discovery at the Crown prospect. Europe In Europe, the company is engaged in upstream activities in Bulgaria, Denmark, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. Net oil-equivalent production in Europe averaged 114,000 barrels per day during 2012. ##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDDenmark: Chevron has a 12 percent working interest in the partner-operated Danish Underground Consortium (DUC), which produces crude oil and natural gas from 13 fields in the Danish North Sea. Net oil-equivalent production in 2012 from DUC averaged 36,000 barrels per day, composed of 24,000 barrels of crude oil and 74 million cubic feet of natural gas. In July 2012, as part of a 30-year concession extension, the state-owned Danish North Sea Fund received a 20 percent ownership of the DUC in exchange for the previous 20 percent government profit-take arrangements and the company's interest was reduced from 15 percent to 12 percent. The concession expires in 2042. Netherlands: Chevron operates and holds interests ranging from 34.1 percent to 80 percent in 10 blocks in the Dutch sector of the North Sea.

In 2012 , the company continued evaluation of a solar-to-steam generation project in use to support enhanced-oil-recovery operations in Coalinga, California. This project was commissioned to test the viability of using solar power to produce steam to improve oil recovery.  In 2012, the company launched a new tank technology for storing water at hydraulic fracturing operations. These patent-pending modular metal tanks can be quickly assembled and taken apart for reuse at other wells. This enables drilling and fracturing without the need for water storage pits and is intended to result in enhanced safety, less land disturbance, smaller drill site pads and significantly lower costs. The first fully operational tank was brought into service in Ohio.  Chevrons research and development expenses were $648 million, $627 million and $526 million for the years 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.  Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain.  Environmental Protection:  The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and minimize the impact of those that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address all credible and significant risks identified by site-specific risk and impact assessments. Chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs, Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation.  To complement the companys capabilities, Chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives, including the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill Response, Ltd. (OSRL), which operates globally. The company is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico.

The reports are also available on the SECs Web site at www.sec.gov . ##TABLE_START ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors ##TABLE_END Chevron is a global energy company with a diversified business portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a history of generating sufficient cash to pay dividends and fund capital and exploratory expenditures. Nevertheless, some inherent risks could materially impact the companys financial results of operations or financial condition. Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices:  Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risk. Chevron accepts the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process. As such, an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices.  During extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil, the companys upstream earnings and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected. Upstream assets may also become impaired. The impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. The scope of Chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources:  The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if Chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions, the companys business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors: Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The companys operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes beyond its control, including hurricanes, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, civil unrest and other political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. The companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight: Chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. Nonetheless, in certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. Chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action: The company produces, transports, refines and markets materials with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.  For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, including information relating to Ecuador matters, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on FS-40. The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure: The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition. Political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm Chevrons business: The companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties.  In certain locations, governments have imposed or proposed restrictions on the companys operations, export and exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. At December 31, 2012 , 21 percent of the companys net proved reserves were located in Kazakhstan. The company also has significant interests in OPEC-member countries, including Angola, Nigeria and Venezuela and in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Twenty-one percent of the companys net proved reserves, including affiliates, were located in OPEC countries at December 31, 2012 . Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase Chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for Chevrons products:  Continued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it, and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the companys operations and financial results.  International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, the companys activities in it and market conditions. Greenhouse gas emissions that could be regulated include those arising from the companys exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys products. Some of these activities, such as consumers and customers use of the companys products, as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the companys control.  The effect of regulation on the companys financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the companys ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products. Material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products the company currently sells and adversely affect the companys sales volumes, revenues and margins. Changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period:  In preparing the companys periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and impairments to property, plant and equipment. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the companys business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item1B.

Legal Proceedings  Ecuador:  Information related to Ecuador matters is included in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading Ecuador, beginning on page FS-40.  Certain Governmental Proceedings:   I n 2011, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) made penalty demands with respect to four notices of violation against Chevron for alleged violations of CARB's fuel blend regulations at certain California terminals and refineries. In November 2011, the statute of limitations expired with respect to two of the notices of violation. On January 28, 2013, settlements were executed, which resolved the remaining two notices of violation. One settlement, with respect to the Richmond Refinery, resulted in the payment of a civil penalty in the amount of $192,500, and the other settlement, relating to the San Jose and Sacramento terminals, resulted in the payment of a civil penalty in the amount of $205,000.  In July 2009, the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) alleged that Chevron is obligated to pay stipulated civil penalties exceeding $100,000 in conjunction with commitments Chevron undertook to install and operate certain air emission control equipment at its Hawaii Refinery pursuant to a Clean Air Act settlement with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the DOH. Chevron has disputed many of the allegations. The EPA indicated that it would assess Chevron's Salt Lake City Refinery a civil penalty for alleged violations of federal requirements and Utah's air quality laws. These alleged violations were the subject of an August 20, 2008, EPA Notice of Violation (NOV) for which no penalty was assessed at the time. It appears that the resolution of this NOV may result in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000.  The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) issued an NOV to Chevron's Huntington Beach, California, terminal seeking a civil penalty for alleged violations involving the repair of two holes in the roof of a tank at the terminal. On January 24, 2013, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. executed a settlement agreement with the SCAQMD and made payment of $100,000 to resolve the NOV issued to the Huntington Beach terminal.  In September and November 2012, Chevron's Richmond Refinery received from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) proposals to resolve 47 alleged NOVs related to air quality regulations. A single settlement agreement has been finalized covering 28 of those NOVs for payment of $145,600 in civil penalties. Resolution of the remaining NOVs is pending and may result in a civil penalty exceeding $100,000.   In April 2012, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) issued a letter seeking to settle five separate and unrelated NOVs issued to Chevron's El Segundo Refinery in 2011 for alleged violations of various state and local rules relating to air emissions. On January 24, 2013, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. executed a settlement agreement with SCAQMD and made payment of $300,000 to resolve the five NOVs issued to the El Segundo Refinery. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " Item 4.

Business General Development of Business  Summary Description of Chevron  Chevron Corporation, * a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations, mining operations, and power and energy services. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids project. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives.  A list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on page E-4. As of December 31, 2013 , Chevron had approximately 64,600 employees (including about 3,200 service station employees). Approximately 32,000 employees (including about 3,000 service station employees), or 50 percent, were employed in U.S. operations.  Overview of Petroleum Industry   Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. The members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are typically the worlds swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly.   Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets.  Operating Environment   Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-8 of this Form 10-K in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the companys current business environment and outlook. Chevrons Strategic Direction   Chevrons primary objective is to create shareholder value and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream, the companys strategies are to grow profitably in core areas and build new legacy positions. In the downstream, the strategies are to deliver competitive returns and grow earnings across the value chain. The company also continues to apply commercial excellence to enable the success of the upstream and downstream strategies, to utilize technology across all its businesses to differentiate performance, and to invest in profitable renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. ___________________________________   ##TABLE_START * Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term Chevron and such terms as the company, the corporation, our, we and us may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include affiliates of Chevron  i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. ##TABLE_END Description of Business and Properties The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects* in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2013 , and assets as of the end of 2013 and 2012  for the United States and the companys international geographic areas  are in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page FS-35. Similar comparative data for the companys investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Notes 12 and 13 on pages FS-37 through FS-39.  Capital and Exploratory Expenditures   Total expenditures for 2013 were $41.9 billion , including $2.7 billion for the companys share of equity-affiliate expenditures. In 2012 and 2011 , expenditures were $34.2 billion and $29.1 billion , respectively, including the companys share of affiliates expenditures of $2.1 billion in 2012 and $1.7 billion in 2011 .   Of the $41.9 billion in expenditures for 2013 , 90 percent , or $37.9 billion , was related to upstream activities. Approximately 89 percent was expended for upstream operations in both 2012 and 2011 . International upstream accounted for about 78 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2013 , about 72 percent in 2012 and about 68 percent in 2011 . These amounts exclude the acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc. in 2011.   In 2014 , the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be $39.8 billion, including $4.8 billion of spending by affiliates. Approximately 90 percent of the total, or $35.8 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities, with $27.9 billion, or about 78 percent, of this amount for projects outside the United States.   Refer also to a discussion of the companys capital and exploratory expenditures on page FS- 12.  Upstream   The table on the following page summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2013 and 2012 by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production of 2.597 million barrels per day in 2013 was essentially unchanged from 2012 . The benefits of lower maintenance-related downtime and higher reliability at the Tengizchevroil facilities in Kazakhstan, and ramp-ups at the Usan Project in Nigeria, in the Marcellus Shale in western Pennsylvania and in the Delaware Basin in New Mexico were offset by normal field declines. Refer to the Results of Operations section beginning on page FS-6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2011 through 2013 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and natural gas.   The company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent production in 2014 will be approximately 2.610 million barrels per day based on an average Brent price of $109 per barrel in 2013 . This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, price effects on entitlement volumes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project start-ups and ramp-ups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds, greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions to operations. The longer-term outlook for production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. Refer to the Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas, beginning on page 9, for a discussion of the companys major crude oil and natural gas development projects. ___________________________________ ##TABLE_START * As used in this report, the term project may describe new upstream development activity, individual phases in a multiphase development, maintenance activities, certain existing assets, new investments in downstream and chemicals capacity, investments in emerging and sustainable energy activities, and certain other activities.

Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below.  In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver to third parties 285 billion cubic feet of natural gas through 2016 . The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the companys proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments include a variety of pricing terms, including both indexed and fixed-price contracts.   Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 871 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2014 through 2016 from operations in Australia, Colombia, Denmark, the Netherlands and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the companys proved developed reserves in these countries.

Perforation of all eight development wells in the Gorgon Field and completion of the Jansz-Io drilling program are expected in late 2014.  Chevron has signed binding, long-term LNG Sales and Purchase Agreements with six Asian customers for delivery of about 4.8 million metric tons of LNG per year, which brings delivery commitments to 65 percent of Chevrons share of LNG from this project. Discussions continue with potential customers to increase long-term sales to around 80 percent of Chevrons net LNG offtake. Chevron also has binding long-term agreements for delivery of about 65 million cubic feet per day of natural gas to Western Australian natural gas consumers starting in 2015, and the company continues to market additional natural gas quantities from the Gorgon Project. The evaluation of expansion options to increase the production capacity of Gorgon is planned to continue in 2014. Chevron is the operator of the Wheatstone Project, which includes a two-train, 8.9 million-metric-ton-per-year LNG facility and a domestic gas plant located at Ashburton North, on the coast of Western Australia. The company plans to supply natural gas to the facilities from three company-operated licenses containing the Wheatstone and Iago fields. Chevron holds a 64.1 percent interest in the LNG facilities and an 80.2 percent interest in the offshore licenses. Total production capacity for the Wheatstone and Iago fields and nearby third-party fields is expected to be approximately 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 30,000 barrels of condensate per day. Start-up of the first train is expected in 2016. Total estimated costs for the foundation phase are $29 billion. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. The project's estimated economic life exceeds 30 years from the time of start-up.  In 2013, construction and fabrication activities progressed, with a focus on delivering site infrastructure to enable efficient plant construction. Offshore dredging, pipeline installation and drilling of development wells commenced during the year. Fabrication also progressed on key upstream components, including the offshore platform and subsea equipment. Delivery of the first Train 1 LNG plant modules is expected in second-half 2014, along with the installation of the offshore platform steel gravity-based structure, completion of the natural gas export trunkline and completion of the LNG Tank 1 foundation. The project was approximately 25 percent complete at year-end. T he company also executed binding long-term Sales and Purchase Agreements with two Asian customers for the delivery of additional LNG. As of year-end 2013, 85 percent of Chevrons equity LNG offtake is committed under long-term agreements with customers in Asia. In addition, the company continues to market its equity share of natural gas to Western Australia consumers.  During 2013, the company announced two natural gas discoveries in the Carnarvon Basin. These include natural gas discoveries at the 50 percent-owned and operated Kentish Knock South prospect in Block WA-365-P and the 50 percent-owned and operated Elfin prospect in Block WA-268-P. These discoveries are expected to contribute to potential expansion opportunities at company-operated LNG projects.  Chevron has a 16.7 percent nonoperated working interest in the North West Shelf (NWS) Venture in Western Australia. Daily net production in 2013 averaged 19,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate, 419 million cubic feet of natural gas, and 3,000 barrels of LPG. Approximately 70 percent of the natural gas was sold in the form of LNG to major utilities in Asia, primarily under long-term contracts. The remaining natural gas was sold to the Western Australia domestic market. The concession for the NWS Venture expires in 2034. Production commenced at the North Rankin 2 Project in fourth quarter 2013. The project is designed to recover remaining low-pressure natural gas from the North Rankin and Perseus fields to meet gas supply needs and maintain NWS daily production of about 2 billi on cubic feet of natural gas and 39,000 barrels of condensate. The project's estimated economic life exceeds 20 years from the time of start-up. T he company holds nonoperated working interests ranging from 24.8 percent to 50 percent in three blocks in the Browse Basin.  In 2013, the company acquired nonoperated working interests in two onshore blocks covering 810,000 total acres in the Nappamerri Trough, located in the Cooper Basin region in central Australia. The acquisition includes a 30 percent interest in PEL 218 in South Australia and an 18 percent interest in ATP 855 in Queensland. Pending favorable results of an exploration drilling program, Chevron could earn nonoperated working interests of 60 percent in PEL 218 and 36 percent in ATP 855.  In October 2013, the company acquired exploration interests in offshore Blocks EPP44 and EPP45, which span more than 8 million acres in the Bight Basin off the South Australian coast.

The reports are also available on the SECs website at www.sec.gov . ##TABLE_START ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors ##TABLE_END Chevron is a global energy company with a diversified business portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a history of generating sufficient cash to pay dividends and fund capital and exploratory expenditures. Nevertheless, some inherent risks could materially impact the companys financial results of operations or financial condition. Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices:  Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risk. Chevron accepts the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process. As such, an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices.  During extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil, the companys upstream earnings and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected. Upstream assets may also become impaired. The impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. The scope of Chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources:  The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if Chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions, the companys business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors: Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The companys operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes beyond its control, including hurricanes, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, civil unrest and other political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. The companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight: Chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. Chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action: The company produces, transports, refines and markets materials with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.  For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, including information relating to Ecuador matters, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-39. The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure: The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition. Political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm Chevrons business: The companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties.  In certain locations, governments have imposed or proposed restrictions on the companys operations, export and exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. At December 31, 2013 , 21 percent of the companys net proved reserves were located in Kazakhstan. The company also has significant interests in OPEC-member countries, including Angola, Nigeria and Venezuela, and in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Twenty-one percent of the companys net proved reserves, including affiliates, were located in OPEC countries at December 31, 2013 . Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase Chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for Chevrons products:  Continued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it, and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the companys operations and financial results.  International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, the companys activities in it and market conditions. Greenhouse gas emissions that could be regulated include those arising from the companys exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys products. Some of these activities, such as consumers and customers use of the companys products, as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the companys control.  The effect of regulation on the companys financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the companys ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products. Material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products the company currently sells and adversely affect the companys sales volumes, revenues and margins. Changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period:  In preparing the companys periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and impairments to property, plant and equipment. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the companys business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item1B.

Legal Proceedings  Ecuador:  Information related to Ecuador matters is included in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading Ecuador, beginning on page FS-39.  Certain Governmental Proceedings:   As initially disclosed in the first quarter 2011 Form 10-Q, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) indicated that it would assess the company's Salt Lake City Refinery a civil penalty for alleged violations of federal requirements and Utah's air quality laws. These alleged violations were the subject of an August 20, 2008, EPA Notice of Violation (NOV) for which no penalty was assessed at the time. On October 21, 2013, the U.S. District Court in Utah entered a Consent Decree resolving the NOV. Pursuant to the Consent Decree, Chevron paid a penalty of $384,000 and agreed to implement certain other measures.  On August 6, 2012, a piping failure and fire occurred at the Chevron U.S.A. Inc. refinery in Richmond, California. Various federal, state, and local agencies initiated investigations as a result of the incident. Based on its civil investigation, the United States EPA issued a Finding of Violations (FOV) to Chevron on December 17, 2013, which includes 62 findings of alleged noncompliance at the refinery. The majority of these findings relate to the August 2012 fire and alleged violations of chemical-accident-prevention laws, but the FOV also addresses a number of release-reporting issues, some of which are unrelated to the fire. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more.  In July 2009, the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) alleged that Chevron is obligated to pay stipulated civil penalties in conjunction with commitments Chevron undertook to install and operate certain air emission control equipment at its Hawaii Refinery pursuant to a Clean Air Act settlement with the United States EPA and the DOH. The company has disputed many of the allegations. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more.  As initially disclosed in the 2012 Form 10-K, in September and November 2012, Chevron's Richmond Refinery received from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) proposals to resolve 47 alleged NOVs related to air quality regulations. In December 2012, a settlement agreement was finalized covering 28 of those NOVs for payment of $145,600 in civil penalties. The company reached a settlement agreement with BAAQMD and paid $190,000 in civil penalties to resolve 17 of the remaining NOVs, and the BAAQMD has informed the company that it will not seek penalties for the last two remaining NOVs.  On June 10, 2013, the company received correspondence from the California Air Resources Board regarding an alleged violation of California's Regulation for the Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions based on alleged delay in the reporting of emissions data for Chevron's San Joaquin Valley Business Unit. Chevron has reached an agreement-in-principle with the California Air Resources Board under which the company would pay a $328,500 civil penalty to resolve the alleged violations.  The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has alleged that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported by Chevrons El Segundo Refinery for the 2011 calendar year contained an error in violation of Californias GHG reporting regulation, and that the reporting error resulted in an over-allocation of GHG allowances. The company has reached an agreement-in- principle with the CARB under which Chevron would pay a $364,500 civil penalty to resolve the alleged violations.  As initially disclosed in the third quarter 2013 Form 10-Q, in July 2013, Chevron Products Company, a division of Chevron U.S.A. Inc., received a NOV from the CARB for the Richmond and Montebello (California) terminals alleging the selling or offering for sale of gasoline containing more than the maximum allowable ethanol content. Resolution of the alleged violation may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more.  On October 18, 2013, the CARB issued a Notice of Violation alleging that Chevrons San Diego terminal sold gasoline with less than the required detergent content for 34 months from 2010 to 2012. Resolution of the alleged violation may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more.  On December 18, 2013, EPA declared certain renewable fuel credits (also referred to as Renewable Identification Numbers or RINs) generated by E-Biofuel to be invalid. The company previously submitted RINs generated by E-Biofuel for 2012 compliance with federal renewable fuels requirements. Under current EPA policy, the company's earlier submittal of those now-invalid RINs generated by E-Biofuel may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more.  As previously disclosed in the third quarter 2013 Form 10-Q, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. has participated in settlement discussions and received a proposed settlement agreement from the South Coast Air Quality Management District to resolve alleged violations of the El Segundo Refinery's Clean Air Act Title V Operating Permit. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more.  The State of New Mexico provided to Chevron a NOV on December 11, 2013, alleging that the flaring of fuel gas that occurred during periodic compressor purging events at the Chevron Buckeye CO2 plant resulted in hourly air emissions during these events in excess of the plant permit limits and alleging that the company had failed to timely report these excess emissions. The resolution of this NOV may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more.  As initially disclosed in the second quarter 2013 Form 10-Q, Chevron Pipe Line Company (CPL) received a NOV from the Utah Division of Water Quality (DWQ) in April 2013 alleging state law violations resulting from a pipeline spill near Willard Bay State Park, Utah. CPL has concluded a settlement agreement with the DWQ and the Utah Department of Natural Resources, State Parks and Recreation Division to resolve these alleged violations, which includes a monetary penalty of $350,000 as well as $5 million for environmentally beneficial mitigation projects and for lost use damages. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " Item 4.

Business General Development of Business Summary Description of Chevron Chevron Corporation, * a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations, and power and energy services. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. A list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on page E-4. As of December 31, 2014 , Chevron had approximately 64,700 employees (including about 3,300 service station employees). Approximately 31,800 employees (including about 3,100 service station employees), or 49 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. Overview of Petroleum Industry Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets. Operating Environment Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-9 of this Form 10-K in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the companys current business environment and outlook. Chevrons Strategic Direction Chevrons primary objective is to create shareholder value and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream, the companys strategies are to grow profitably in core areas and build new legacy positions. In the downstream, the strategies are to deliver competitive returns and grow earnings across the value chain. The company also continues to apply commercial excellence in supply, trading and transportation to enable the success of the upstream and downstream strategies, and to utilize technology across all its businesses to differentiate performance. Information about the company is available on the companys website at www.chevron.com . Information contained on the companys website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The companys Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on the companys website soon after such reports are filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The reports are also available on the SECs website at www.sec.gov . ________________________________________________________ * Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term Chevron and such terms as the company, the corporation, our, we and us may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include affiliates of Chevron  i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. Description of Business and Properties The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects * in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2014 , and assets as of the end of 2014 and 2013  for the United States and the companys international geographic areas  are in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page FS-37. Similar comparative data for the companys investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Notes 13 and 14 on pages FS-40 through FS-41. Refer to page FS-13 of this Form 10-K in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company's capital and exploratory expenditures.  Upstream Reserves Refer to Table V beginning on page FS-65 for a tabulation of the companys proved net liquids (including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil) and natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2012 and each year-end from 2012 through 2014 . Reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ended December 31, 2014 , are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations. At December 31, 2014, 20 percent of the company's net proved reserves were located in Kazakhstan and 19 percent were located in the United States. The net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years 2012 through 2014 are shown in the following table: ##TABLE_START  At December 31       Liquids  Millions of barrels       Consolidated Companies 4,285  4,303  4,353  Affiliated Companies 1,964  2,042  2,128  Total Liquids 6,249  6,345  6,481  Natural Gas  Billions of cubic feet       Consolidated Companies 25,707  25,670  25,654  Affiliated Companies 3,409  3,476  3,541  Total Natural Gas 29,116  29,146  29,195  Oil-Equivalent  Millions of barrels *       Consolidated Companies 8,570  8,582  8,629  Affiliated Companies 2,532  2,621  2,718  Total Oil-Equivalent 11,102  11,203  11,347  ##TABLE_END* Oil-equivalent conversion ratio is 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas = 1 barrel of oil. ________________________________________________________ ##TABLE_START *  As used in this report, the term project may describe new upstream development activity, individual phases in a multiphase development, maintenance activities, certain existing assets, new investments in downstream and chemicals capacity, investments in emerging and sustainable energy activities, and certain other activities. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of the term project as it relates to any specific governmental law or regulation. ##TABLE_END 4 Net Production of Liquids and Natural Gas The following table summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2014 and 2013 by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production of 2.571 million barrels per day in 2014 was down 1 percent from 2013 . Production increases in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and the Marcellus Shale in western Pennsylvania, and project ramp-ups in Nigeria, Argentina and Brazil, were more than offset by normal field declines, production entitlement effects in several locations and the effect of asset sales.

Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver 239 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties through 2017 . The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the companys proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments include a variety of pricing terms, including both indexed and fixed-price contracts. Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 705 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2015 through 2017 from operations in Australia, Colombia, Denmark and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the companys proved developed reserves in these countries.

Poland: In first-half 2014, Chevron completed a 3-D seismic survey on the Grabowiec concession. The company also entered into a joint exploration agreement covering Chevron's Grabowiec and Zwierzyniec licenses and two adjacent licenses in early 2014. In fourth quarter 2014, Chevron relinquished two shale concessions (Frampol and Krasnik) in southeastern Poland. In early 2015, Chevron announced the discontinuation of exploration activities in Poland. Romania: In 2014, drilling of the first exploration well in the Barlad Shale concession in northeast Romania was completed, as was a 2-D seismic survey across two of the three concessions in southeast Romania. Chevron intends to pursue relinquishment of its interest in these concessions in 2015. Ukraine: In 2013, Chevron signed a PSC with the government of Ukraine for a 50 percent interest and operatorship of the Oleska Shale block in western Ukraine. In fourth quarter 2014, Chevron terminated the agreement. United Kingdom: The companys average net oil-equivalent production in 2014 from nine offshore fields was 47,000 barrels per day, composed of 32,000 barrels of liquids and 88 million cubic feet of natural gas. Most of the company's production was from three fields: the 85 percent-owned and operated Captain Field, the 23.4 percent-owned and operated Alba Field, and the 32.4 percent-owned and jointly operated Britannia Field. The 73.7 percent-owned and operated Alder Project is being developed as a tie-back to the existing Britannia platform, and has a design capacity of 14,000 barrels of condensate and 110 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Fabrication of topside and subsea equipment progressed in 2014, and first production is expected in 2016. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. The Captain Enhanced Oil Recovery Project is the next development phase of the Captain Field and is designed to increase field recovery. The project entered FEED in fourth quarter 2014, and a final investment decision is scheduled for 2016. At the end of 2014, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project. During 2014, procurement and fabrication activities continued for the Clair Ridge Project, located west of the Shetland Islands, in which the company has a 19.4 percent nonoperated working interest. The project is the second development phase of the Clair Field. The design capacity of the project is 120,000 barrels of crude oil and 100 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Production is scheduled to begin in 2017. The Clair Field has an estimated production life until 2050. Proved reserves have been recognized for the Clair Ridge Project. At the 40 percent-owned and operated Rosebank Project northwest of the Shetland Islands, the company continued to assess alternatives for the optimum development of the Rosebank Field and made significant progress in optimizing the Rosebank development plan. The design capacity of the project is 100,000 barrels of crude oil and 80 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. At the end of 2014, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project. West of the Shetland Islands, exploration activities included acquisition and interpretation of 3-D seismic data. In the central North Sea, an exploration well previously drilled to delineate the southern extension of the Jade Field was successfully tied back and first production was achieved. Sales of Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids  The company sells natural gas and natural gas liquids from its producing operations under a variety of contractual arrangements. In addition, the company also makes third-party purchases and sales of natural gas and natural gas liquids in connection with its supply and trading activities. During 2014 , U.S. and international sales of natural gas were 4.0 billion and 4.3 billion cubic feet per day, respectively, which includes the companys share of equity affiliates sales. Outside the United States, substantially all of the natural gas sales from the companys producing interests are from operations in Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Europe, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Latin America, Myanmar, Nigeria, the Philippines and Thailand. U.S. and international sales of natural gas liquids were 141,000 and 86,000 barrels per day, respectively, in 2014 . Substantially all of the international sales of natural gas liquids from the company's producing interests are from operations in Africa, Canada, Indonesia and the United Kingdom. Refer to Selected Operating Data, on page FS-11 in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further information on the companys sales volumes of natural gas and natural gas liquids. Refer also to Delivery Commitments beginning on page 6 for information related to the companys delivery commitments for the sale of crude oil and natural gas. Downstream Refining Operations At the end of 2014 , the company had a refining network capable of processing nearly 2 million barrels of crude oil per day. Operable capacity at December 31, 2014 , and daily refinery inputs for 2012 through 2014 for the company and affiliate refineries are summarized in the table below. Average crude oil distillation capacity utilization during 2014 was 87 percent, compared with 84 percent in 2013 . At the U.S. refineries, crude oil distillation capacity utilization averaged 91 percent in 2014 , compared with 81 percent in 2013 . Chevron processes both imported and domestic crude oil in its U.S. refining operations. Imported crude oil accounted for about 73 percent and 76 percent of Chevrons U.S. refinery inputs in 2014 and 2013 , respectively. At the Pascagoula Refinery, the 25,000 barrels-per-day premium base oil plant began commercial production in third quarter 2014. Elsewhere, work continued during 2014 on projects to improve refinery flexibility, reliability and capability to process lower cost feedstocks. A project to replace the atmospheric distillation column and other related equipment at the Salt Lake City Refinery was completed in mid-2014, resulting in improved plant reliability and feedstock flexibility. At the El Segundo Refinery, a project to replace six end-of-life coke drums was also completed during the year. At the Richmond, California refinery, a modernization project progressed, with certification of the Environmental Impact Report and approval of a conditional use permit by the Richmond City Council in July 2014. The company is now seeking to secure the further necessary approvals to resume construction. In addition, Chevron is evaluating the Hawaii refinery and related assets for possible divestment. Outside the United States, Caltex Australia Ltd., a 50 percent-owned affiliate, completed the conversion of the Kurnell, Australia, refinery to an import terminal in fourth quarter 2014. During 2014, Singapore Refining Company, Chevron's 50 percent-owned joint venture, initiated construction of a gasoline desulfurization facility and a cogeneration plant. The investment is expected to increase the refinery's capability to produce higher value gasoline and to improve energy efficiency.

In early 2014, construction commenced on the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project, which is expected to capitalize on advantaged feedstock sourced from shale gas development in North America. The project includes an ethane cracker with an annual design capacity of 1.5 million metric tons of ethylene to be located at the Cedar Bayou facility and two polyethylene units to be located in Old Ocean, Texas, with a combined annual design capacity of one million metric tons. Start-up is expected in 2017. Chevron Oronite Company develops, manufactures and markets performance additives for lubricating oils and fuels and conducts research and development for additive component and blended packages. At the end of 2014, the company manufactured, blended or conducted research at 10 locations around the world. In 2014, the company completed expansion projects at its manufacturing facilities in Singapore and Gonfreville, France. In addition, a final investment decision was reached in fourth quarter 2014 to build a carboxylate plant in Singapore, which is expected to be completed in 2017. Chevron also maintains a role in the petrochemical business through the operations of GS Caltex, a 50 percent-owned affiliate. GS Caltex manufactures aromatics, including benzene, toluene and xylene. These are base chemicals used to produce a range of products, including adhesives, plastics and textile fibers. GS Caltex also produces polypropylene, which is used to make food packaging, laboratory equipment and textiles. Transportation  Pipelines: Chevron owns and operates a network of crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquid, refined product and chemical pipelines and other infrastructure assets in the United States. In addition, Chevron operates pipelines for its 50 percent-owned CPChem affiliate. The company also has direct and indirect interests in other U.S. and international pipelines. During 2014, the company continued to optimize its portfolio of pipeline and infrastructure assets. Net pipeline mileage at the end of 2014 was 5,548, a reduction of 4,524 miles from 2013, mainly due to asset sales. Also in 2014, Chevron completed construction of a 136-mile, 24-inch crude oil pipeline from the Jack/St. Malo deepwater production facility to a platform in Green Canyon Block 19 on the U.S. Gulf of Mexico shelf, where there is an interconnect to pipelines delivering crude oil into Texas and Louisiana. Pipeline operations began with start-up of the production facilities in late 2014. Refer to pages 13 and 14 in the Upstream section for information on the West African Gas Pipeline, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline, the Western Route Export Pipeline and the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. Shipping: The company's marine fleet includes both U.S. and foreign-flagged vessels. The U.S.-flagged vessels are engaged primarily in transporting refined products, primarily in the coastal waters of the United States. The foreign-flagged vessels are engaged primarily in transporting crude oil from the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Black Sea, South America, Mexico and West Africa to ports in the United States, Europe, Australia and Asia, as well as refined products and feedstocks to and from various locations worldwide. In 2014, the company took delivery of three bareboat charter VLCCs and two Pacific Area Lightering vessels. The company also owns a 16.7 percent interest in each of seven LNG carriers transporting cargoes for the North West Shelf Venture in Australia. In 2014, the company took delivery of two new LNG carriers in support of its developing LNG portfolio. Other Businesses  Power and Energy Management: The company's power and energy management operation delivers comprehensive commercial, engineering and operational support services to improve power reliability and energy efficiency for Chevron's operations worldwide. The business operates a variety of power assets, including gas-fired cogeneration facilities within Chevron's San Joaquin Valley operations in California, and renewable power facilities in California, New Mexico and Wyoming. The business also manages Chevron's investments in six renewable power projects in California, Arizona and Texas. Chevron also has major geothermal operations in Indonesia and the Philippines. For additional information on the company's geothermal operations refer to page 15 in the Upstream section. Research and Technology:  Chevron's energy technology organization supports upstream and downstream businesses. The company conducts research, develops and qualifies technology, and provides technical services and competency development. The disciplines cover earth sciences, reservoir and production engineering, drilling and completions, facilities engineering, manufacturing, process technology, catalysis, technical computing and health, environment and safety. Chevron's information technology organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data management, security and network technology to provide a standardized digital infrastructure to enable Chevrons global operations and business processes. Chevron's technology ventures company supports Chevron's upstream and downstream businesses by sourcing and demonstrating emerging technologies and championing their integration into Chevrons operations. As of the end of 2014 , the company continued to source technologies in emerging materials, power systems, production enhancements, renewables, water management, information technologies and advanced biofuels, and to develop options for efficient management of Chevron's carbon footprint. Additionally, in 2014, the company made investments in start-up companies with technologies for pipeline integrity, efficient carbon dioxide capture from flue gas and big data management. Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain. Refer to Note 25 beginning on FS-59 for a summary of the company's research and development expenses. Environmental Protection:  The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and to minimize the impact of those that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address all credible and significant risks identified through site-specific risk and impact assessments. Chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs, Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation. To complement the companys capabilities, Chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives, including the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill Response, Ltd., which operates globally. The company is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the company is a member of the Subsea Well Response Project (SWRP). SWRPs objective is to further develop the industrys capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world. Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page FS-16 for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company's 2014 environmental expenditures. Refer to page FS-16 and Note 23 on page FS-58 for a discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. Refer also to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 22 through 24 for a discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change. ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors Chevron is a global energy company with a diversified business portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a history of generating sufficient cash to pay dividends and fund capital and exploratory expenditures. Nevertheless, some inherent risks could materially impact the companys results of operations or financial condition. Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices:  Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas or other actions imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risks. Chevron accepts the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process. As such, an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices. During extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil, the companys upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected, as will its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. The impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. The scope of Chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources:  The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if Chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions, the companys business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors: Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The companys operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes beyond its control, including hurricanes, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, civil unrest and other political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. Chevron utilizes comprehensive risk management systems to assess potential physical and other risks to its assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions involve uncertainty analysis, which incorporates potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, Chevron cannot predict the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. The companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight: Chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. Chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action: The company produces, transports, refines and markets materials with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, including information relating to Ecuador matters, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-42. The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure: The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition. Political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm Chevrons business:   The companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the companys operations, export and exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. In addition, changes in national or state environmental regulations, including those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing, could adversely affect the company's current or anticipated future operations and profitability. Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase Chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for Chevrons products:  Continued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it, and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the companys operations and financial results. International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, the companys activities in it and market conditions. Greenhouse gas emissions that could be regulated include those arising from the companys exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys products. Some of these activities, such as consumers and customers use of the companys products, as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the companys control. The effect of regulation on the companys financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the companys ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products. Material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products the company currently sells and adversely affect the companys sales volumes, revenues and margins. Changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period:  In preparing the companys periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and impairments to property, plant and equipment. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the companys business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

Certain Governmental Proceedings:  As previously disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, filed on February 21, 2014, on August 6, 2012, a piping failure and fire occurred at the Chevron U.S.A. Inc. refinery in Richmond, California. Various federal, state, and local agencies initiated investigations as a result of the incident. Based on its civil investigation, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a Finding of Violations (FOV) to Chevron on December 17, 2013, which includes 62 findings of alleged noncompliance at the refinery. The majority of these findings relate to the August 2012 fire and alleged violations of chemical-accident-prevention laws, but the FOV also addresses a number of release-reporting issues, some of which are unrelated to the fire. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. As previously disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, filed on February 21, 2014, in July 2009, the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) alleged that Chevron is obligated to pay stipulated civil penalties in conjunction with commitments Chevron undertook to install and operate certain air emission control equipment at its Hawaii Refinery pursuant to a Clean Air Act settlement with the United States EPA and the DOH. The company has disputed many of the allegations. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. As initially disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, filed on February 21, 2014, the State of New Mexico provided to Chevron a Notice of Violation on December 11, 2013, alleging that the flaring of fuel gas that occurred during periodic compressor purging events at the Chevron Buckeye CO2 plant resulted in hourly air emissions during these events in excess of the plant permit limits and alleging that the company had failed to timely report these excess emissions. The company has reached a settlement agreement with the State of New Mexico and paid a civil penalty of less than $100,000 to resolve the alleged violation . As initially disclosed in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2014, filed May 2, 2014, a fire was reported on February 11, 2014, at Chevron Appalachia, LLCs Lanco 7H well located in Dunkard Township, Greene County, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States (OSHA) initiated investigations as a result of the incident. Based on its civil investigation to date, the PA DEP has issued Chevron a Notice of Violation alleging nine separate incidents of noncompliance.

Business General Development of Business Summary Description of Chevron Chevron Corporation, * a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. A list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on page E-4. As of December 31, 2015 , Chevron had approximately 61,500 employees (including about 3,300 service station employees). Approximately 29,600 employees (including about 3,100 service station employees), or 48 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. Overview of Petroleum Industry Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets. Operating Environment Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-8 of this Form 10-K in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the companys current business environment and outlook. Chevrons Strategic Direction Chevrons primary objective is to create shareholder value and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream, the companys strategies are to grow profitably in core areas and build new legacy positions. In the downstream, the strategies are to deliver competitive returns and grow earnings across the value chain. The company also continues to apply commercial and functional excellence in supply, trading and transportation to enable the success of the upstream and downstream strategies, and to utilize technology across all its businesses to differentiate performance. Information about the company is available on the companys website at www.chevron.com . Information contained on the companys website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The companys Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on the companys website soon after such reports are filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The reports are also available on the SECs website at www.sec.gov . ________________________________________________________ * Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term Chevron and such terms as the company, the corporation, our, we and us may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include affiliates of Chevron  i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. Description of Business and Properties The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects * in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2015 , and assets as of the end of 2015 and 2014  for the United States and the companys international geographic areas  are in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page FS-37. Similar comparative data for the companys investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Notes 15 and 16 on pages FS-40 through FS-41. Refer to page FS-13 of this Form 10-K in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company's capital and exploratory expenditures. Upstream Reserves Refer to Table V beginning on page FS-65 for a tabulation of the companys proved net liquids (including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil) and natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2013 and each year-end from 2013 through 2015 . Reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ended December 31, 2015 , are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations. At December 31, 2015, 21 percent of the company's net proved reserves were located in Kazakhstan and 19 percent were located in the United States. The net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years 2013 through 2015 are shown in the following table: ##TABLE_START  At December 31       Liquids  Millions of barrels       Consolidated Companies 4,262  4,285  4,303  Affiliated Companies 2,000  1,964  2,042  Total Liquids 6,262  6,249  6,345  Natural Gas  Billions of cubic feet       Consolidated Companies 25,946  25,707  25,670  Affiliated Companies 3,491  3,409  3,476  Total Natural Gas 29,437  29,116  29,146  Oil-Equivalent  Millions of barrels *       Consolidated Companies 8,586  8,570  8,582  Affiliated Companies 2,582  2,532  2,621  Total Oil-Equivalent 11,168  11,102  11,203  ##TABLE_END* Oil-equivalent conversion ratio is 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas = 1 barrel of oil . ________________________________________________________ ##TABLE_START *  As used in this report, the term project may describe new upstream development activity, individual phases in a multiphase development, maintenance activities, certain existing assets, new investments in downstream and chemicals capacity, investments in emerging and sustainable energy activities, and certain other activities. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of the term project as it relates to any specific governmental law or regulation. ##TABLE_END 4 Net Production of Liquids and Natural Gas  The following table summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2015 and 2014 by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production of 2.622 million barrels per day in 2015 was up 2 percent from 2014 . Production increases from project ramp-ups in the United States and Bangladesh and production entitlement effects in several locations were partially offset by the Partitioned Zone shut-in, normal field declines and the effect of asset sales. Refer to the Results of Operations section beginning on page FS-6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2013 through 2015 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and natural gas, and refer to Table V on pages FS-68 and FS-69 for information on annual production by geographical region. ##TABLE_START     Components of Oil-Equivalent    Oil-Equivalent   Liquids   Natural Gas   Thousands of barrels per day (MBPD) (MBPD) 1   (MBPD)   (MMCFPD)   Millions of cubic feet per day (MMCFPD) 2014  2014  2014  United States 664  456  1,310 1,250  Other Americas          Argentina 25  21  23  Brazil 21  20  6  Canada 2 69  67  10  Colombia 31     186  Trinidad and Tobago 19     112  Total Other Americas 165  108  337  Africa          Angola 121  113  51  Chad 3       Democratic Republic of the Congo 3  2  1  Nigeria 286  246  236  Republic of Congo 16  14  11  Total Africa 434  383  301  Asia          Azerbaijan 28  26  12  Bangladesh 109  2  643  China 16  16     Indonesia 185  149  214  Kazakhstan 53  31  126  Myanmar 16     99  Partitioned Zone 4 81  78  18  Philippines 23  3  118  Thailand 238  63  1,033 1,046  Total Asia 749  368  2,332 2,276  Australia/Oceania          Australia 97  23  442  Total Australia/Oceania 97  23  442  Europe          Denmark 25  17  51  Netherlands 3       Norway 3        United Kingdom 47  32  88  Total Europe 80  52  173  Total Consolidated Companies 2,222 2,189  1,408 1,390  4,888 4,779  Affiliates 2,5 382  319  388  Total Including Affiliates 6  2,622 2,571  1,744 1,709  5,269 5,167            1 Oil-equivalent conversion ratio is 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas = 1 barrel of oil.  2 Includes synthetic oil: Canada, net 43  43     Venezuelan affiliate, net 31  31     3 Producing fields in Chad, the Netherlands and Norway were sold in 2014.  4 Located between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.          5 Volumes represent Chevrons share of production by affiliates, including Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan; Petroboscan, Petroindependiente and Petropiar in Venezuela; and Angola LNG in Angola.  6 Volumes include natural gas consumed in operations of 496 million and 523  million cubic feet per day in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver 160 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties through 2018 . The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the companys proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments are all based on contracts with indexed pricing terms. Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 1,343 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2016 through 2018 from operations in Australia, Colombia, Denmark and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the companys proved developed reserves in these countries. Development Activities Refer to Table I on page FS-61 for details associated with the companys development expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . The following table summarizes the companys net interest in productive and dry development wells completed in each of the past three years, and the status of the companys development wells drilling at December 31, 2015 .

Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page FS-16 for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company's 2015 environmental expenditures. Refer to page FS-16 and Note 24 on page FS-57 for a discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. Refer also to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 21 through 23 for a discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change. ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors Chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses. Many of these risks are not within the company's control and could materially impact the companys results of operations and financial condition. Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices  Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risks. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices. Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the companys upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the companys credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to debt markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns. In some cases, liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the companys suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the companys own results of operations and financial condition depends. The scope of Chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources  The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions, the companys business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The companys operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. Chevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions involve uncertainty analysis, which incorporates potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. The companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. Chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces, transports, refines and markets materials with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, including information relating to Ecuador matters, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-42. The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition. Political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm Chevrons business The companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the companys operations, export and exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. In addition, changes in national or state environmental regulations, including those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing, could adversely affect the company's current or anticipated future operations and profitability. Regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could increase Chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for Chevrons hydrocarbon and other products  Continued attention to issues concerning GHG emissions and climate change and potential mitigation through legislation and regulation could have a material impact on the companys operations and financial results. International agreements (e.g., the Paris Accord and the Kyoto Protocol) and national (e.g., carbon tax, cap-and-trade or efficiency standards), regional and state legislation (e.g., California's AB32 or other low carbon fuel standards) and regulatory measures (e.g., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's methane performance standards) to limit or reduce GHG emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation and it is difficult to predict with certainty their timing and outcome. These and other GHG emissions-related laws and regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbon-constrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the companys hydrocarbon-based products, make the companys products more expensive, and adversely affect the companys sales volumes, revenues and margins. GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, that could be regulated include, among others, those arising from the companys exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys hydrocarbon products. Some of these activities, such as consumers and customers use of the companys products, as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the companys control. Consideration of GHG issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the companys strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the companys long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential GHG emissions laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon dioxide injection, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction, the companys activities in it and market conditions. The ultimate effect of international agreements and national, regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions on the companys financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the companys ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products. Changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period  In preparing the companys periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and impairments to property, plant and equipment. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the companys business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

Legal Proceedings Governmental Proceedings  As initially disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, filed on February 21, 2014, on August 6, 2012, a piping failure and fire occurred at the Chevron U.S.A. Inc. refinery in Richmond, California. Various federal, state, and local agencies initiated investigations as a result of the incident. Based on its civil investigation, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a Finding of Violations (FOV) to Chevron on December 17, 2013, which includes 62 findings of alleged noncompliance at the refinery. The majority of these findings relate to the August 2012 fire and alleged violations of chemical-accident-prevention laws, but the FOV also addresses a number of release-reporting issues, some of which are unrelated to the fire. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. As initially disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, filed on February 21, 2014, in July 2009, the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) alleged that Chevron is obligated to pay stipulated civil penalties in conjunction with commitments Chevron undertook to install and operate certain air emission control equipment at its Hawaii Refinery pursuant to a Clean Air Act settlement with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the DOH. The company reached a settlement agreement with the EPA and the DOH and paid civil penalties totaling $230,958 to resolve the alleged violations. As initially disclosed in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2015, filed on November 6, 2015, on July 29, 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) notified Chevron that certain Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits it had submitted for compliance with the federal Renewable Fuel Standard for 2011 were invalid because they were fraudulently generated by a third party that sold the credits to Chevron. On September 30, 2015, Chevron received a civil penalty demand of $175,923 from the EPA for the submission of the invalid RINs. The company paid $175,923 in civil penalties to resolve the demand.

Business General Development of Business Summary Description of Chevron Chevron Corporation, * a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. A list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on page E-5 . As of December 31, 2016 , Chevron had approximately 55,200 employees (including about 3,200 service station employees). Approximately 26,500 employees (including about 3,100 service station employees), or 48 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. Overview of Petroleum Industry Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies, in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets. Operating Environment Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-9 of this Form 10-K in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the companys current business environment and outlook. Chevrons Strategic Direction Chevrons primary objective is to deliver industry-leading results and superior shareholder value in any business environment. In the upstream, the companys strategy is to deliver industry-leading returns while developing high-value resource opportunities. In the downstream, the company's strategy is to grow earnings across the value chain and make targeted investments to lead the industry in returns. Information about the company is available on the companys website at www.chevron.com . Information contained on the companys website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The companys Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on the companys website soon after such reports are filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The reports are also available on the SECs website at www.sec.gov . ________________________________________________________ * Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term Chevron and such terms as the company, the corporation, our, we and us may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include affiliates of Chevron  i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. Description of Business and Properties The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects * in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2016 , and assets as of the end of 2016 and 2015  for the United States and the companys international geographic areas  are in Note 1 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page FS-40 . Similar comparative data for the companys investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Notes 16 and 17 on pages FS-43 through FS-44 . Refer to page FS-14 of this Form 10-K in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company's capital and exploratory expenditures. Upstream Reserves Refer to Table V beginning on page FS-69 for a tabulation of the companys proved net liquids (including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil) and natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2014 and each year-end from 2014 through 2016 . Reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ended December 31, 2016 , are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations. At December 31, 2016 , 23 percent of the company's net proved oil-equivalent reserves were located in Kazakhstan, 20 percent were located in Australia and 18 percent were located in the United States. The net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years 2014 through 2016 are shown in the following table: ##TABLE_START  At December 31       Liquids  Millions of barrels       Consolidated Companies 4,131  4,262  4,285  Affiliated Companies 2,197  2,000  1,964  Total Liquids 6,328  6,262  6,249  Natural Gas  Billions of cubic feet       Consolidated Companies 25,432  25,946  25,707  Affiliated Companies 3,328  3,491  3,409  Total Natural Gas 28,760  29,437  29,116  Oil-Equivalent  Millions of barrels *       Consolidated Companies 8,370  8,586  8,570  Affiliated Companies 2,752  2,582  2,532  Total Oil-Equivalent 11,122  11,168  11,102  ##TABLE_END* Oil-equivalent conversion ratio is 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas = 1 barrel of crude oil . ________________________________________________________ ##TABLE_START *  As used in this report, the term project may describe new upstream development activity, individual phases in a multiphase development, maintenance activities, certain existing assets, new investments in downstream and chemicals capacity, investments in emerging and sustainable energy activities, and certain other activities. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of the term project as it relates to any specific governmental law or regulation. ##TABLE_END 4 Net Production of Liquids and Natural Gas  The following table summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2016 and 2015 by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production of 2.594 million barrels per day in 2016 was down 1 percent from 2015 . Production increases from major capital projects, shale and tight properties, and base business were more than offset by normal field declines, the impact of asset sales, the Partitioned Zone shut-in, the effects of civil unrest in Nigeria and planned turnaround activity.

Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver 140 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2017 through 2019 . The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the companys proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments are all based on contracts with indexed pricing terms. Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 1,913 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2017 through 2019 from operations in Australia, Colombia, Denmark, Indonesia and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the companys proved developed reserves in these countries. Development Activities Refer to Table I on page FS-65 for details associated with the companys development expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .

Chevrons 2016 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page FS-6 , are presented below. The comments include references to total production and net production, which are defined under Production in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-11 . The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not the companys share of costs for projects that are less than wholly owned. United States Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in the midcontinent region, the Gulf of Mexico, California and the Appalachian Basin. Net oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2016 averaged 691,000 barrels per day. The company's activities in the midcontinent region are primarily in Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. During 2016, net daily production in these areas averaged 123,000 barrels of crude oil, 576 million cubic feet of natural gas and 40,000 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs). In 2016, the company divested properties in areas including Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. The company is pursuing selected opportunities for divestment of additional properties in 2017. In the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeast New Mexico, the company holds approximately 500,000 and 1,000,000 net acres of shale and tight resources in the Midland and Delaware basins, respectively. This acreage includes multiple stacked formations that enable production from several layers of rock in different geologic zones. The stacked plays multiply the basins resource and economic potential by allowing for multiple horizontal wells to be developed from a single pad location using shared facilities and infrastructure, which reduces development costs and improves capital efficiency. Chevron has implemented a factory development strategy in the basin, which utilizes multiwell pads to drill multiple horizontal wells that are completed concurrently using multistage hydraulic fracture stimulation. The company drilled 93 wells and participated in 108 nonoperated wells in the Midland and Delaware basins in 2016. During 2016 , net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 158,000 barrels of crude oil, 183 million cubic feet of natural gas and 13,000 barrels of NGLs. The company divested selected shelf properties in 2016 and is pursuing divestment of additional shelf assets in 2017. Chevron is also engaged in various exploration, development and production activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The deepwater Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit (FPU) located between the two fields. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company operated. The company has a 40.6 percent interest in the production host facility, which is designed to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development and third-party tiebacks. Total daily production from the Jack and St. Malo fields in 2016 averaged 94,000 barrels of liquids (47,000 net) and 14 million cubic feet of natural gas (7 million net). Production ramp-up and development drilling for the first development phase continued in 2016. In addition, work continued on Stage 2, the second phase of the development plan, which includes four additional development wells, two each at the Jack and St. Malo fields. Start-up of the first Stage 2 development well was achieved in third quarter 2016. Development drilling is planned to continue in 2017. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. Production from the Jack/St. Malo development is expected to ramp up to a total daily rate of 128,000 barrels of crude oil and 33 million cubic feet of natural gas. The Jack and St. Malo fields have an estimated remaining production life of 30 years. At the 58 percent-owned and operated deepwater Tahiti Field, net daily production averaged 31,000 barrels of crude oil, 13 million cubic feet of natural gas, and 2,000 barrels of NGLs. Four infill production wells were completed in 2016. The next development phase, the Tahiti Vertical Expansion Project, achieved a final investment decision in mid-2016. The expansion project includes four new wells and associated subsea infrastructure. The four wells have been drilled and cased, and completion operations are underway. First oil is expected in 2018. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. The Tahiti Field has an estimated remaining production life of at least 20 years. The company has a 15.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the deepwater Mad Dog Field. In 2016, net daily production averaged 8,000 barrels of liquids and 1 million cubic feet of natural gas.

Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. During 2016 and early 2017, the company participated in five appraisal wells and four exploration wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Drilling was completed on an appraisal well at the Sicily discovery in first quarter 2016. No further operations are planned, and the leases expired in 2016. Drilling was completed on two successful appraisal wells at the Anchor discovery, one in second quarter 2016 and one in early 2017. Chevron is the operator of an exploration and appraisal program and potential development named Tigris, covering a number of jointly held offshore leases in the northwest portion of Keathley Canyon. This area may have the potential to support a cost-effective, deepwater hub development of multiple fields to a new central host. In 2016, two successful appraisal wells were drilled at the 41 percent-owned Tiber and the 50 percent-owned Guadalupe discoveries. The planned appraisal programs have been completed for the Tiber and Guadalupe discoveries and Chevron filed for Suspension of Production (SOP) on both the Tiber and Guadalupe units. The SOPs are intended to hold the associated leases as the planned development concept matures. Chevron added ten leases to its deepwater portfolio as a result of awards from the central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 241, held in first quarter 2016. In California, the company has significant production in the San Joaquin Valley. In 2016 , net daily production averaged 159,000 barrels of crude oil, 54 million cubic feet of natural gas and 3,000 barrels of NGLs.

The project includes an ethane cracker with an annual design capacity of 1.5 million metric tons of ethylene to be located at the Cedar Bayou facility and two polyethylene units to be located in Old Ocean, Texas, with a combined annual design capacity of one million metric tons. The polyethylene units are expected to start up mid-2017, and the ethane cracker in late 2017. Chevron also maintains a role in the petrochemical business through the operations of GS Caltex, a 50 percent-owned affiliate. GS Caltex manufactures aromatics, including benzene, toluene and xylene. These base chemicals are used to produce a range of products, including adhesives, plastics and textile fibers. GS Caltex also produces polypropylene, which is used to make automotive and home appliance parts, food packaging, laboratory equipment, and textiles. Transportation  Pipelines Chevron owns and operates a network of crude oil, natural gas and product pipelines and other infrastructure assets in the United States. In addition, Chevron operates pipelines for its 50 percent-owned CPChem affiliate. The company also has direct and indirect interests in other U.S. and international pipelines. Refer to pages 12 and 13 in the Upstream section for information on the West African Gas Pipeline, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline, the Western Route Export Pipeline and the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. Shipping The company's marine fleet includes both U.S.- and foreign-flagged vessels. The U.S.-flagged vessels are engaged primarily in transporting refined products in the coastal waters of the United States. The foreign-flagged vessels transport crude oil, LNG, refined products and feedstocks in support of the company's global Upstream and Downstream businesses. Four of the scheduled six new LNG carriers in support of the developing LNG portfolio are in service, with the final two scheduled for delivery in 2017. Other Businesses  Research and Technology  Chevron's energy technology organization supports upstream and downstream businesses. The company conducts research, develops and qualifies technology, and provides technical services and competency development. The disciplines cover earth sciences, reservoir and production engineering, drilling and completions, facilities engineering, manufacturing, process technology, catalysis, technical computing and health, environment and safety. Chevron's information technology organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data management, cybersecurity and network technology to provide a digital infrastructure to enable Chevrons global operations and business processes. Chevron's technology ventures company supports Chevron's upstream and downstream businesses by bridging the gap between business unit needs and emerging technology solutions developed externally in areas of emerging materials, water management, information technology, power systems and production enhancement. Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain. Refer to Note 28 beginning on page FS-63 for a summary of the company's research and development expenses. Environmental Protection  The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and to minimize the impact of those that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address all credible and significant risks identified through site-specific risk and impact assessments. Chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs, Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation. To complement the companys capabilities, Chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives, including the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill Response, Ltd., which operates globally. The company is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the company is a member of the Subsea Well Response Project, which has the objective to further develop the industrys capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world. The company is committed to improving energy efficiency in its day-to-day operations and is required to comply with the greenhouse gas-related laws and regulations to which it is subject. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 20 through 22 for further discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change and the associated risks to Chevrons business. Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page FS-18 for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company's 2016 environmental expenditures. Refer to page FS-18 and Note 2 5 on page FS-61 for a discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors Chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses. Many of these risks are not within the company's control and could materially impact the companys results of operations and financial condition. Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices  Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risks. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices. Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the companys upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the companys credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to debt markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns. In some cases, liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the companys suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the companys own results of operations and financial condition depends. The scope of Chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources  The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions, the companys business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The companys operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. Chevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. Cyberattacks targeting Chevrons process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the companys business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. Although Chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business. Cyber threat actors could compromise the companys process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or assets, access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information, including intellectual property, business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations. The companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. Chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces, transports, refines and markets materials with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, including information relating to Ecuador matters, see Note 1 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-45 . The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition. Political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm Chevrons business The companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the companys operations, export and exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. In addition, changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, could adversely affect the company's current or anticipated future operations and profitability. Regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could increase Chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for Chevrons hydrocarbon and other products  In the years ahead, companies in the energy industry, like Chevron, may be challenged by an increase in international and domestic regulation relating to GHG emissions. Such regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the companys oil and gas resources economically infeasible. Although the IEAs World Energy Outlook scenarios anticipate global demand for oil to continue increasing until 2040, and even GHG-constrained scenarios (such as the IEAs 450 case) anticipate significant demand for petroleum and natural gas given their respective advantages in transportation and power generation, if a new onset of regulation contributes to a decline in the demand for the companys products, this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition. International agreements (e.g., the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol) and national (e.g., carbon tax, cap-and-trade or efficiency standards), regional and state legislation (e.g., California AB32 and SB32; low carbon fuel standards) and regulatory measures (e.g., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's methane performance standards) that aim to limit or reduce GHG emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. For example, the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number of countries are adopting policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals. In the United States, the company has been complying with currently implemented programs such as the federal Renewable Fuel Standard program, and related volume standards, and state regulations such as California AB32, including the cap-and-trade program and related low carbon fuel standard obligations. Follow-on legislation to California AB32, known as California SB32, was signed into law in 2016, with effect in 2020, and is currently in the scoping plan phase. Separately, other states and localities have also sought to directly regulate GHG emissions through mechanisms such as, for example, a carbon tax. Many of the foregoing are still in a proposal stage and others face legal challenge or legislative efforts to be repealed or significantly reformed. Thus, even with respect to existing regulatory compliance obligations, the landscape continues to be in a state of constant re-assessment and legal challenge, making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact that such regulations will have on the company. GHG emissions-related laws and related regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbon-constrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the companys hydrocarbon-based products, make the companys products more expensive, adversely affect the economic feasibility of the companys resources, and adversely affect the companys sales volumes, revenues and margins. GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) that could be regulated include, among others, those associated with the companys exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys hydrocarbon products. Many of these activities, such as consumers and customers use of the companys products, as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the companys control. In addition, increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and, potentially, private litigation against the company. Consideration of GHG issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the companys strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the companys long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. Additionally, the company assesses carbon pricing risks by considering carbon costs in these forecasts. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon dioxide injection, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction, the companys activities in it and market conditions. The ultimate effect of international agreements and national, regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions on the companys financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products in the competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions-related agreements, legislation and measures on the companys financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes. Changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period  In preparing the companys periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the companys business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

Legal Proceedings Governmental Proceedings  As initially disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, on August 6, 2012, a piping failure and fire occurred at the Chevron refinery in Richmond, California. Various federal, state, and local agencies initiated investigations as a result of the incident. Based on a civil investigation conducted pursuant to its authority under the Clean Air Act Risk Management Plan program (RMP), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued alleged findings of violation to Chevrons Richmond refinery on December 17, 2013. The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) also issued citations related to the incident. Following the Richmond fire, EPA conducted RMP inspections at Chevrons El Segundo, California; Pascagoula, Mississippi; Kapolei, Hawaii; and Salt Lake City, Utah refineries. With the participation of the United States Department of Justice, Chevron and EPA are negotiating a potential combined resolution that may include all of EPAs alleged findings of violation related to the Richmond fire and subsequent RMP inspections. Resolution of the alleged findings of violation may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. Chevron and Cal/OSHA are separately negotiating a potential resolution of Cal/OSHAs citations related to the incident. Chevron facilities within the jurisdiction of Californias South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) currently have multiple outstanding Notices of Violation (NOVs) issued by SCAQMD. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. As initially disclosed in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, in April 2016, Chevron received a proposal from the SCAQMD seeking to collectively resolve certain NOVs issued in 2012 and 2013 to Chevrons El Segundo refinery. Subsequently, the SCAQMD provided notice to Chevron that it was also seeking to resolve certain NOVs issued to the refinery in 2014. Chevron and the SCAQMD are negotiating a potential combined resolution of the 2012-2014 NOVs. Collective resolution of these NOVs may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. Chevron facilities within the jurisdiction of Californias Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) currently have multiple outstanding NOVs issued by BAAQMD. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. On December 7, 2016, Chevron received a proposal from the BAAQMD seeking to collectively resolve certain NOVs issued in 2013-2015 to Chevrons Richmond refinery and to Chevrons Richmond, California and San Jose, California marketing terminals. Chevron and the BAAQMD are negotiating a potential combined resolution of the 2013-2015 NOVs. Collective resolution of these NOVs may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. On December 5, 2016, Chevron received a NOV from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) alleging that for compliance years 2011-2015, Chevron failed to deduct some exported volumes of fuel from the sales that must be reported under the states Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) program. The allegation is that Chevron purchased and retired more LCFS credits than were required. Chevron and CARB are negotiating a potential resolution of the alleged violation. Resolution of this NOV may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more.

Business General Development of Business Summary Description of Chevron Chevron Corporation, * a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. A list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on page E-2 . As of December 31, 2017 , Chevron had approximately 51,900 employees (including about 3,300 service station employees). Approximately 25,200 employees (including about 3,100 service station employees), or 49 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. Overview of Petroleum Industry Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies, in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets. Operating Environment Refer to pages 30 through 37 of this Form 10-K in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the companys current business environment and outlook. Chevrons Strategic Direction Chevrons primary objective is to deliver industry-leading results and superior shareholder value in any business environment.

Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver 151 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2018 through 2020 . The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the companys proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments are all based on contracts with indexed pricing terms. Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 2,380 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2018 through 2020 from operations in Australia, Colombia, Denmark, Indonesia and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the companys proved developed reserves in these countries. Development Activities Refer to Table I on page 91 for details associated with the companys development expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . The following table summarizes the companys net interest in productive and dry development wells completed in each of the past three years, and the status of the companys development wells drilling at December 31, 2017 .

Chevrons 2017 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page 34 , are presented below. The comments include references to total production and net production, which are defined under Production in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-8 . The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not the companys share of costs for projects that are less than wholly owned. United States Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in the midcontinent region, the Gulf of Mexico, California and the Appalachian Basin. Net oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2017 averaged 681,000 barrels per day. The company's activities in the midcontinent region are primarily in Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. During 2017, net daily production in these areas averaged 134,000 barrels of crude oil, 505 million cubic feet of natural gas and 50,000 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs). In 2017, the company divested properties in areas including Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. The company is pursuing selected opportunities and actively transacting to create value. In the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeast New Mexico, the company holds approximately 500,000 and 1,200,000 net acres of shale and tight resources in the Midland and Delaware basins, respectively. This acreage includes multiple stacked formations that enable production from several layers of rock in different geologic zones. The stacked plays multiply the basins resource and economic potential by allowing for multiple horizontal wells to be developed from a single pad location using shared facilities and infrastructure, which reduces development costs and improves capital efficiency. Chevron has implemented a factory development strategy in the basin, which utilizes multiwell pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are completed concurrently using hydraulic fracture stimulation. In 2017, the company deployed a new basis of design, resulting in improved economics. The company is also applying data analytics and petrophysical technology on its Permian well information to drive improvements in well targets and performance. The company drilled 130 wells and participated in 180 nonoperated wells in the Midland and Delaware basins in 2017. During 2017 , net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 165,000 barrels of crude oil, 122 million cubic feet of natural gas and 13,000 barrels of NGLs. In 2017, the company divested its remaining operated offshore assets in the shelf area. All remaining shelf assets are non-operated interests. Chevron is also engaged in various exploration, development and production activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The deepwater Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit (FPU) located between the two fields. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company operated. The company has a 40.6 percent interest in the production host facility, which is designed to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development and third-party tiebacks. Total daily production from the Jack and St. Malo fields in 2017 averaged 116,000 barrels of liquids (59,000 net) and 18 million cubic feet of natural gas (9 million net). Production ramp-up and development drilling for the first development phase was completed in 2017. In addition, development drilling continued on Stage 2, the second phase of the development plan, with three of the four planned wells completed. Stage 3 includes three additional development wells. Stage 3 drilling began in second quarter 2017; execution is expected to continue in 2018. Proved reserves have been recognized for these phases. Production from the Jack/St. Malo development is expected to ramp up to a total daily rate of 142,000 barrels of crude oil and 36 million cubic feet of natural gas. The Jack and St. Malo fields have an estimated remaining production life of 30 years. At the 58 percent-owned and operated deepwater Tahiti Field, net daily production averaged 45,000 barrels of crude oil, 18 million cubic feet of natural gas, and 3,000 barrels of NGLs. Infill drilling continued in 2017. The Tahiti Vertical Expansion Project is the next development phase of the Tahiti Field, developing shallower reservoirs and encompassing four new wells and associated subsea infrastructure. All wells have been drilled, and facility installation work has commenced. First oil is expected in second-half 2018. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. The Tahiti Field has an estimated production life of at least 20 years. The company has a 15.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the deepwater Mad Dog Field. In 2017, net daily production averaged 8,000 barrels of liquids and 1 million cubic feet of natural gas. The next development phase, the Mad Dog 2 Project, is planned to develop the southwestern extension of the Mad Dog Field. The development plan includes a new floating production platform with a design capacity of 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day. A final investment decision was reached in February 2017. First oil is expected in 2021.  At the end of 2017, proved reserves have been recognized for the Mad Dog 2 Project. The development plan for the 60 percent-owned and operated deepwater Big Foot Project includes a 15-slot drilling and production tension leg platform (TLP) with water injection facilities and a design capacity of 75,000 barrels of crude oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. The TLP has been moored in its final location; installation is expected to be completed in second quarter 2018. First oil is expected in late 2018. The field has an estimated production life of 35 years from the time of start-up. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. Chevron holds a 25 percent nonoperated working interest in the Stampede Project, the unitized development of the deepwater Knotty Head and Pony discoveries. The planned facilities have a design capacity of 80,000 barrels of crude oil and 40 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Installation of the TLP and subsea infrastructure was completed in 2017, with first oil achieved in January 2018. The field has an estimated production life of 30 years from the time of start-up. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. During 2017 and early 2018, the company participated in two appraisal wells and four exploration wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Chevron has operated working interests of 55 to 61.3 percent in the blocks containing the Anchor Field. The appraisal drilling program for the Anchor Field concluded in 2017 with the successful Anchor appraisal well. The company filed for Suspension of Production (SOP) in January 2018. The SOP is intended to hold the associated leases as the planned development matures. Activities are underway to mature a cost effective development plan. Chevron is the operator of an exploration and appraisal program and potential development named Tigris, covering several jointly held offshore leases in the northwest portion of Keathley Canyon. This area may have the potential to support a cost-effective, deepwater hub development of multiple fields to a new central host. Activities are underway to mature the development plan. Exploration and appraisal activities have been completed at the 50 percent-owned Tiber and Guadalupe fields. The company has obtained an SOP for the Tiber Unit, and recently filed for an SOP on the Guadalupe Unit. Adjacent leases containing the Gibson prospect are expected to be part of the development. During 2017 and early 2018, the company participated in successful discovery and appraisal wells at the nonoperated Whale prospect in the Perdido area, which resulted in a significant crude oil discovery. Chevron has a 40 percent working interest in the Whale prospect. Chevron announced a significant crude oil discovery in the 60 percent-owned and operated Ballymore prospect in January 2018. Ballymore is located in the Mississippi Canyon area, approximately 3 miles from Chevron's Blind Faith Platform. A sidetrack well is currently being drilled to further assess the discovery. Chevron added 35 leases to its deepwater portfolio as a result of awards from the central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 247, held in March 2017, and Lease Sale 249, held in August 2017. Chevron also added 10 additional leases through asset swaps. In California, the company has significant production in the San Joaquin Valley. In 2017 , net daily production averaged 148,000 barrels of crude oil, 53 million cubic feet of natural gas and 2,000 barrels of NGLs. The company holds approximately 423,000 net acres in the Marcellus Shale and 450,000 net acres in the Utica Shale, primarily located in southwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and the West Virginia panhandle. During 2017, net daily production in these areas averaged 290 million cubic feet of natural gas, 5,000 barrels of NGLs and 2,000 barrels of condensate. Chevron has implemented a factory development strategy, which enables co-development of the Marcellus and Utica shales from the same pads in stacked play locations. Other Americas Other Americas includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Greenland, Mexico, Suriname and Venezuela. Net oil-equivalent production from these countries averaged 210,000 barrels per day during 2017. Canada Upstream activities in Canada are concentrated in Alberta, British Columbia and the offshore Atlantic region. The company also has exploration interests in the Beaufort Sea region of the Northwest Territories. Net oil-equivalent production during 2017 averaged 98,000 barrels per day, composed of 36,000 barrels of crude oil, 65 million cubic feet of natural gas and 51,000 barrels of synthetic oil from oil sands. Chevron holds a 26.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Hibernia Field and a 23.7 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized Hibernia Southern Extension (HSE) areas offshore Atlantic Canada. The company holds a 29.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the heavy oil Hebron Field, also offshore Atlantic Canada. The development plan includes a platform with a design capacity of 150,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The platform was installed at the offshore location in June 2017. First oil was achieved in November 2017. The project has an expected economic life of 30 years. In the Flemish Pass Basin offshore Newfoundland, Chevron holds a 40 percent nonoperated working interest in two exploration blocks, EL1125 and EL1126. In addition, the company holds a 35 percent-owned and operated interest in Block EL1138.

Imported crude oil accounted for about 71 percent and 76 percent of Chevrons U.S. refinery inputs in 2017 and 2016 , respectively. In the United States, the company continued work on projects to improve refinery flexibility and reliability. At the Richmond, California, refinery, the modernization project continued to progress, with start-up of the new hydrogen plant scheduled for second-half 2018, and full operation of the project expected in 2019. At the Salt Lake City, Utah, refinery, construction began for the alkylation retrofit project in July 2017. Project start-up is expected in 2020. Outside the United States, the Singapore Refining Company (SRC), Chevron's 50 percent-owned joint venture, completed construction of gasoline clean fuels facilities and a cogeneration plant. The two trains at the cogeneration plant were commissioned in first-half 2017, enabling SRC to generate its own electricity and steam supply, improve energy efficiency, and significantly reduce greenhouse gas and sulfur oxide emissions. The gasoline clean fuels facilities enable SRC to produce higher-value gasoline that meets stricter emission standards. The company completed the sale of its refining assets in British Columbia, Canada, in September 2017. In addition, the company signed an agreement for the sale of its interests in the Cape Town Refinery in South Africa in 2017. The sale is expected to close in 2018, pending local government approval.

At year-end 2017 , the company supplied directly or through retailers and marketers approximately 7,700 Chevron- and Texaco-branded motor vehicle service stations, primarily in the southern and western states. Approximately 320 of these outlets are company-owned or -leased stations. Outside the United States, Chevron supplied directly or through retailers and marketers approximately 5,800 branded service stations, including affiliates. The company markets in Latin America using the Texaco brand. In the Asia-Pacific region, southern Africa and the Middle East, the company uses the Caltex brand. The company also operates through affiliates under various brand names. In South Korea, the company operates through its 50 percent-owned affiliate, GS Caltex. In 2017, the company opened Chevron branded stations in northwestern Mexico. In September 2017, the company completed the sale of its marketing assets in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. The company also signed an agreement for the sale of its marketing and lubricants businesses in southern Africa in 2017. The sale is expected to close in 2018, pending local government approval. Chevron markets commercial aviation fuel at approximately 100 airports worldwide. The company also markets an extensive line of lubricant and coolant products under the product names Havoline, Delo, Ursa, Meropa, Rando, Clarity and Taro in the United States and worldwide under the three brands: Chevron, Texaco and Caltex. Chemicals Operations Chevron Oronite Company develops, manufactures and markets performance additives for lubricating oils and fuels and conducts research and development for additive component and blended packages. At the end of 2017, the company manufactured, blended or conducted research at 10 locations around the world. In November 2017, the company commissioned a new carboxylate plant in Singapore. In 2017, design work continued for a planned manufacturing plant in Ningbo, China, with a final investment decision expected in 2018. Chevron owns a 50 percent interest in its Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) affiliate. CPChem produces olefins, polyolefins and alpha olefins and is a supplier of aromatics and polyethylene pipe, in addition to participating in the specialty chemical and specialty plastics markets. At the end of 2017 , CPChem owned or had joint-venture interests in 30 manufacturing facilities and two research and development centers around the world. During 2017, construction activities were completed on the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project, which is expected to capitalize on advantaged feedstock sourced from shale resource development in North America. The project includes an ethane cracker with an annual design capacity of 1.5 million metric tons of ethylene located at the Cedar Bayou facility and two polyethylene units located in Old Ocean, Texas, with a combined annual design capacity of one million metric tons. Start-up of the polyethylene units was achieved in September 2017. Mechanical completion of the ethane cracker was achieved in December 2017, with commissioning activities continuing in first quarter 2018 and transition to full production expected during second quarter 2018. Chevron also maintains a role in the petrochemical business through the operations of GS Caltex, a 50 percent-owned affiliate. GS Caltex manufactures aromatics, including benzene, toluene and xylene. These base chemicals are used to produce a range of products, including adhesives, plastics and textile fibers. GS Caltex also produces polypropylene, which is used to make automotive and home appliance parts, food packaging, laboratory equipment, and textiles. Transportation  Pipelines Chevron owns and operates a network of crude oil, natural gas and product pipelines and other infrastructure assets in the United States. In addition, Chevron operates pipelines for its 50 percent-owned CPChem affiliate. The company also has direct and indirect interests in other U.S. and international pipelines. Refer to pages 12 and 13 in the Upstream section for information on the West African Gas Pipeline, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline, the Western Route Export Pipeline and the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. Shipping The company's marine fleet includes both U.S.- and foreign-flagged vessels. The U.S.-flagged vessels are engaged primarily in transporting refined products in the coastal waters of the United States. The foreign-flagged vessels transport crude oil, LNG, refined products and feedstocks in support of the company's global Upstream and Downstream businesses. All six of the new LNG carriers in support of the company's growing LNG portfolio are in service, with the final two delivered in 2017. Other Businesses  Research and Technology  Chevron's energy technology organization supports upstream and downstream businesses. The company conducts research, develops and qualifies technology, and provides technical services and competency development. The disciplines cover earth sciences, reservoir and production engineering, drilling and completions, facilities engineering, manufacturing, process technology, catalysis, technical computing and health, environment and safety. Chevron's information technology organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data management, cybersecurity and network technology to provide a digital infrastructure to enable Chevrons global operations and business processes. Chevron's technology ventures company supports Chevron's upstream and downstream businesses by bridging the gap between business unit needs and emerging technology solutions developed externally in areas of emerging materials, water management, information technology, power systems and production enhancement. Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain. Refer to Note 27 beginning on page 89 for a summary of the company's research and development expenses. Environmental Protection  The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and to minimize the impact of those that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address all credible and significant risks identified through site-specific risk and impact assessments. Chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs, Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation. To complement the companys capabilities, Chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives, including the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill Response, Ltd., which operates globally. The company is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the company is a member of the Subsea Well Response Project, which has the objective to further develop the industrys capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world. The company is committed to improving energy efficiency in its day-to-day operations and is required to comply with the greenhouse gas-related laws and regulations to which it is subject. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 19 through 22 for further discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change and the associated risks to Chevrons business. Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 45 for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company's 2017 environmental expenditures. Refer to page 45 and Note 2 5 on page 88 for a discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors Chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses. Many of these risks are not within the company's control and could materially impact the companys results of operations and financial condition. Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices  Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or other producers, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risks. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices. Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the companys upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the companys credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to debt markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns. In some cases, liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the companys suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the companys own results of operations and financial condition depends. The scope of Chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources  The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions, the companys business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The companys operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. Chevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. Cyberattacks targeting Chevrons process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the companys business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the companys information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and third parties with which the company conducts business. Although Chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business. Cyber threat actors could compromise the companys process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or its assets, access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information, including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Further, the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on third-party IT systems, including the cloud. The company has limited control and visibility over such third-party IT systems. Cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations. The companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. Chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces, transports, refines and markets potentially hazardous materials, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, see Note 1 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page 71 . The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition. Political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevrons business The companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the companys operations, export and exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. Further, Chevron is required to comply with U.S. sanctions laws and regulations which, depending upon their scope, could adversely impact the company's operations in certain countries. In addition, changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, could adversely affect the company's current or anticipated future operations and profitability. Regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could increase Chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for Chevrons hydrocarbon and other products  In the years ahead, companies in the energy industry, like Chevron, may be challenged by an increase in international and domestic regulation relating to GHG emissions. Like any significant changes in the regulatory environment, GHG regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the companys oil and gas resources economically infeasible. Although the IEAs World Energy Outlook scenarios anticipate oil and gas continuing to make up a significant portion of the global energy mix through 2040 and beyond given their respective advantages in transportation and power generation, if a new onset of regulation contributes to a decline in the demand for the companys products, this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition. International agreements and national, regional and state legislation (e.g., California AB32, SB32 and AB398) and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce GHG emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. For example, the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number of countries are studying and adopting policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals. In some jurisdictions, the company is already subject to currently implemented programs such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard program, the European Union Emissions Trading System, and the California cap-and-trade program and related low carbon fuel standard obligations. Other jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate GHG emissions through similar or other mechanisms such as, for example, via a carbon tax (e.g., Singapore and Canada) or via a cap-and-trade program (e.g., Mexico and China). The landscape continues to be in a state of constant re-assessment and legal challenge with respect to these laws and regulations, making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate. GHG emissions-related laws and related regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbon-constrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the companys hydrocarbon-based products, make the companys products more expensive, adversely affect the economic feasibility of the companys resources, and adversely affect the companys sales volumes, revenues and margins. GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) that could be regulated include, among others, those associated with the companys exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys hydrocarbon products. Many of these activities, such as consumers and customers use of the companys products, as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the companys control. In addition, increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and additional private litigation against the company. Consideration of GHG issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the companys strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the companys long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. Additionally, the company assesses carbon pricing risks by considering carbon costs in these forecasts. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon dioxide injection, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction, the companys activities in it and market conditions. The ultimate effect of international agreements and national, regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions on the companys financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products in the competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions-related agreements, legislation and measures on the companys financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes. Changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period  In preparing the companys periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the companys business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

In addition, as initially disclosed in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, in April 2016, Chevron received a proposal from the SCAQMD seeking to collectively resolve certain NOVs issued in 2012 and 2013 to Chevrons El Segundo Refinery. Subsequently, the SCAQMD provided notice to Chevron that it was also seeking to resolve certain NOVs issued to the refinery in 2014. In December 2017, Chevron and the SCAQMD entered into a settlement agreement to resolve allegations in six NOVs for a civil penalty of $375,500. In January 2018, Chevron and the SCAQMD entered into a settlement agreement to resolve allegations associated with the remaining three NOVs for a civil penalty of $5,137,250. As initially disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, on August 6, 2012, a piping failure and fire occurred at the Chevron refinery in Richmond, California. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued alleged findings of violation related to the incident on December 17, 2013, pursuant to its authority under the Clean Air Act Risk Management Plan program (RMP). Following the Richmond incident, EPA also conducted RMP inspections at Chevrons El Segundo, California; Pascagoula, Mississippi; Kapolei, Hawaii; and Salt Lake City, Utah refineries. With the participation of the United States Department of Justice, Chevron and EPA are negotiating a potential combined resolution that may include all of EPAs alleged findings of violation related to the Richmond incident and subsequent RMP inspections. Resolution of those alleged findings of violation may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. As initially disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, on December 5, 2016, Chevron received a NOV from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) alleging that for compliance years 2011-2015, Chevron failed to deduct some exported volumes of fuel from the sales that must be reported under the states Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) program. The allegation is that Chevron purchased and retired more LCFS credits than were required. Chevron and CARB are negotiating a potential resolution of the alleged violation. Resolution of this NOV may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. As initially disclosed in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017,  on November 18, 2016, Chevron received an Administrative Order (AO) from the EPA alleging noncompliance with the water permit that governed conveyances of captured groundwater and spring water from the former Questa mine located in New Mexico to its associated tailing facility. Chevron is concluding its negotiations with EPA regarding this matter. As initially disclosed in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, on August 3, 2017, Chevron received a Notice of Intent to File an Administrative Complaint from the EPA in connection with certain waste matters at the Kapolei, Hawaii refinery during the period of time that the facility was owned and operated by Chevron.

Business Environment and Outlook Chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of Congo, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela. Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil. The price of crude oil has fallen significantly since mid-year 2014. The downturn in the price of crude oil has impacted the company's results of operations, cash flows, leverage, capital and exploratory investment program and production outlook. A sustained lower price environment could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods. The company has responded with reductions in operating expenses, pacing and re-focusing of capital and exploratory expenditures, and increased asset sales. The company anticipates that crude oil prices will increase in the future, as continued growth in demand and a slowing in supply growth should bring global markets into balance; however, the timing of any such increase is unknown. In the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. It is the company's objective to deliver competitive results and shareholder value in any business environment. The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. Note 1 8 provides the companys effective income tax rate for the last three years. Refer to the \"Cautionary Statement Relevant to Forward-Looking Information\" on page 2 and to \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 19 through 22 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company's results of operations or financial condition. The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the companys financial Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations performance and value growth. The company's asset sale program for 2016 and 2017 targeted before-tax proceeds of $5-10 billion. Proceeds and deposits related to asset sales were $2.8 billion in 2016 and $5.2 billion in 2017. Refer to the Results of Operations section beginning on page 34 for discussions of net gains on asset sales during 2017 . Asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses. The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning. Comments related to earnings trends for the companys major business areas are as follows: Upstream  Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or other producers, actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the companys production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the companys ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax laws and regulations. The company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. However, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the companys control including, among other things, the general level of inflation, commodity prices and prices charged by the industrys material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industrys own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. Industry cost inflation in most onshore segments, including North America unconventionals, started to modestly rise in 2017 with increases in commodity prices and higher levels of activity and investment. Offshore costs continue to decline driven by lower offshore activity levels and increased competition among suppliers. Capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses could also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, or other factors. The chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $54 per barrel for the full-year 2017 , compared to $44 in 2016 . As of mid-February 2018 , the Brent price was $62 per barrel. The majority of the companys equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark. Crude oil prices were better supported in 2017 amid firming demand, rising geopolitical tensions, and ongoing output reductions by OPEC and certain non-OPEC producers. However, upside was limited as rebounding U.S. and other non-OPEC production resulted in ongoing oversupplied conditions. Prices weakened gradually over the first half of 2017 due to concerns that OPEC cuts would be allowed to expire in June 2017, but firmed over the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations second half of 2017 after OPECs decision on May 25, 2017, to extend cuts through the first quarter of 2018. Price support was reinforced on November 30, 2017, when OPEC and their non-OPEC partners agreed to further extend output cuts through December 2018. The WTI price averaged $51 per barrel for the full-year 2017 , compared to $43 in 2016 . As of mid-February 2018 , the WTI price was $59 per barrel. WTI traded at a discount to Brent throughout 2017. After starting 2017 at a $2 discount to Brent, the WTI discount expanded to about $6 by year-end due to rising U.S. crude production, rebounding inventories, and growing concerns that pipeline infrastructure constraints would again restrict flows to export outlets on the Gulf Coast. A differential in crude oil prices exists between high-gravity, low-sulfur crudes and low-gravity, high-sulfur crudes. The amount of the differential in any period is associated with the relative supply/demand balances for each crude type. In second-half 2017, the differential held generally steady in North America as robust refinery demand supported heavy crude values, while light sweet crude prices in the U.S. were supported by rising exports of domestic production. Outside of North America, differentials were steady to modestly wider amid well-supplied light sweet crude markets in the Atlantic Basin, while rising U.S. exports to Asia increased competitive pressure on Middle East exports to the region. Chevron has producing interests in heavy crude oil in California, Indonesia, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Venezuela and in certain fields in Angola, China and the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea. (See page 39 for the companys average U.S. and international crude oil realizations.) In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. Fluctuations in the price of natural gas in the United States are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced and stored in North America. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged $2.97 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) during 2017 , compared with $2.46 during 2016 . As of mid-February 2018 , the Henry Hub spot price was $2.57 per MCF. Outside the United States, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. Chevron sells natural gas into the domestic pipeline market in most locations. In some locations, Chevron has invested in long-term projects to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. The company's long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG offtake from the operated Australian LNG projects is committed under binding long-term contracts, with the remainder to be sold in the Asian spot LNG market. The Asian spot market reflects the supply and demand for LNG in the Pacific Basin and is not directly linked to crude oil prices. International natural gas realizations averaged $4.62 per MCF during 2017 , compared with $4.02 per MCF during 2016 . (See page 39 for the companys average natural gas realizations for the U.S. and international regions.) The companys worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2017 averaged 2.728 million barrels per day. About one-sixth of the companys net oil-equivalent production in 2017 occurred in the OPEC-member countries of Angola, Nigeria and Venezuela. OPEC quotas had no effect on the companys net crude oil production in 2017 or 2016 . The company estimates that net oil-equivalent production in 2018 will grow 4 to 7 percent compared to 2017 , assuming a Brent crude oil price of $60 per barrel and excluding the impact of anticipated 2018 asset sales. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction, start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. Investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDIn the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, production was shut-in beginning in May 2015 as a result of difficulties in securing work and equipment permits. Net oil-equivalent production in the Partitioned Zone in 2014 was 81,000 barrels per day. During 2015, net oil-equivalent production averaged 28,000 barrels per day. As of early 2018, production remains shut in and the exact timing of a production restart is uncertain and dependent on dispute resolution between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The financial effects from the loss of production in 2017 were not significant and are not expected to be significant in 2018. Net proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 11.7 billion barrels of oil-equivalent at year-end 2017 , an increase of 5 percent from year-end 2016 . The reserve replacement ratio in 2017 was 155 percent. Refer to Table V beginning on page 95 for a tabulation of the companys proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2015 and each year-end from 2015 through 2017 , and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending December 31, 2017 . Refer to the Results of Operations section on pages 34 through 37 for additional discussion of the companys upstream business. Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events. Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the companys refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the companys shipping operations, which are driven by the industrys demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the companys control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the companys refining, marketing and petrochemical assets. The companys most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States, Asia and southern Africa. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. Refer to the Results of Operations section on pages 34 through 37 for additional discussion of the companys downstream operations. All Other  consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Operating Developments  Key operating developments and other events during 2017 and early 2018 included the following: Upstream  Angola  Commenced production from the main production facility of the Mafumeira Sul Project. Australia  Achieved start-up of Train 3 at the Gorgon LNG Project and Train 1 at the Wheatstone LNG Project. Canada  Achieved start-up of the Hebron Project. Indonesia Completed the sale of the geothermal business. United States Announced significant crude oil discoveries at the Whale and Ballymore prospects in the Gulf of Mexico. Downstream  Canada Completed the sale of refining and marketing assets in British Columbia and Alberta. United States The companys 50 percent-owned affiliate, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC achieved start-up of two polyethylene units and reached mechanical completion of a new ethane cracker at its U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project in Texas. Other  Common Stock Dividends The 2017 annual dividend was $4.32 per share, making 2017 the 30th consecutive year that the company increased its annual dividend payout. In January 2018, the company's Board of Directors approved a $0.04 per share increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.12 per share, payable in March 2018. Results of Operations  The following section presents the results of operations and variances on an after-tax basis for the companys business segments  Upstream and Downstream  as well as for All Other. Earnings are also presented for the U.S. and international geographic areas of the Upstream and Downstream business segments. Refer to Note 1 5 , beginning on page 67 , for a discussion of the companys reportable segments. This section should also be read in conjunction with the discussion in Business Environment and Outlook on pages 30 through 33 . ##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDU.S. Upstream  ##TABLE_START Millions of dollars    Earnings $ 3,640   $ (2,054 )  $ (4,055 ) ##TABLE_ENDU.S. upstream earnings were $3.64 billion in 2017 , compared with a loss of $2.05 billion in 2016 . The improvement in earnings reflected a benefit of $3.33 billion from U.S. tax reform, higher crude oil and natural gas realizations of $1.3 billion Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and lower depreciation expenses of $650 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in impairments and other asset write-offs. Lower operating expenses of $140 million also contributed to the improvement. U.S. upstream operations incurred a loss of $2.05 billion in 2016 , compared with a loss of $4.06 billion from 2015 . The improvement was due to lower depreciation expense of $1.2 billion and lower exploration expense of $780 million primarily reflecting a decrease in impairments and project cancellations. Also contributing to the improvement were lower operating expenses of $600 million and lower tax items of $190 million. Partially offsetting these effects were lower crude oil and natural gas realizations of $920 million. The companys average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2017 was $44.53 per barrel, compared with $35.00 in 2016 and $42.70 in 2015 . The average natural gas realization was $2.10 per thousand cubic feet in 2017 , compared with $1.59 in 2016 and $1.92 in 2015 . Net oil-equivalent production in 2017 averaged 681,000 barrels per day, down 1 percent from 2016 and down 5 percent from 2015 . Between 2017 and 2016 , production increases from shale and tight properties in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and base business in the Gulf of Mexico were more than offset by the effect of asset sales of 59,000 barrels per day and normal field declines. Between 2016 and 2015 , production increases from shale and tight properties in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, and base business were more than offset by the effect of asset sales and normal field declines. The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2017 averaged 519,000 barrels per day, up 3 percent from 2016 and 4 percent from 2015 . Net natural gas production averaged about 970 million cubic feet per day in 2017 , down 13 percent from 2016 and 26 percent from 2015 , primarily as a result of asset sales. Refer to the Selected Operating Data table on page 39 for a three-year comparison of production volumes in the United States. International Upstream ##TABLE_START Millions of dollars    Earnings * $ 4,510   $ (483 )  $ 2,094 * Includes foreign currency effects: $ (456 )   $  $ ##TABLE_ENDInternational upstream earnings were $4.51 billion in 2017 , compared with a loss of $483 million in 2016 . The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher crude oil realizations of $2.59 billion, higher natural gas sales volumes of $1.22 billion, higher gains on asset sales of $750 million, and lower operating expenses of $410 million. Foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact on earnings of $578 million between periods. International upstream incurred a loss of $483 million in 2016 , compared with earnings of $2.09 billion in 2015 . The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower crude oil realizations of $1.89 billion, lower natural gas realizations of $600 million, lower gains on asset sales of $450 million and higher tax items of $330 million. Partially offsetting the decrease were lower exploration and operating expenses of $640 million and $520 million, respectively, and higher natural gas sales volumes of $330 million. Foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact on earnings of $603 million between periods. The companys average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2017 was $49.46 per barrel, compared with $38.61 in 2016 and $46.52 in 2015 . The average natural gas realization was $4.62 per thousand cubic feet in 2017 , compared with $4.02 and $4.53 in 2016 and 2015 , respectively. International net oil-equivalent production was 2.05 million barrels per day in 2017 , up 8 percent from 2016 and 2015 . Between 2017 and 2016 , production increases from major capital projects and lower planned maintenance-related downtime were partially offset by production entitlement effects in several locations and normal field declines. Between 2016 and 2015 , production increases from major capital projects, base business, and shale and tight properties were largely offset by normal field declines, the Partitioned Zone shut-in, the impact of civil unrest in Nigeria and planned turnaround activity. The net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was 1.20 million barrels per day in 2017 , down 1 percent from 2016 and down 3 percent from 2015 .

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations U.S. Downstream ##TABLE_START Millions of dollars    Earnings $ 2,938   $ 1,307  $ 3,182 ##TABLE_ENDU.S. downstream operations earned $2.94 billion in 2017 , compared with $1.31 billion in 2016 . The increase was primarily due to a $1.16 billion benefit from U.S. tax reform, higher margins on refined product sales of $380 million, lower operating expenses of $160 million, and the absence of an asset impairment of $110 million. Partially offsetting this increase were lower gains on asset sales of $90 million and lower earnings from the 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemicals Company LLC of $70 million, primarily reflecting the impacts from Hurricane Harvey. U.S. downstream operations earned $1.31 billion in 2016 , compared with $3.18 billion in 2015 . The decrease was due to lower margins on refined product sales of $1.45 billion, lower earnings from the 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemicals Company LLC of $400 million and an asset impairment of $110 million. Partially offsetting this decrease were lower operating expenses of $80 million and higher gains on asset sales of $110 million. Refined product sales of 1.20 million barrels per day in 2017 were down 1 percent, primarily due to divestment of Hawaii refining and marketing assets in fourth quarter 2016. Sales volumes of refined products were 1.21 million barrels per day in 2016 , a decrease of 1 percent from 2015 , mainly reflecting lower sales of diesel. U.S. branded gasoline sales of 528,000 barrels per day in 2017 decreased 1 percent from 2016 and increased 1 percent from 2015 . Refer to the Selected Operating Data table on page 39 for a three-year comparison of sales volumes of gasoline and other refined products and refinery input volumes.

The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher gains on asset sales of $360 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $140 million. Foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact on earnings of $65 million between periods. International downstream earned $2.13 billion in 2016 , compared with $4.42 billion in 2015 . The decrease in earnings was primarily due to the absence of a $1.6 billion gain from the sale of the company's interest in Caltex Australia Limited in 2015, partially offset by 2016 asset sales gains of $420 million. Lower margins on refined product sales of $1.14 billion also contributed to the decline. Partially offsetting these decreases were lower operating expenses of $240 million. Foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact on earnings of $72 million between periods. Total refined product sales of 1.49 million barrels per day in 2017 were up 2 percent from 2016 , primarily due to higher diesel and jet fuel sales. Sales of 1.46 million barrels per day in 2016 were down 3 percent from 2015 . Excluding the effects of the Caltex Australia Limited divestment, refined product sales were down 1 percent, primarily reflecting lower fuel oil sales.

Net charges in 2017 increased $2.77 billion from 2016 , mainly due to higher tax items, primarily reflecting a $2.47 billion expense from U.S. tax reform, higher interest expense and a reclamation related charge for a former mining asset, partially offset by lower employee expense. Foreign currency effects decreased net charges by $139 million between periods. Net Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations charges in 2016 increased $342 million from 2015 , mainly due to higher corporate charges, interest expense and corporate tax items, partially offset by lower environmental reserve additions and lower charges related to reductions in corporate staffs.

Interest income was approximately $107 million in 2017 , $145 million in 2016 and $119 million in 2015 . Foreign currency effects decreased other income by $131 million in 2017 , and $186 million in 2016 and increased other income $82 million in 2015 . ##TABLE_START Millions of dollars    Purchased crude oil and products $ 75,765   $ 59,321  $ 69,751 ##TABLE_ENDCrude oil and product purchases increased $16.4 billion in 2017 primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product prices, and higher refined product and crude oil volumes. The decrease between 2016 and 2015 of $10.4 billion was primarily due to lower crude oil and refined product prices, partially offset by an increase in crude oil volumes. ##TABLE_START Millions of dollars    Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 23,885   $ 24,952  $ 27,477 ##TABLE_ENDOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $1.1 billion between 2017 and 2016 . The decrease included lower employee expenses of $690 million and non-operated joint venture expenses of $380 million. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $2.5 billion between 2016 and 2015 . The decrease included lower employee expenses of $800 million, transportation expenses of $680 million, contract labor expenses of $370 million, materials and supplies expenses of $310 million, and fuel expenses of $310 million. ##TABLE_START Millions of dollars    Exploration expense $   $ 1,033  $ 3,340 ##TABLE_ENDExploration expenses in 2017 decreased from 2016 primarily due to lower charges for well write-offs. Exploration expenses in 2016 decreased from 2015 primarily due to significantly higher 2015 charges for well write-offs largely related to project cancellations, and lower 2016 geological and geophysical expenses. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_START Millions of dollars    Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 19,349   $ 19,457  $ 21,037 ##TABLE_ENDDepreciation, depletion and amortization expenses decreased in 2017 from 2016 mainly due to lower impairments and lower depreciation rates for certain oil and gas producing properties, and the absence of a 2016 impairment of a downstream asset. Partially offsetting the decrease were higher production levels, accretion and write-offs for certain oil and gas producing fields, and a reclamation related charge for a former mining asset. The decrease in 2016 from 2015 was primarily due to lower impairments of certain oil and gas producing fields of about $3.0 billion in 2016 compared with about $3.5 billion in 2015. Also contributing to the decrease were lower production levels and accretion expenses for certain oil and gas producing fields. ##TABLE_START Millions of dollars    Taxes other than on income $ 12,331   $ 11,668  $ 12,030 ##TABLE_ENDTaxes other than on income increased in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to higher duties, higher crude oil, refined product and natural gas sales, and higher production. Taxes other than on income decreased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil prices, and the divestment of the Pakistan fuels business at the end of June 2015. ##TABLE_START Millions of dollars    Income tax (benefit) expense $ (48 )   $ (1,729 )  $ ##TABLE_END The decline in income tax benefit in 2017 of $1.68 billion is due to the increase in total income before tax for the company of $11.38 billion and the remeasurement impacts of U.S. tax reform. U.S. losses before tax decreased from a loss of $4.32 billion in 2016 to a loss of $441 million in 2017. This decrease in losses before tax was primarily driven by the effect of higher crude oil prices. The U.S. tax benefit increased by $650 million between year-over-year periods from $2.32 billion in 2016 to $2.97 billion in 2017. The U.S. tax benefit for 2017 included a $2.02 billion benefit from U.S. tax reform, which primarily reflected the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a reduction of $1.37 billion as result of the impact of a decrease in losses before tax of $3.88 billion. International income before tax increased from $2.16 billion in 2016 to $9.66 billion in 2017. This $7.50 billion increase was primarily driven by the effect of higher crude oil prices and gains on asset sales primarily in Indonesia and Canada. The higher crude prices primarily drove the $2.34 billion increase in international income tax expense between year-over-year periods, from $588 million in 2016 to $2.93 billion in 2017. Refer also to the discussion of the effective income tax rate in Note 1 8 on page 75 . The decline in income tax expense in 2016 of $1.86 billion is consistent with the decline in total income before tax for the company of $7.00 billion. U.S. losses before tax increased from a loss of $2.88 billion in 2015 to a loss of $4.32 billion in 2016. This $1.44 billion increase in losses was primarily driven by the effect of lower crude oil prices. The increase in losses had a direct impact on the companys U.S. income tax benefit, resulting in an increase of $624 million between year-over-year periods, from a tax benefit of $1.69 billion in 2015 to a tax benefit of $2.32 billion in 2016. International income before tax was reduced between calendar years from $7.72 billion in 2015 to $2.16 billion in 2016. This $5.56 billion decline was also primarily driven by the effect of lower crude oil prices. This effect drove the $1.24 billion reduction in international income tax expense between year-over-year periods, from $1.83 billion in 2015 to $588 million in 2016. Refer also to the discussion of the effective income tax rate in Note 1 8 on page 75 .

The company also continued to reduce cash outlays and increase asset sales. Progress on these actions during 2017 included: ##TABLE_START  Reducing cash capital expenditures to $13.4 billion, a 26 percent decrease compared to 2016, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Reducing operating and administrative expenses by $1.1 billion, a 4 percent decrease compared to 2016, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Realizing net proceeds from asset sales of $5.2 billion during 2017. ##TABLE_END The strength of the companys balance sheet enabled it to fund any timing differences throughout the year between cash inflows and outflows. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities  Total balances were $4.8 billion and $7.0 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was $20.5 billion , compared with $12.8 billion in 2016 and $19.5 billion in 2015 , reflecting higher crude oil prices. Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately $1.0 billion in 2017 and $0.9 billion in both 2016 and 2015 . Cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $5.2 billion in 2017 , $2.8 billion in 2016 , and $5.7 billion in 2015 . Restricted cash of $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, was held in cash and short-term marketable securities and recorded as Deferred charges and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are generally associated with upstream abandonment activities, tax payments, funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges and refundable deposits related to pending asset sales. Dividends Dividends paid to common stockholders were $8.1 billion in 2017 , $8.0 billion in 2016 and $8.0 billion in 2015 . Debt and Capital Lease Obligations  Total debt and capital lease obligations were $38.8 billion at December 31, 2017 , down from $46.1 billion at year-end 2016 . The $7.3 billion decrease in total debt and capital lease obligations during 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in short-term obligations reflecting higher crude oil prices. The company completed a bond issuance of $4.0 billion in first quarter 2017 and repaid long-term notes totaling $6.2 billion that matured in February, November and December 2017. The companys debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $15.2 billion at December 31, 2017 , compared with $19.8 billion at year-end 2016 . Of these amounts, $10.0 billion and $9.0 billion were reclassified to long-term debt at the end of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations At year-end 2017 , settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2018 , as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. Chevron has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in August 2018 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company. ##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDThe major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the companys debt, and the companys cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation and Texaco Capital Inc. All of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA- by Standard and Poors Corporation and Aa2 by Moodys Investors Service. The companys U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poors and P-1 by Moodys. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities. The companys future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company can also modify capital spending plans to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and also remain committed to retaining the companys high-quality debt ratings. Committed Credit Facilities Information related to committed credit facilities is included in Note 19 , Short-Term Debt, on page 78 . Common Stock Repurchase Program In July 2010, the Board of Directors approved an ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. The company did not acquire any shares under the program in 2017 or 2016 . From the inception of the program through 2014, the company had purchased 180.9 million shares for $20.0 billion. Capital and Exploratory Expenditures  Capital and exploratory expenditures by business segment for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 are as follows: ##TABLE_START         Millions of dollars U.S. Intl.

In 2016 and 2015 , expenditures were $ 22.4 billion and $ 34.0 billion, respectively, including the companys share of affiliates expenditures of $ 3.8 billion and $ 3.4 billion, respectively. Of the $18.8 billion of expenditures in 2017 , 87 percent , or $16.4 billion , related to upstream activities. Approximately 90 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2016 and 92 percent in 2015 . International upstream accounted for 69 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2017 , 77 percent in 2016 and 76 percent in 2015 . The company estimates that 2018 capital and exploratory expenditures will be $18.3 billion, including $5.5 billion of spending by affiliates. This planned reduction, compared to 2017 expenditures, reflects project completions, improved efficiencies, and investment high-grading, including the full funding of the company's advantaged Permian Basin position. Approximately 86 percent of the total, or $15.8 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities. Approximately $8.7 billion of planned upstream capital spending relates to base producing assets, including $3.3 billion for the Permian and $1.0 billion for other shale and tight rock investments. Approximately $5.5 billion of the upstream program is planned for major capital projects underway, including $3.7 billion associated with the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project at the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan. Global exploration funding is expected to be about $1.1 billion. Remaining upstream spend is budgeted for early stage projects supporting potential future developments. The company will continue to monitor crude oil market conditions and expects to further restrict capital outlays should oil price conditions deteriorate. Worldwide downstream spending in 2018 is estimated to be $2.2 billion, with $1.4 billion estimated for projects in the United States. Investments in technology companies and other corporate businesses in 2018 are budgeted at $0.3 billion. Noncontrolling Interests The company had noncontrolling interests of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . Distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled $78 million and $63 million in 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Pension Obligations  Information related to pension plan contributions is included on page 82 in Note 2 3 , Employee Benefit Plans, under the heading Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.

The current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that Chevrons inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. At year-end 2017 , the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $3.9 billion . Interest Coverage Ratio  Income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the companys ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. The companys interest coverage ratio in 2017 was higher than 2016 and 2015 due to higher income. Debt Ratio Total debt as a percentage of total debt plus Chevron Corporation Stockholders' Equity, which indicates the companys leverage. The company's debt ratio was 20.7 percent at year-end 2017 , compared with 24.1 percent and 20.2 percent at year-end 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Guarantees and Other Contingencies  Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements  The company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the companys business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2018  $1.4 billion ; 2019  $1.4 billion ; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 2020  $1.0 billion ; 2021  $0.9 billion ; 2022  $0.5 billion; 2023 and after  $2.6 billion . A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately $1.3 billion in 2017 , $1.3 billion in 2016 and $1.9 billion in 2015 . The following table summarizes the companys significant contractual obligations: ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Period  Millions of dollars Total 1   2019-2020  2021-2022  After 2022 On Balance Sheet: 2          Short-Term Debt 3 $ 5,194  $ 5,194  $   $   $  Long-Term Debt 3 33,512    20,054  6,104  7,354 Noncancelable Capital Lease Obligations     Interest 4,078   1,173   1,269 Off Balance Sheet:          Noncancelable Operating Lease Obligations 2,895   1,102   Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements 4 5,277   1,285   2,471 Other Unconditional Purchase Obligations 4 2,560   1,109   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Excludes contributions for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans.

Of this amount, $712 million is associated with a financing arrangement with an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 4 -year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum amount will be reduced as payments are made by the affiliate. The remaining amount of $370 million is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 10 -year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for either guarantee. Indemnifications  Information related to indemnifications is included on page 88 in Note 2 5 , Other Contingencies and Commitments, under the heading Indemnifications. Financial and Derivative Instrument Market Risk  The market risk associated with the companys portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below. The estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the companys projection of future market changes. The actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, of the companys 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Derivative Commodity Instruments Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities were not material to the companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2017 . The companys market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal Risk Control group in accordance with the companys risk management policies. The company's risk management practices and its compliance with policies are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the companys Board of Directors. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value of Chevrons derivative commodity instruments in 2017 was not material to the company's results of operations. The company uses the Monte Carlo simulation method as its Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value, at the 95% confidence level with a one-day holding period, from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. Based on these inputs, the VaR for the company's primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was not material to the company's cash flows or results of operations. Foreign Currency  The company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2017 . Interest Rates  The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At year-end 2017 , the company had no interest rate swaps. Transactions With Related Parties  Chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. Refer to Other Information on page 71 , in Note 1 6 , Investments and Advances, for further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party. Litigation and Other Contingencies  MTBE Information related to methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) matters is included on page 71 in Note 1 7 under the heading MTBE. Ecuador  Information related to Ecuador matters is included in Note 1 7 under the heading Ecuador, beginning on page 71 . Environmental  The following table displays the annual changes to the companys before-tax environmental remediation reserves, including those for federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws. ##TABLE_START Millions of dollars   Balance at January 1 $ 1,467  $ 1,578  $ 1,683 Net Additions   Expenditures (361 )  (371 )  (470 ) Balance at December 31 $ 1,429  $ 1,467  $ 1,578 ##TABLE_ENDThe company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated. These asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues. The liability balance of approximately $14.2 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2017 related primarily to upstream properties. For the companys other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation. Refer to the discussion below for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company's 2017 environmental expenditures. Refer to Note 2 5 on page 88 for additional discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. Refer also to Note 2 6 on page 89 for additional discussion of the company's asset retirement obligations. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Suspended Wells Information related to suspended wells is included in Note 2 1 , Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells, beginning on page 80 . Income Taxes Information related to income tax contingencies is included on pages 75 through 78 in Note 1 8 and page 87 in Note 2 5 under the heading Income Taxes. Other Contingencies  Information related to other contingencies is included on page 89 in Note 2 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading Other Contingencies. Environmental Matters The company is subject to various international, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and market-based programs. These laws, regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. For example, international agreements and national, regional, and state legislation (e.g., California AB32, SB32 and AB398) and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. Consideration of GHG issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the companys strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the companys long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. In addition, legislation and regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve at the national, state and local levels. Refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 19 through 22 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the companys results of operations or financial condition. Most of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to: prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants into the environment; remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials; or comply with new environmental laws or regulations. Although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse effect on the company's liquidity or financial position. Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. The company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. An obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards. Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2017 at approximately $2.0 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately $0.5 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.5 billion of costs associated with the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the abandonment and restoration of sites. For 2018 , total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $0.5 billion . These capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. Such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are based on managements experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. The discussion in this section of critical accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), wherein: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_START 1. the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters, or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2. the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the companys financial condition or operating performance is material. ##TABLE_END The development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed critical, and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows: Oil and Gas Reserves Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron's estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development and production costs. The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron's Consolidated Financial Statements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following: ##TABLE_START 1. Amortization - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOP basis using total proved reserves. During 2017 , Chevron's UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DDA) for oil and gas properties was $14.8 billion , and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2017 were 6.2 billion barrels for consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties, UOP DDA in 2017 would have increased by approximately $800 million . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2. Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. Proved reserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. For a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments, see Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates below. ##TABLE_END Refer to Table V, Reserve Quantity Information, beginning on page 95 , for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ended December 31, 2017 , and to Table VII, Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves on page 101 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31, 2017 . This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1, beginning on page 57 , which includes a description of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities. Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates The company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PPE) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value. Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the companys business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 24 on page 87 and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" beginning on page 57 . The company routinely performs impairment reviews when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company's crude oil or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed of. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets associated carrying values. Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the companys carrying value. When this occurs, a determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable. No individually material impairments of PPE or Investments were recorded for the year 2017. The company reported impairments for certain oil and gas properties during 2016 due to reservoir performance and lower crude oil prices. The company reported impairments for certain oil and gas properties during 2015 primarily as a result of downward revisions in the company's longer-term crude oil price outlook. The impairments for the years 2016 and 2015 were primarily in Brazil and the United States. A sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the companys PPE and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets. Asset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2017 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 2 6 on page 89 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans  Note 2 3 , beginning on page 82 , includes information on the funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions. The determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. Critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. Information related to the companys processes to develop these assumptions is included on page 84 in Note 2 3 under the relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in the world's financial markets. For 2017 , the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 4.2 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 3.0 percent for U.S. pension plans. The actual return for 2017 was 15.7 percent . For the 10 years ending December 31, 2017 , actual asset returns averaged 5.2 percent for the plan. Additionally, with the exception of three years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 6.75 percent during each year. Total pension expense for 2017 was $1.2 billion . An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the companys primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 61 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2017  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations by approximately $79 million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2017 by approximately $305 million. The aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2017 , was a net liability of approximately $4.4 billion . An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2017 , the company used a discount rate of 3.5 percent to measure the obligations for the U.S. pension plans. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the companys primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 62 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $478 million, and would have decreased the plans underfunded status from approximately $2.0 billion to $1.5 billion. For the companys OPEB plans, expense for 2017 was $94 million , and the total liability, all unfunded at the end of 2017 , was $2.8 billion . For the main U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a discount rate for service cost of 4.6 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 3.4 percent to measure expense in 2017 , and a 3.6 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at December 31, 2017 . Discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis, resulted in an immaterial impact on 2017 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2017 . For information on the sensitivity of the health care cost-trend rate, refer to page 84 in Note 2 3 under the heading Other Benefit Assumptions. Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page 84 in Note 2 3 for a description of the method used to amortize the $5.5 billion of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2017 , and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2018 . In addition, information related to company contributions is included on page 86 in Note 2 3 under the heading Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments. Contingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology. Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as Operating expenses or Selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is more likely than not (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 2 5 beginning on page 87 . Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31, 2017 . An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.

The statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and fairly represent the transactions and financial position of the company. The financial statements include amounts that are based on managements best estimates and judgments. As stated in its report included herein, the independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the companys consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Board of Directors of Chevron has an Audit Committee composed of directors who are not officers or employees of the company. The Audit Committee meets regularly with members of management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm to review accounting, internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters. Both the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm have free and direct access to the Audit Committee without the presence of management. The company's management has evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2017. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the company's disclosure controls are effective in ensuring that information required to be recorded, processed, summarized and reported, are done within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.      Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   The companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this evaluation, the companys management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017. The effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report included herein.          /s/ MICHAEL K.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016  and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013)  issued by the COSO.   Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated  financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.   Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   /s/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP   San Francisco, California   February 22, 2018   We have served as the Companys auditor since 1935.   ##TABLE_ENDConsolidated Statement of Income  Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts ##TABLE_START            Year ended December 31          Revenues and Other Income         Sales and other operating revenues * $ 134,674   $ 110,215  $ 129,925   Income from equity affiliates 4,438   2,661  4,684   Other income 2,610   1,596  3,868   Total Revenues and Other Income 141,722   114,472 138,477   Costs and Other Deductions         Purchased crude oil and products 75,765   59,321  69,751   Operating expenses 19,437   20,268  23,034   Selling, general and administrative expenses 4,448   4,684  4,443   Exploration expenses   1,033  3,340   Depreciation, depletion and amortization 19,349  19,457 21,037   Taxes other than on income * 12,331   11,668  12,030   Interest and debt expense       Total Costs and Other Deductions 132,501   116,632  133,635   Income (Loss) Before Income Tax Expense 9,221   (2,160 )  4,842   Income Tax Expense (Benefit) (48 )   (1,729 )    Net Income (Loss) 9,269   (431 )  4,710   Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests      Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation $ 9,195   $ (497 )  $ 4,587   Per Share of Common Stock         Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation         - Basic $ 4.88   $ (0.27 )  $ 2.46   - Diluted $ 4.85   $ (0.27 )  $ 2.45   * Includes excise, value-added and similar taxes. $ 7,189   $ 6,905  $ 7,359   See accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.                 ##TABLE_ENDConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income Millions of dollars  ##TABLE_START   Year ended December 31           Net Income (Loss) $ 9,269   $ (431 )   $ 4,710   Currency translation adjustment          Unrealized net change arising during period   (22 )   (44 )   Unrealized holding (loss) gain on securities          Net (loss) gain arising during period (3 )     (21 )   Defined benefit plans          Actuarial gain (loss)          Amortization to net income of net actuarial loss and settlements       Actuarial (loss) gain arising during period (571 )   (315 )     Prior service credits (cost)          Amortization to net income of net prior service costs and curtailments (20 )       Prior service (costs) credits arising during period (1 )       Defined benefit plans sponsored by equity affiliates - benefit (cost)   (19 )     Income (taxes) benefit on defined benefit plans (44 )   (505 )   (336 )   Total       Other Comprehensive Gain, Net of Tax       Comprehensive Income 9,523     5,278   Comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests (74 )   (66 )   (123 )   Comprehensive Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation $ 9,449   $ (49 )   $ 5,155   See accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.               ##TABLE_ENDConsolidated Balance Sheet Millions of dollars, except per-share amount ##TABLE_START   At December 31        Assets      Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,813  $ 6,988   Marketable securities    Accounts and notes receivable (less allowance: 2017 - $490;

These require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur. Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percent-owned and any variable-interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. As part of that accounting, the company recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in changes in the companys proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliates equity currently in income. Investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the companys carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial performance, and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value. The new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Differences between the companys carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the companys analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the companys share of the affiliates reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliates historical book values. Fair Value Measurements  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market. Derivatives  The majority of the companys activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivative instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the companys commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the companys fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet. Short-Term Investments All short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in highly liquid debt securities. Those investments that are part of the companys cash management portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as Cash equivalents. Bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days are reported as Time deposits. The balance of short-term investments is reported as Marketable securities and is marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses included in Other comprehensive income. Inventories  Crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market. Materials, supplies and other inventories are primarily stated at net realizable value. Properties, Plant and Equipment  The successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts properties, and related asset retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. All other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note 2 1 , beginning on page 80 , for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs. Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market value of an asset (including changes to the commodity price forecast), significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas properties, the company performs impairment reviews on a country, concession, PSC, development area or field basis, as appropriate. In Downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Refer to Note 10 , beginning on page 64 , relating to fair value measurements. The fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note 2 6 , on page 89 , relating to AROs. Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Impairments of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed. The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized leased assets. Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as Other income. Expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized. Goodwill Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. The company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually at December 31, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized. Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an ARO is made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Refer to Note 2 6 , on page 89 , for a discussion of the companys AROs. For federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares. The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the companys best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the companys own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Currency Translation The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the companys consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in Currency translation adjustment on the Consolidated Statement of Equity. Revenue Recognition Revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemicals products, and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the customer, net of royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. Revenues from natural gas production from properties in which Chevron has an interest with other producers are generally recognized using the entitlement method. Excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer are presented on a gross basis. The associated amounts are shown as a footnote to the Consolidated Statement of Income, on page 52 . Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in Purchased crude oil and products on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation  The company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to certain employees. For equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. The company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period in which an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. The companys Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards include stock options and stock appreciation rights, which have graded vesting provisions by which one-third of each award vests on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. In addition, performance shares granted under the company's LTIP will vest at the end of the three -year performance period. For awards granted under the company's LTIP beginning in 2017, stock options and stock appreciation rights have graded vesting by which one third of each award vests annually on each January 31 on or after the first anniversary of the grant date.

The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows excludes changes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet that did not affect cash. In 2017, an approximate $400 increase in Deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations and a corresponding increase to Properties, plant and equipment, at cost were considered non-cash transactions and excluded from Net increase in operating working capital and Capital expenditures. The amount is related to upstream operating agreements outside of the United States.

The standard provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for contracts with customers, eliminates most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance, and expands disclosure requirements. The company has elected to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective transition method. \"Sales and Other Operating Revenues on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes excise, value-added and similar taxes on sales transactions. Upon adoption of the standard, revenue will exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties, which will have no impact to earnings. The company completed its accounting policy and system enhancements necessary to meet the standard's requirements. The company does not expect the implementation of the standard to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Leases (Topic 842)  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which becomes effective for the company January 1, 2019. The standard requires that lessees present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The company's implementation efforts are focused on accounting policy and disclosure updates and system enhancements necessary to meet the standard's requirements. The company is evaluating the effect of the standard on the companys consolidated financial statements. Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which becomes effective for the company beginning January 1, 2020. The standard requires companies to use forward-looking information to calculate credit loss estimates. The company is evaluating the effect of the standard on the companys consolidated financial statements. Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)  In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04. The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment, and the company has chosen to early adopt beginning January 1, 2017. Early adoption has no effect on the company's consolidated financial statements. Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20)  In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-05, which becomes effective for the company January 1, 2018. The standard provides clarification regarding Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts the guidance on accounting for the derecognition of nonfinancial assets. The company does not expect the implementation of the standard to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)  In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, which becomes effective for the company January 1, 2018. The standard requires the disaggregation of the service cost component from the other components of net periodic benefit cost and allows only the service cost component of net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization. The company does not expect the implementation of the standard to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, which becomes effective for the company January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. The standard provides clarification on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified on the statement of cash flows. The company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Restricted Cash In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, which becomes effective for the company January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. The standard requires an entity to explain the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows and to provide a reconciliation to the balance sheet when the cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are not separately presented or are presented in more than one line item on the balance sheet. Upon adoption, the companys restricted cash balances will be included in the beginning and ending balances on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Note 6  Lease Commitments Certain noncancellable leases are classified as capital leases, and the leased assets are included as part of Properties, plant and equipment, at cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Such leasing arrangements involve crude oil production and processing equipment, service stations, bareboat charters, office buildings, and other facilities. Other leases are classified as operating leases and are not capitalized. The payments on operating leases are recorded as expense.

Marketable Securities The company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2017 . Derivatives  The company records its derivative instruments  other than any commodity derivative contracts that are designated as normal purchase and normal sale  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts principally with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. The company does not materially adjust this information. Properties, Plant and Equipment The company did not have any individually material impairments in 2017. The company reported impairments for certain oil and gas properties during 2016 primarily due to reservoir performance and lower crude oil prices. The impairments in 2016 were primarily in Brazil and the United States.

Cash and cash equivalents had carrying/fair values of $4,813 and $6,988 at December 31, 2017 , and December 31, 2016 , respectively. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 and reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were settled at December 31, 2017 . \"Cash and cash equivalents do not include investments with a carrying/fair value of $1,130 and $1,426 at December 31, 2017 , and December 31, 2016 , respectively. At December 31, 2017 , these investments are classified as Level 1 and include restricted funds related to certain upstream abandonment activities, tax payments and refundable deposits related to pending asset sales, which are reported in Deferred charges and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Long-term debt of $23,477 and $26,193 at December 31, 2017 , and December 31, 2016 , respectively, had estimated fair values of $23,943 and $26,627 , respectively. Long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued bonds. The fair value of corporate bonds is $23,245 and classified as Level 1. The fair value of other long-term debt is $698 and classified as Level 2. The carrying values of short-term financial assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values. Fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , were not material. Note 11 Financial and Derivative Instruments Derivative Commodity Instruments The companys derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas and refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. None of the companys derivative instruments is designated as a hedging instrument, although certain of the companys affiliates make such designation. The companys derivatives are not material to the companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity derivative activities. The company uses derivative commodity instruments traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic platforms of the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, the company enters into swap contracts and option contracts principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the over-the-counter markets, which are governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements and other master netting arrangements. Depending on the nature of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required.

Amounts not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet represent positions that do not meet all the conditions for \"a right of offset.\" Concentrations of Credit Risk The companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The companys short-term investments are placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. Company investment policies limit the companys exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk. Similar policies on diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the companys counterparties in derivative instruments. The trade receivable balances, reflecting the companys diversified sources of revenue, are dispersed among the companys broad customer base worldwide. As a result, the company believes concentrations of credit risk are limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring pre-payments, letters of credit or other acceptable collateral instruments to support sales to customers. Note 12  Assets Held for Sale At December 31, 2017 , the company classified $640 of net properties, plant and equipment as Assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets are primarily associated with downstream and upstream operations that are anticipated to be sold in the next 12 months. The revenues and earnings contributions of these assets in 2017 were not material. Note 13  Equity Retained earnings at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , included approximately $18,473 and $16,479 , respectively, for the companys share of undistributed earnings of equity affiliates. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts At December 31, 2017 , about 82 million shares of Chevrons common stock remained available for issuance from the 260 million shares that were reserved for issuance under the Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan. In addition, 800,468 shares remain available for issuance from the 1,600,000 shares of the companys common stock that were reserved for awards under the Chevron Corporation Non-Employee Directors Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan. Note 14  Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share (EPS) is based upon Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation (earnings) and includes the effects of deferrals of salary and other compensation awards that are invested in Chevron stock units by certain officers and employees of the company. Diluted EPS includes the effects of these items as well as the dilutive effects of outstanding stock options awarded under the companys stock option programs (refer to Note 2 2 , Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation, beginning on page 81 ).

The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the companys reportable segments and operating segments. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies. The companys segments are managed by segment managers who report to the chief operating decision maker (CODM). The segments represent components of the company that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available. The companys primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile. Other components of the companys operations are reported as \"International (outside the United States). Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Segment Earnings  The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis.

At December 31, 2017 , the companys carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $130 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCOs net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCOs net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project with a balance of $2,060 , including accrued interest. See Note 8 , on page 63 , for summarized financial information for 100 percent of TCO. Petropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the Hamaca heavy-oil production and upgrading project in Venezuelas Orinoco Belt. At December 31, 2017 , the companys carrying value of its investment in Petropiar was approximately $145 less than the amount of underlying equity in Petropiars net assets. The difference represents the excess of Chevrons underlying equity in Petropiars net assets over the net book value of the assets contributed to the venture. Caspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, a variable interest entity, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak. The company has investments and advances totaling $1,151 , which includes long-term loans of $727 at year-end 2017 . The loans were provided to fund 30 percent of the initial pipeline construction. The company is not the primary beneficiary of the consortium because it does not direct activities of the consortium and only receives its proportionate share of the financial returns. Petroboscan Chevron has a 39.2 percent interest in Petroboscan, a joint stock company which operates the Boscan Field in Venezuela. At December 31, 2017 , the companys carrying value of its investment in Petroboscan was approximately $105 higher than the amount of underlying equity in Petroboscans net assets. The difference reflects the excess of the net book value of the assets contributed by Chevron over its underlying equity in Petroboscans net assets. The company also has an outstanding long-term loan to Petroboscan of $686 at year-end 2017 . Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Angola LNG Limited  Chevron has a 36.4 percent interest in Angola LNG Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets. GS Caltex Corporation  Chevron owns 50 percent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy. The joint venture imports, refines and markets petroleum products, petrochemicals and lubricants, predominantly in South Korea. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. The other half is owned by Phillips 66. Other Information Sales and other operating revenues on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes $8,165 , $5,786 and $4,850 with affiliated companies for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Purchased crude oil and products includes $4,800 , $3,468 and $4,240 with affiliated companies for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

The following table provides summarized financial information on a 100 percent basis for all equity affiliates as well as Chevrons total share, which includes Chevron's net loans to affiliates of $3,853 , $3,535 and $410 at December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. ##TABLE_START  Affiliates    Chevron Share  Year ended December 31       Total revenues $ 70,744  $ 59,253  $ 71,389   $ 33,460  $ 27,787  $ 33,492 Income before income tax expense 13,487  6,587  13,129   5,712  3,670  6,279 Net income attributable to affiliates 10,751  5,127  10,649   4,468  2,876  4,691 At December 31             Current assets $ 33,883  $ 33,406  $ 27,162   $ 13,568  $ 13,743  $ 10,657 Noncurrent assets 82,261  75,258  71,650   32,643  28,854  26,607 Current liabilities 26,873  24,793  20,559   10,201  8,996  7,351 Noncurrent liabilities 21,447  22,671  18,560   4,224  4,255  3,909 Total affiliates' net equity $ 67,824  $ 61,200  $ 59,693   $ 31,786  $ 29,346  $ 26,004 ##TABLE_ENDNote 17  Litigation MTBE Chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. Chevron is a party to eight pending lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. Resolution of these lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. Additional lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future. The companys ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable. The company no longer uses MTBE in the manufacture of gasoline in the United States. Ecuador  Background Chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit initiated in the Superior Court of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, in May 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. The lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. Until 1992, Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of this consortium with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by Petroecuador. At the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the concession area, Texpet entered into a formal agreement with the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador for Texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to Texpets ownership share of the consortium. Pursuant to that agreement, Texpet conducted a three -year remediation program at a cost of $40 . After certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the government granted Texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations. Based on the history described above, Chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit. As to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction over Chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to Texpet by the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and municipal governments. With regard to the facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms that Texpets remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects Petroecuadors failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and Petroecuadors further conduct since assuming full control over the operations. Lago Agrio Judgment  In 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending that the court assess $18,900 , which would, according to the engineer, provide financial compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other items, environmental remediation, health care systems and additional infrastructure for Petroecuador. The engineers report also asserted that an additional $8,400 could be assessed against Chevron for unjust enrichment. In 2009, following the disclosure by Chevron of evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome, the judge presiding over the case was recused. In 2010, Chevron moved to strike the mining engineers report and to dismiss the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the United States indicating that the report was prepared by consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as the mining engineers independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct. In August 2010, the judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineers report and requiring the parties to provide their positions on damages within 45 days . Chevron subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge, claiming that he had disregarded evidence of fraud and misconduct and that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory time requirement. In September 2010, Chevron submitted its position on damages, asserting that no amount should be assessed against it. The plaintiffs submission, which relied in part on the mining engineers report, took the position that damages are between approximately $16,000 and $76,000 and that unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between approximately $5,000 and $38,000 . The next day, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. Chevron petitioned to have that order declared a nullity in light of Chevrons prior recusal petition, and because procedural and evidentiary matters remained unresolved. In October 2010, Chevrons motion to recuse the judge was granted. A new judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judges order closing the evidentiary phase of the case. On December 17, 2010, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. On February 14, 2011, the provincial court in Lago Agrio rendered an adverse judgment in the case. The court rejected Chevrons defenses to the extent the court addressed them in its opinion. The judgment assessed approximately $8,600 in damages and approximately $900 as an award for the plaintiffs representatives. It also assessed an additional amount of approximately $8,600 in punitive damages unless the company issued a public apology within 15 days of the judgment, which Chevron did not do. On February 17, 2011, the plaintiffs appealed the judgment, seeking increased damages, and on March 11, 2011, Chevron appealed the judgment seeking to have the judgment nullified. On January 3, 2012, an appellate panel in the provincial court affirmed the February 14, 2011 decision and ordered that Chevron pay additional attorneys fees in the amount of  0.10% of the values that are derived from the decisional act of this judgment. The plaintiffs filed a petition to clarify and amplify the appellate decision on January 6, 2012, and the court issued a ruling in response on January 13, 2012, purporting to clarify and amplify its January 3, 2012 ruling, which included clarification that the deadline for the company to issue a public apology to avoid the additional amount of approximately $8,600 in punitive damages was within 15 days of the clarification ruling, or February 3, 2012. Chevron did not issue an apology because doing so might be mischaracterized as an admission of liability and would be contrary to facts and evidence submitted at trial. On January 20, 2012, Chevron appealed (called a petition for cassation) the appellate panels decision to Ecuadors National Court of Justice. As part of the appeal, Chevron requested the suspension of any requirement that Chevron post a bond to prevent enforcement under Ecuadorian law of the judgment during the cassation appeal. On February 17, 2012, the appellate panel of the provincial court admitted Chevrons cassation appeal in a procedural step necessary for the National Court of Justice to hear the appeal. The provincial court appellate panel denied Chevrons request for suspension of the requirement that Chevron post a bond and stated that it would not comply with the First and Second Interim Awards of the international arbitration tribunal discussed below. On March 29, 2012, the matter was transferred from the provincial court to the National Court of Justice, and on November 22, 2012, the National Court agreed to hear Chevron's cassation appeal. On August 3, 2012, the provincial court in Lago Agrio approved a court-appointed liquidators report on damages that calculated the total judgment in the case to be $19,100 . On November 13, 2013, the National Court ratified the judgment but nullified the $8,600 punitive damage assessment, resulting in a judgment of $9,500 . On December 23, 2013, Chevron appealed the decision to the Ecuador Constitutional Court, Ecuador's highest court. The reporting justice of the Constitutional Court heard oral arguments on the appeal on July 16, 2015. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' Enforcement Actions  Chevron has no assets in Ecuador and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' lawyers have stated in press releases and through other media that they will seek to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in various countries and otherwise disrupt Chevron's operations. On May 30, 2012, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs filed an action against Chevron Corporation, Chevron Canada Limited, and Chevron Canada Finance Limited in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada, seeking to recognize and enforce the Ecuadorian judgment. On May 1, 2013, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice held that the Court has jurisdiction over Chevron and Chevron Canada Limited for purposes of the action, but stayed the action due to the absence of evidence that Chevron Corporation has assets in Ontario. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs appealed that decision and on December 17, 2013, the Court of Appeals for Ontario affirmed the lower courts decision on jurisdiction and set aside the stay, allowing the recognition and enforcement action to be heard in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Chevron appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada and, on September 4, 2015, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and affirmed that the Ontario Superior Court of Justice has jurisdiction over Chevron and Chevron Canada Limited for purposes of the action. The recognition and enforcement proceeding and related preliminary motions are proceeding in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. On January 20, 2017, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granted Chevron Canada Limiteds and Chevron Corporations motions for summary judgment, concluding that the two companies are separate legal entities with separate rights and obligations. As a result, the Superior Court dismissed the recognition and enforcement claim against Chevron Canada Limited. Chevron Corporation still remains as a defendant in the action. On February 3, 2017, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs appealed the Superior Court's January 20, 2017 decision. On June 27, 2012, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs filed a complaint against Chevron Corporation in the Superior Court of Justice in Brasilia, Brazil, seeking to recognize and enforce the Ecuadorian judgment. Chevron has answered the complaint. In accordance with Brazilian procedure, the matter was referred to the public prosecutor for a nonbinding opinion of the issues raised in the complaint. On May 13, 2015, the public prosecutor issued its nonbinding opinion and recommended that the Superior Court of Justice reject the plaintiffs' recognition and enforcement request, finding, among other things, that the Lago Agrio judgment was procured through fraud and corruption and cannot be recognized in Brazil because it violates Brazilian and international public order. On November 29, 2017, the Superior Court of Justice issued a decision dismissing the Lago Agrio plaintiffs recognition and enforcement proceeding based on jurisdictional grounds. On October 15, 2012, the provincial court in Lago Agrio issued an ex parte embargo order that purports to order the seizure of assets belonging to separate Chevron subsidiaries in Ecuador, Argentina and Colombia. On November 6, 2012, at the request of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs, a court in Argentina issued a Freeze Order against Chevron Argentina S.R.L. and another Chevron subsidiary, Ingeniero Norberto Priu, requiring shares of both companies to be \"embargoed,\" requiring third parties to withhold 40 percent of any payments due to Chevron Argentina S.R.L. and ordering banks to withhold 40 percent of the funds in Chevron Argentina S.R.L. bank accounts. On December 14, 2012, the Argentinean court rejected a motion to revoke the Freeze Order but modified it by ordering that third parties are not required to withhold funds but must report their payments. The court also clarified that the Freeze Order relating to bank accounts excludes taxes. On January 30, 2013, an appellate court upheld the Freeze Order, but on June 4, 2013 the Supreme Court of Argentina revoked the Freeze Order in its entirety. On December 12, 2013, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs served Chevron with notice of their filing of an enforcement proceeding in the National Court, First Instance, of Argentina. Chevron filed its answer on February 27, 2014, to which the Lago Agrio plaintiffs responded on December 29, 2015. On April 19, 2016, the public prosecutor in Argentina issued a non-binding opinion recommending to the National Court, First Instance, of Argentina that it reject the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' request to recognize the Ecuadorian judgment in Argentina. On February 24, 2017, the public prosecutor in Argentina issued a supplemental opinion reaffirming its previous recommendations. On November 1, 2017, the National Court, First Instance, of Argentina issued a decision dismissing the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' recognition and enforcement proceeding based on jurisdictional grounds. On November 2, 2017, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Federal Civil Court of Appeals. Chevron continues to believe the provincial courts judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable in Ecuador, the United States and other countries. The company also believes the judgment is the product of fraud, and contrary to the legitimate scientific evidence. Chevron cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the appeals process in Ecuador or any enforcement action. Chevron expects to continue a vigorous defense of any imposition of liability in the Ecuadorian courts and to contest and defend any and all enforcement actions. Company's Bilateral Investment Treaty Arbitration Claims  Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim in September 2009 against the Republic of Ecuador before an arbitral tribunal presiding in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague under the Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. The claim alleges violations of the Republic of Ecuadors obligations under the United StatesEcuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) and breaches of the settlement and release agreements between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet (described above), which are investment Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts agreements protected by the BIT. Through the arbitration, Chevron and Texpet are seeking relief against the Republic of Ecuador, including a declaration that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation constitutes a violation of Ecuadors obligations under the BIT. On January 25, 2012, the Tribunal issued its First Interim Measures Award requiring the Republic of Ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case pending further order of the Tribunal. On February 16, 2012, the Tribunal issued a Second Interim Award mandating that the Republic of Ecuador take all measures necessary (whether by its judicial, legislative or executive branches) to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement and recognition within and without Ecuador of the judgment against Chevron. On February 27, 2012, the Tribunal issued a Third Interim Award confirming its jurisdiction to hear Chevron's arbitration claims. On February 7, 2013, the Tribunal issued its Fourth Interim Award in which it declared that the Republic of Ecuador has violated the First and Second Interim Awards under the [BIT], the UNCITRAL Rules and international law in regard to the finalization and enforcement subject to execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment within and outside Ecuador, including (but not limited to) Canada, Brazil and Argentina. The Republic of Ecuador subsequently filed in the District Court of the Hague a request to set aside the Tribunals Interim Awards and the First Partial Award (described below), and on January 20, 2016, the District Court denied the Republic's request. On April 13, 2016, the Republic of Ecuador appealed the decision. On July 18, 2017, the Appeals Court of the Hague denied the Republic's appeal. On October 18, 2017, the Republic appealed the decision of the Appeals Court of the Hague to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands. The Tribunal has divided the merits phase of the proceeding into three phases. On September 17, 2013, the Tribunal issued its First Partial Award from Phase One, finding that the settlement agreements between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet applied to Texpet and Chevron, released Texpet and Chevron from claims based on \"collective\" or \"diffuse\" rights arising from Texpet's operations in the former concession area and precluded third parties from asserting collective/diffuse rights environmental claims relating to Texpet's operations in the former concession area but did not preclude individual claims for personal harm. The Tribunal held a hearing on April 29-30, 2014, to address remaining issues relating to Phase One, and on March 12, 2015, it issued a nonbinding decision that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' complaint, on its face, includes claims not barred by the settlement agreement between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet. In the same decision, the Tribunal deferred to Phase Two remaining issues from Phase One, including whether the Republic of Ecuador breached the 1995 settlement agreement and the remedies that are available to Chevron and Texpet as a result of that breach. Phase Two issues were addressed at a hearing held in April and May 2015. The Tribunal has not set a date for Phase Three, the damages phase of the arbitration. Company's RICO Action  Through a series of U.S. court proceedings initiated by Chevron to obtain discovery relating to the Lago Agrio litigation and the BIT arbitration, Chevron obtained evidence that it believes shows a pattern of fraud, collusion, corruption, and other misconduct on the part of several lawyers, consultants and others acting for the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. In February 2011, Chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters, alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and other state laws. Through the civil lawsuit, Chevron sought relief that included a declaration that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable. The trial commenced on October 15, 2013 and concluded on November 22, 2013. On March 4, 2014, the Federal District Court entered a judgment in favor of Chevron, prohibiting the defendants from seeking to enforce the Lago Agrio judgment in the United States and further prohibiting them from profiting from their illegal acts. The defendants appealed the Federal District Court's decision, and, on April 20, 2015, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard oral arguments. On August 8, 2016, the Second Circuit issued a unanimous opinion affirming in full the judgment of the Federal District Court in favor of Chevron. On October 27, 2016, the Second Circuit denied the defendants' petitions for en banc rehearing of the opinion on their appeal. On March 27, 2017, two of the defendants filed a petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. On June 19, 2017, the United States Supreme Court denied the defendants' petition for a Writ of Certiorari. Management's Assessment The ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on Chevron, remains uncertain. Management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in this case. Due to the defects associated with the Ecuadorian judgment, the 2008 engineers report on alleged damages and the September 2010 plaintiffs submission on alleged damages, management does not believe these documents have any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). Moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).

The 2017 decline in income tax benefit of $1,681 , from a benefit of $1,729 in 2016 to a benefit of $48 in 2017, is a result of the year-over-year increase in total income before income tax expense, which is primarily due to effects of higher crude oil prices and gains on asset sales primarily in Indonesia and Canada. In addition, the tax benefit for the year includes a provisional benefit of $2,020 from U.S. tax reform, which primarily reflects the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. The companys effective tax rate changed from 80 percent in 2016 to (0.5) percent in 2017 . The change in effective tax rate is primarily a consequence of the mix effect resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions and the 2017 impact of U.S. tax reform. As noted above, U.S. tax reform resulted in the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. The final impact will not be known until the actual 2017 U.S. tax return is submitted in 2018, and this may result in a change to the provisional amounts that have been recognized. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts The company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis. The reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following: ##TABLE_START     At December 31    Deferred tax liabilities     Properties, plant and equipment $ 19,869   $ 25,180 Investments and other 4,796   5,222 Total deferred tax liabilities 24,665   30,402 Deferred tax assets     Foreign tax credits (11,872 )   (10,976 ) Asset retirement obligations/environmental reserves (5,511 )   (6,251 ) Employee benefits (3,129 )   (4,392 ) Deferred credits (1,769 )   (1,950 ) Tax loss carryforwards (5,463 )   (6,030 ) Other accrued liabilities (842 )   (510 ) Inventory (336 )   (374 ) Miscellaneous (2,415 )   (3,121 ) Total deferred tax assets (31,337 )   (33,604 ) Deferred tax assets valuation allowance 16,574   16,069 Total deferred taxes, net $ 9,902   $ 12,867 ##TABLE_ENDDeferred tax liabilities at the end of 2017 decreased by approximately $5,700 from year-end 2016 . The decrease was primarily related to property, plant and equipment temporary differences mainly due to the change in the enacted U.S. tax rate. Deferred tax assets decreased by approximately $2,300 in 2017. Decreases were mainly due to the change in the enacted U.S. tax rate and primarily impacted asset retirement obligations, employee benefits and tax loss carry forwards. The decrease was partially reduced by an increase in foreign tax credits arising from earnings in high-tax rate international jurisdictions, which was substantially offset by valuation allowances. The overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. It reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in managements assessment, more likely than not to be realized. At the end of 2017 , the company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately $16,102 and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,379 , primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2018 through 2034 . U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $11,872 will expire between 2018 and 2027 . At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , deferred taxes were classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: ##TABLE_START  At December 31     Deferred charges and other assets $ (4,750 )   $ (4,649 ) Noncurrent deferred income taxes 14,652   17,516 Total deferred income taxes, net $ 9,902   $ 12,867 ##TABLE_ENDEnactment of U.S. tax reform imposed a one-time U.S. federal tax on the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings indefinitely reinvested abroad, which did not have a material impact on the companys financial results. The indefinite reinvestment assertion continues to apply for the purpose of determining deferred tax liabilities for U.S. state and foreign withholding tax purposes. U.S. state and foreign withholding taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately $57,300 at December 31, 2017 . This amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the companys ongoing international business. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of state and foreign taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. The company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. Uncertain Income Tax Positions The company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if managements assessment is that the position is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent ) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term tax position in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts The following table indicates the changes to the companys unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . The term unrecognized tax benefits in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements. Interest and penalties are not included. ##TABLE_START     Balance at January 1 $ 3,031   $ 3,042  $ 3,552 Foreign currency effects    (27 ) Additions based on tax positions taken in current year 1,853    Additions for tax positions taken in prior years 1,166    Reductions for tax positions taken in prior years (90 )   (390 )  (678 ) Settlements with taxing authorities in current year (1,173 )   (36 )  (5 ) Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations (2 )   (12 )  (172 ) Balance at December 31 $ 4,828   $ 3,031  $ 3,042 ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in unrecognized tax benefits between December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017 was primarily due to foreign tax credits associated with the deemed repatriation. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to these foreign tax credits had no impact on the effective tax rate since the change to the deferred tax asset was fully offset with a change to the valuation allowance. The resolution of numerous issues with various tax jurisdictions during the year also impacted the movement from December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. Approximately 81 percent of the $4,828 of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017 , would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized. Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition. Tax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. For the companys major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31, 2017 . For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows: United States  2011 , Nigeria  2000 , Australia  2006 , Angola  2016 and Kazakhstan  2007 . The company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions. Both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the companys total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits. On April 21, 2017, an adverse decision was issued by the full Federal Court on Australia regarding the interest rate to be applied on certain Chevron intercompany loans. On August 14, 2017, an agreement was reached with the Australian Taxation Office to settle this dispute. Management believes the agreed terms to be a reasonable resolution of the dispute, which did not have a material impact on the 2017 results of the company. On the Consolidated Statement of Income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as Income tax expense. As of December 31, 2017 , accruals of $178 for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared with accruals of $424 as of year-end 2016 . Income tax expense (benefit) associated with interest and penalties was $(161) , $38 and $195 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

The company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. At December 31, 2017 , the company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt. At December 31, 2017 , the company had $10,000 in committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The credit facilities consist of a 364 -day facility which enables borrowing of up to $9,575 and allows the company to convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, and a $425  five -year facility expiring in December 2020 . These facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The companys practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the companys strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2017 . The company classified $10,000 and $9,000 of short-term debt as long-term at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, and the company has both the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Note 21  Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells  The company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well, and (b) the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either condition is not met or if the company obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense. The following table indicates the changes to the companys suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended December 31, 2017 : ##TABLE_START  2016 Beginning balance at January 1 $ 3,540 $ 3,312 $ 4,195 Additions to capitalized exploratory well costs pending the determination of proved reserves 465 Reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment based on the determination of proved reserves (113 ) (119 ) (164 ) Capitalized exploratory well costs charged to expense (39 ) (118 ) (1,397 ) Other reductions * (9 )  (191 ) Ending balance at December 31 $ 3,702 $ 3,540 $ 3,312 ##TABLE_END* Represents property sales. The following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling. ##TABLE_START  At December 31   2016 Exploratory well costs capitalized for a period of one year or less $ $ $ Exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year 3,395 3,095 2,823 Balance at December 31 $ 3,702 $ 3,540 $ 3,312 Number of projects with exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year * 35 ##TABLE_END* Certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both. Of the $3,395 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31, 2017 , $2,257 ( 17 projects) is related to projects that had drilling activities underway or firmly planned for the near future. The $1,138 balance is related to 15 projects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not underway or firmly planned for the near future. Additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development. The projects for the $1,138 referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects economic viability: (a) $190 ( two projects)  undergoing front-end engineering and design with final investment decision expected within four years ; (b) $99 ( one project)  development concept under review by government; (c) $826 ( seven projects)  development alternatives under review; (d) $23 ( five projects)  miscellaneous activities for projects with smaller amounts suspended. While progress was being made on all 32 projects, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations associated with the projects. More than half of these decisions are expected to occur in the next five years . The $3,395 of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of December 31, 2017 , represents 158 exploratory wells in 32 projects. The tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project basis: ##TABLE_START Aging based on drilling completion date of individual wells: Amount   Number of wells 1998-2006 $   2007-2011   2012-2016 2,198   Total $ 3,395        Aging based on drilling completion date of last suspended well in project: Amount   Number of projects 2003-2009 $   2010-2013   2014-2017 2,684   Total $ 3,395   ##TABLE_ENDNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Note 22  Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation Compensation expense for stock options for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $137 ( $89 after tax), $271 ( $176 after tax) and $312 ( $203 after tax), respectively. In addition, compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares and restricted stock units was $231 ( $150 after tax), $371 ( $241 after tax) and $32 ( $21 after tax) for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. No significant stock-based compensation cost was capitalized at December 31, 2017 , or December 31, 2016 . Cash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $1,100 , $647 and $195 , respectively. Actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from option exercises were $48 , $21 and $17 for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Cash paid to settle performance shares and stock appreciation rights was $187 , $82 and $104 for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Awards under the Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and nonstock grants. From April 2004 through May 2023, no more than 260 million shares may be issued under the LTIP. For awards issued on or after May 29, 2013, no more than 50 million of those shares may be in a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for shares by the award recipient. For the major types of awards issued before January 1, 2017, the contractual terms vary between three years for the performance shares and restricted stock units, and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights. For awards issued after January 1, 2017, contractual terms vary between three years for the performance shares and special restricted stock units, 5 years for standard restricted stock units and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights. Forfeitures for performance shares, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights are recognized as they occur. Forfeitures for stock options are estimated using historical forfeiture data dating back to 1990. The fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted-average assumptions: ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31      Expected term in years 1 6.3 6.3 6.1 Volatility 2 21.7 % 21.7 % 21.9 % Risk-free interest rate based on zero coupon U.S. treasury note 2.2 % 1.6 % 1.4 % Dividend yield 4.2 % 4.5 % 3.6 % Weighted-average fair value per option granted $ 15.31 $ 9.53 $ 13.89 ##TABLE_END1 Expected term is based on historical exercise and postvesting cancellation data. 2 Volatility rate is based on historical stock prices over an appropriate period, generally equal to the expected term.

As of December 31, 2017 , there was $88 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years. At January 1, 2017 , the number of LTIP performance shares outstanding was equivalent to 2,393,428 shares. During 2017 , 1,623,526 performance shares were granted, 708,192 shares vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 217,969 shares were forfeited. At December 31, 2017 , performance shares outstanding were 3,090,793 . The fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was $340 , and was measured using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts At January 1, 2017, the number of restricted stock units outstanding was equivalent to 557,415 shares. During 2017, 892,991 restricted stock units were granted, 96,210 units vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 117,696 units were forfeited. At December 31, 2017, restricted stock units outstanding were 1,236,500 .

In addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights that were granted under LTIP totaled approximately 4.6 million equivalent shares as of December 31, 2017 . The fair value of the liability recorded for the vested portion of these instruments was $115 . Note 23  Employee Benefit Plans  The company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States, all qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the companys other investment alternatives. The company also sponsors other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. Beginning in 2017, medical coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees in the companys main U.S. medical plan is provided through a third-party private exchange. The increase to the pre-Medicare company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company. The company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The funded status of the companys pension and OPEB plans for 2017 and 2016 follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits          Other Benefits   U.S.  Intl.   U.S.  Intl.

These amortization periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to receive Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts benefits under the plans. These losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10 percent of the higher of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. The amount subject to amortization is determined on a plan-by-plan basis. During 2018 , the company estimates actuarial losses of $303 , $30 and $15 will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss for U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans, respectively. In addition, the company estimates an additional $334 will be recognized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss during 2018 related to lump-sum settlement costs from the main U.S. pension plans. The weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs (credits) recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2017 , was approximately 5 and 9 years for U.S. and international pension plans, respectively, and 9 years for OPEB plans. During 2018 , the company estimates prior service (credits) costs of $2 , $11 and $(28) will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss for U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans, respectively. Assumptions The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits                    Other Benefits   U.S. Intl.   U.S. Intl.  U.S. Intl.     Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations:                 Discount rate 3.5 % 3.9 %   3.9 % 4.3 %  4.0 % 5.3 %  3.8 %   4.3 %  4.6 % Rate of compensation increase 4.5 % 4.0 %   4.5 % 4.5 %  4.5 % 4.8 %  N/A   N/A  N/A Assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost:                 Discount rate for service cost 4.2 % 4.3 %   4.4 % 5.3 %  3.7 % 5.0 %  4.6 %   4.9 %  4.3 % Discount rate for interest cost 3.0 % 4.3 %   3.0 % 5.3 %  3.7 % 5.0 %  3.8 %   4.0 %  4.3 % Expected return on plan assets 6.8 % 5.5 %   7.3 % 6.3 %  7.5 % 6.3 %  N/A   N/A  N/A Rate of compensation increase 4.5 % 4.5 %   4.5 % 4.8 %  4.5 % 5.1 %  N/A   N/A  N/A ##TABLE_ENDExpected Return on Plan Assets The companys estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the companys estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies. For 2017 , the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent for U.S. pension plan assets, which account for 68 percent of the companys pension plan assets. In 2016 , the company used a long-term rate of return of 7.25 percent for this plan, and in 2015 , 7.50 percent . The market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the three -month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense. Discount Rate The discount rate assumptions used to determine the U.S. and international pension and OPEB plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis. This analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company's plans and the yields on high-quality bonds. The projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The effective discount rates derived from this analysis at the end of 2017 were 3.5 percent for the main U.S. pension plan and 3.6 percent for the main U.S. OPEB plan. The discount rates for these plans at the end of 2016 were 3.9 and 4.1 percent , respectively, while in 2015 they were 4.0 and 4.5 percent for these plans, respectively. Beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost associated with the company's main U.S. pension and OPEB plans. Under the new method, these costs are estimated by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. In prior years, the service and interest costs were estimated utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the defined benefit obligations at the beginning of the year. Other Benefit Assumptions Assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for retiree health care costs. For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2017 , for the main U.S. OPEB plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 7.4 percent in 2018 and gradually decline to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. For this measurement at December 31, 2016 , the assumed health care cost-trend rates Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts started with 6.9 percent in 2017 and gradually declined to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. The annual increase to the company's pre-Medicare medical contributions for the main U.S. plan upon retirement is capped at 4 percent . A 1-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost-trend rates would have the following effects on worldwide plans: ##TABLE_START  1 Percent Increase  1 Percent Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components $  $ (10 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $  $ (155 ) ##TABLE_ENDPlan Assets and Investment Strategy  The fair value measurements of the companys pension plans for 2017 and 2016 are below: ##TABLE_START  U.S.    Intl.

The companys U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise 90 percent of the total pension assets. Both the U.S. and U.K. plans have an Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. To assess the plans investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established. For the primary U.S. pension plan, the company's Benefit Plan Investment Committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges: Equities 30  60 percent , Fixed Income and Cash 20  65 percent , Real Estate 0  15 percent , and Alternative Investments 0  15 percent . For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board of Trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines: Equities 30  50 percent, Fixed Income and Cash 35  70 percent , and Real Estate 5  15 percent. The other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan. Actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors, including market conditions and illiquidity constraints. To mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds. The company does not prefund its OPEB obligations. Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments In 2017 , the company contributed $728 and $252 to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. In 2018 , the company expects contributions to be approximately $700 to its U.S. plans and $250 to its international pension plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments, tax law changes and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations. The company anticipates paying OPEB benefits of approximately $174 in 2018 ; $151 was paid in 2017 . The following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be paid by the company in the next 10 years: ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits   Other  U.S.  Intl.

Compensation expense for the ESIP totaled $316 , $281 and $316 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Benefit Plan Trusts Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. At year-end 2017 , the trust contained 14.2 million shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. The company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trusts beneficiaries. The shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations. Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , trust assets of $35 and $35 , respectively, were invested primarily in interest-earning accounts. Employee Incentive Plans The Chevron Incentive Plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to corporate, business unit and individual performance in the prior year. Charges to expense for cash bonuses were $936 , $662 and $690 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

These liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated. Refer to Note 1 8 , beginning on page 75 , for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the companys major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. As discussed in Note 1 8 , beginning on page 75 , the company received an adverse decision on April 21, 2017, regarding the interest rate to be applied on certain Chevron intercompany loans. On August 14, 2017, an agreement was reached with the Australian Taxation Office to settle this dispute. Management believes the agreed terms to be a reasonable resolution of the dispute, which did not have a material impact on the 2017 results of the company. Settlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for income and franchise taxes for all years under examination or subject to future examination. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Guarantees  The company has two guarantees to equity affiliates totaling $1,082 . Of this amount, $712 is associated with a financing arrangement with an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 4 -year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum amount will be reduced as payments are made by the affiliate. The remaining amount of $370 is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 10 -year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for either guarantee. Indemnifications In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200 , which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200 obligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when the indemnification expires. The environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997. Although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements  The company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the companys business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2018  $1,402 ; 2019  $1,367 ; 2020  $1,027 ; 2021  $920 ; 2022  $555 ; 2023 and after  $2,566 . A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately $1,300 in 2017 , $1,300 in 2016 and $1,900 in 2015 . Environmental The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including MTBE, by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various operating, closed and divested sites, including, but not limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, chemical plants, marketing facilities, crude oil fields, and mining sites. Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities. The amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. These future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, but the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Chevrons environmental reserve as of December 31, 2017 , was $1,429 . Included in this balance was $269 related to remediation activities at approximately 146 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal Superfund law or analogous state laws which provide for joint and several liability for all responsible parties. Any future actions by regulatory agencies to require Chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the companys results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. Of the remaining year-end 2017 environmental reserves balance of $1,160 , $781 is related to the companys U.S. downstream operations, $38 to its international downstream operations, $340 to upstream operations and $1 to other businesses. Liabilities at all sites were primarily associated with the companys plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the United States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state and local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2017 had a recorded liability that was material to the companys results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. Refer to Note 2 6 on page 89 for a discussion of the companys asset retirement obligations. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Other Contingencies  Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; joint venture partners; U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; suppliers; and individuals. The amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve, and may result in gains or losses in future periods. The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or together, may result in significant gains or losses in future periods. Note 26  Asset Retirement Obligations The company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) as an asset and liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or method of settlement that may be beyond the companys control. This uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value. Recognition of the ARO includes: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, (2) the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates. AROs are primarily recorded for the companys crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews of its downstream long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation. The following table indicates the changes to the companys before-tax asset retirement obligations in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 : ##TABLE_START     Balance at January 1 $ 14,243   $ 15,642  $ 15,053 Liabilities incurred    Liabilities settled (1,721 )   (1,658 )  (981 ) Accretion expense    Revisions in estimated cash flows   (694 )  Balance at December 31 $ 14,214   $ 14,243  $ 15,642 ##TABLE_ENDIn the table above, the amount associated with \"Revisions in estimated cash flows\" in 2017 reflects increased cost estimates to  abandon wells, equipment and facilities. The long-term portion of the $14,214 balance at the end of 2017 was $13,228 . Note 27  Other Financial Information Earnings in 2017 included after-tax gains of approximately $1,800 relating to the sale of certain properties. Of this amount, approximately $850 and $950 related to downstream and upstream, respectively. Earnings in 2016 included after-tax gains of approximately $800 relating to the sale of certain properties, of which approximately $ 600 and $200 related to downstream and upstream assets, respectively. Earnings in 2017 included after-tax charges of approximately $900 for impairments and other asset write-offs related to upstream. Earnings in 2016 included after-tax charges of approximately $2,900 for impairments and other asset write-offs related to upstream, and $110 related to downstream. ##TABLE_START Other financial information is as follows:        Year ended December 31      Total financing interest and debt costs $   $  $ Less: Capitalized interest    Interest and debt expense $   $  $  Research and development expenses $   $  $ Excess of replacement cost over the carrying value of inventories (LIFO method) $ 3,937   $ 2,942  $ 3,745 LIFO losses on inventory drawdowns included in earnings $ (5 )   $ (88 )  $ (65 ) Foreign currency effects * $ (446 )   $  $ ##TABLE_END* Includes $(45) , $1 and $344 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, for the companys share of equity affiliates foreign currency effects. The company has $4,531 in goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, all of which is in the upstream segment and related primarily to the 2005 acquisition of Unocal. The company tested this goodwill for impairment during 2017 , and no impairment was required.

The system classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting  three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. Within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved reserves: probable and possible. The potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate. Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available. Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the Manager of Global Reserves, an organization that is separate from the Upstream operating organization. The Manager of Global Reserves has more than 30 years experience working in the oil and gas industry and holds both undergraduate and graduate degrees in geoscience. His experience includes various technical and management roles in providing reserve and resource estimates in support of major capital and exploration projects, and more than 10 years of managing oil and gas Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited reserves processes. He has been named a Distinguished Lecturer by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and is an active member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the SEPM Society of Sedimentary Geologists and the Society of Petroleum Engineers. All RAC members are degreed professionals, each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. The members are knowledgeable in SEC guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates. The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the Global Reserves Manual, which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves. During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the companys upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major changes are also reviewed with the companys Strategy and Planning Committee, whose members include the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The companys annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the Board. RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities. These reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the Global Reserves Manual.  In addition, third-party engineering consultants are used to supplement the companys own reserves estimation controls and procedures, including through the use of third-party audits of selected oil and gas assets. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions In 2017, additions to Chevrons proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling, production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regional geologic studies, and information from analogous reservoirs to provide reasonably certain proved reserves estimates. Both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past, and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates. Proved Undeveloped Reserves At the end of 2017, proved undeveloped reserves totaled 4.3 billion barrels of oil-equivalent (BOE), an increase of 721 million BOE from year-end 2016. The increase was due to 736 million BOE in extensions and discoveries, 366 million BOE in revisions, 39 million BOE in acquisitions and 5 million BOE in improved recovery, partially offset by the transfer of 419 million BOE to proved developed and 6 million BOE in sales. A major portion of this reserve increase is attributed to the company's activities in the Midland and Delaware basins. During 2017, investments totaling approximately $9.1 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. In Asia, expenditures during the year totaled approximately $4.0 billion, primarily related to development projects of the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. The United States accounted for about $3.3 billion related primarily to various development activities in the Gulf of Mexico and the Midland and Delaware basins. In Africa, about $0.7 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria, Angola and Republic of Congo. Development activities in Canada were primarily responsible for about $0.8 billion of expenditures in Other Americas. Reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels. At year-end 2017, the company held approximately 2.3 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in three locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 600 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to the Gorgon and Wheatstone projects. The company completed construction of liquefaction and other facilities to develop this natural gas. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion. In Africa, approximately 400 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, primarily due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited gas projects in Nigeria.  Affiliates account for about 1.4 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 1.0 billion BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more, with the majority related to the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion.  Annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2017, increases in commodity prices positively impacted the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in proved reserve increases, and negatively impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects. The year-end reserves volumes have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves sections. For 2017, this assessment did not result in any material changes in reserves classified as proved undeveloped. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 32 percent and 38 percent. The consistent completion of major capital projects has kept the ratio in a narrow range over this time period. Proved Reserve Quantities For the three years ending December 31, 2017 , the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the companys ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the companys control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, and civil unrest. At December 31, 2017 , proved reserves for the company were 11.7 billion BOE. The companys estimated net proved reserves of liquids including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil for the years 2015 , 2016 and 2017 are shown in the table on page 98 . The companys estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 99 . Noteworthy changes in liquids proved reserves for 2015 through 2017 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page: Revisions In 2015, entitlement effects and improved performance were responsible for the163 million barrel increase in the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. In Asia, entitlement effects and drilling performance across numerous assets resulted in the 164 million barrel increase. Improved field performance at various Nigerian fields, including Agbami, was primarily responsible for the 60 million barrel increase in Africa. Synthetic oil reserves in Canada increased by 80 million barrels, primarily due to entitlement effects. In 2016, entitlement effects were mainly responsible for the 64 million barrel increase in the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. Improved field performance at various Gulf of Mexico fields, including Jack/St Malo, and in the San Joaquin Valley were primarily responsible for the 109 million barrel increase in the United States. In Asia, entitlement effects, drilling and improved performance across numerous assets resulted in the 50 million barrel increase. In 2017, improved field performance at various Gulf of Mexico fields, including Jack/St Malo and Tahiti, and in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 280 million barrel increase in the United States. Improved field performance at various fields, including Agbami and Sonam in Nigeria, were responsible for the 79 million barrel increase in Africa. Synthetic oil reserves in Canada decreased by 42 million barrels, primarily due to entitlement effects. In the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan, entitlement effects were mainly responsible for the 53 million barrel decrease. Improved Recovery In 2016, improved recovery increased reserves by 293 million barrels, primarily due to the Future Growth Project in the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. Extensions and Discoveries In 2015, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 137 million barrel increase in the United States. In 2016 , extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 131 million barrel increase in the United States.

Net revisions of 480 BCF in Asia were primarily due to improved field performance in Thailand and to entitlement effects and improved performance in Kazakhstan. The majority of the net decrease of 435 BCF in Other Americas was due to the deferral of the infill drilling and compression projects as well as drilling results in Trinidad and Tobago. The 218 BCF increase for the TCO affiliate was due to entitlement effects and improved performance. In 2016 , development activities primarily at Wheatstone were responsible for the 853 BCF increase in Australia. Net revisions of 443 BCF in Asia were primarily due to improved field performance in China and Thailand. In 2017, reservoir performance and new seismic data in the greater Gorgon area were primarily responsible for the 1.5 TCF increase in Australia. Improved performance in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 670 BCF increase in the United States. The Sonam Field in Nigeria was primarily responsible for the 184 BCF increase in Africa. Extensions and Discoveries In 2015, extensions and discoveries of 659 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Appalachian region and the Midland and Delaware basins. In 2016, extensions and discoveries of 388 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Appalachian region and the Midland and Delaware basins. In 2017, extensions and discoveries of 1.4 TCF in the United States were primarily in the Appalachian region and the Midland and Delaware basins. Extensions and discoveries in the Duvernay Shale in Canada were primarily responsible for the 319 BCF increase in Other Americas. Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited Sales In 2016, sales of 544 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, Michigan and the midcontinent region. In 2017, sales of 177 BCF in the United States were primarily from the Midland and Delaware basins. Sale of the company's interests in Trinidad and Tobago was primarily responsible for the 129 BCF decrease in Other Americas. Table VI - Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is calculated in accordance with SEC and FASB requirements. This includes using the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, estimated future development and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions, estimated costs for asset retirement obligations (includes costs to retire existing wells and facilities in addition to those future wells and facilities necessary to produce proved undeveloped reserves), and estimated future income taxes based on appropriate statutory tax rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discount factors. Estimates of proved-reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuation requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and do not represent managements estimate of the companys future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves. In the following table, the caption Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows refers to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. ##TABLE_START Consolidated Companies  Affiliated Companies  Total Consolidated Other Australia/ and Affiliated Millions of dollars U.S. Americas Africa Asia Oceania Europe Total TCO Other Companies At December 31, 2017 Future cash inflows from production $ 94,086 $ 43,175 $ 47,828 $ 47,809 $ 77,557 $ 8,800 $ 319,255 $ 80,090 $ 13,632 $ 412,977 Future production costs (29,049 ) (20,044 ) (18,124 ) (18,640 ) (12,315 ) (6,345 ) (104,517 ) (22,050 ) (4,635 ) (131,202 ) Future development costs (10,849 ) (5,102 ) (3,808 ) (4,755 ) (6,682 ) (1,114 ) (32,310 ) (17,564 ) (1,760 ) (51,634 ) Future income taxes (10,803 ) (5,158 ) (17,845 ) (10,901 ) (17,568 ) (615 ) (62,890 ) (12,143 ) (3,250 ) (78,283 ) Undiscounted future net cash flows 43,385 12,871 8,051 13,513 40,992 119,538 28,333 3,987 151,858 10 percent midyear annual discount for timing of estimated cash flows (19,781 ) (8,483 ) (2,058 ) (3,846 ) (19,730 ) (53,691 ) (16,310 ) (1,844 ) (71,845 ) Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows $ 23,604 $ 4,388 $ 5,993 $ 9,667 $ 21,262 $ $ 65,847 $ 12,023 $ 2,143 $ 80,013 At December 31, 2016 Future cash inflows from production $ 53,777 $ 33,520 $ 39,072 $ 44,526 $ 63,781 $ 6,338 $ 241,014 $ 66,506 $ 11,244 $ 318,764 Future production costs (26,530 ) (20,413 ) (19,749 ) (19,815 ) (11,058 ) (5,500 ) (103,065 ) (13,610 ) (5,254 ) (121,929 ) Future development costs (7,830 ) (4,277 ) (4,186 ) (4,603 ) (7,804 ) (977 ) (29,677 ) (20,855 ) (2,192 ) (52,724 ) Future income taxes (3,454 ) (2,664 ) (9,684 ) (8,503 ) (13,476 ) (37,712 ) (9,613 ) (1,639 ) (48,964 ) Undiscounted future net cash flows 15,963 6,166 5,453 11,605 31,443 (70 ) 70,560 22,428 2,159 95,147 10 percent midyear annual discount for timing of estimated cash flows * (5,123 ) (3,646 ) (1,336 ) (3,137 ) (15,284 ) (28,204 ) (13,902 ) (972 ) (43,078 ) Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows $ 10,840 $ 2,520 $ 4,117 $ 8,468 $ 16,159 $ $ 42,356 $ 8,526 $ 1,187 $ 52,069 At December 31, 2015 Future cash inflows from production $ 67,536 $ 39,363 $ 52,128 $ 58,645 $ 93,550 $ 8,561 $ 319,783 $ 75,378 $ 17,519 $ 412,680 Future production costs (33,895 ) (26,477 ) (22,963 ) (27,499 ) (10,814 ) (6,994 ) (128,642 ) (17,959 ) (6,546 ) (153,147 ) Future development costs (12,625 ) (5,485 ) (6,562 ) (8,924 ) (11,612 ) (1,751 ) (46,959 ) (17,232 ) (3,226 ) (67,417 ) Future income taxes (4,161 ) (2,316 ) (14,681 ) (9,229 ) (21,337 ) (51,654 ) (12,056 ) (3,460 ) (67,170 ) Undiscounted future net cash flows 16,855 5,085 7,922 12,993 49,787 (114 ) 92,528 28,131 4,287 124,946 10 percent midyear annual discount for timing of estimated cash flows * (5,921 ) (2,833 ) (2,207 ) (3,673 ) (26,121 ) (40,473 ) (15,249 ) (2,242 ) (57,964 ) Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows $ 10,934 $ 2,252 $ 5,715 $ 9,320 $ 23,666 $ $ 52,055 $ 12,882 $ 2,045 $ 66,982 ##TABLE_END* Conforms to 2017 presentation.

Business General Development of Business Summary Description of Chevron Chevron Corporation, * a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. A list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on page E-1 . As of December 31, 2018 , Chevron had approximately 48,600 employees (including about 3,600 service station employees). Approximately 24,800 employees (including about 3,300 service station employees), or 51 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. Overview of Petroleum Industry Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies invest, conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. In the upstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining and marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining, manufacturing, sale and marketing of fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals. Operating Environment Refer to pages 28 through 34 of this Form 10-K in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the companys current business environment and outlook. Chevrons Strategic Direction Chevrons primary objective is to deliver industry-leading results and superior shareholder value in any business environment. In the upstream, the companys strategy is to deliver industry-leading returns while developing high-value resource opportunities.

In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term Chevron and such terms as the company, the corporation, our, we, us and \"its\" may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include affiliates of Chevron  i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. Description of Business and Properties The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects * in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2018 , and assets as of the end of 2018 and 2017  for the United States and the companys international geographic areas  are in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 66 . Similar comparative data for the companys investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Note 14 beginning on page 69 and Note 17 on page 77 . Refer to pages 39 and 40 of this Form 10-K in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company's capital and exploratory expenditures. Upstream Reserves Refer to Table V beginning on page 95 for a tabulation of the companys proved net liquids (including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil) and natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2016 and each year-end from 2016 through 2018 . Reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ended December 31, 2018 , are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations.

The single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or other producers, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risks. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices. Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the companys upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the companys credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns. In some cases, liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the companys suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the companys own results of operations and financial condition depends. The scope of Chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources  The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions, the companys business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The companys operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. Chevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. Cyberattacks targeting Chevrons process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the companys business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron's cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the companys information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business. Although Chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business. Cyber threat actors could compromise the companys process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or its assets, disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information, including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident. Further, the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on third-party IT systems, including the cloud. The company has limited control and visibility over such third-party IT systems. Cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations. The companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. Chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces, transports, refines and markets potentially hazardous materials, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page 70 . The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is self-insured, not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition. Political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevrons business The companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the companys operations, trade, currency exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. Further, Chevron is required to comply with U.S. sanctions and other trade laws and regulations which, depending upon their scope, could adversely impact the company's operations in certain countries. In addition, litigation or changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, could adversely affect the company's current or anticipated future operations and profitability. Regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could increase Chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for Chevrons hydrocarbon and other products  In the years ahead, companies in the energy industry, like Chevron, may be challenged by an increase in international and domestic regulation relating to GHG emissions. Like any significant changes in the regulatory environment, GHG regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the companys oil and gas resources economically infeasible. Although the IEAs World Energy Outlook scenarios anticipate oil and gas continuing to make up a significant portion of the global energy mix through 2040 and beyond given their respective advantages in transportation and power generation, if a new onset of regulation contributes to a decline in the demand for the companys products, this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition. International agreements and national, regional and state legislation (e.g., California AB32, SB32 and AB398) and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce GHG emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. For example, the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number of countries are studying and may adopt additional policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals. In some jurisdictions, the company is already subject to currently implemented programs such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard program, the European Union Emissions Trading System, and the California cap-and-trade program and related low carbon fuel standard obligations. Other jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate GHG emissions through similar or other mechanisms such as, for example, via a carbon tax (e.g., Singapore and Canada) or via a cap-and-trade program (e.g., Mexico and China). The landscape continues to be in a state of constant re-assessment and legal challenge with respect to these laws and regulations, making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate. GHG emissions-related laws and related regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbon-constrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the companys hydrocarbon-based products, make the companys products more expensive, adversely affect the economic feasibility of the companys resources, and adversely affect the companys sales volumes, revenues and margins. GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) that could be regulated include, among others, those associated with the companys exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys hydrocarbon products. Many of these activities, such as consumers and customers use of the companys products, as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the companys control. In addition, increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and additional private litigation against the company. Consideration of GHG issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the companys strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the companys long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. Additionally, the company assesses carbon pricing risks by considering carbon costs in these forecasts. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon dioxide injection, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction, the companys activities in it and market conditions. The ultimate effect of international agreements and national, regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions on the companys financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the GHG emissions reductions required, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products in the competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions-related agreements, legislation and measures on the companys financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes. Changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period  In preparing the companys periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the companys business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

Legal Proceedings Governmental Proceedings  The following is a description of legal proceedings that the company has determined to disclose for this reporting period that involve governmental authorities and certain monetary sanctions under federal, state and local laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment. As previously disclosed, on August 6, 2012, a piping failure and fire occurred at the Chevron refinery in Richmond, California. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued alleged findings of violation related to the incident on December 17, 2013, pursuant to its authority under the Clean Air Act Risk Management Plan program (RMP). Following the Richmond incident, EPA also conducted RMP inspections at Chevrons refineries in El Segundo, California; Pascagoula, Mississippi; Kapolei, Hawaii; and Salt Lake City, Utah. On October 24, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) lodged with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California a consent decree executed by Chevron, DOJ, EPA, and the State of Mississippi that resolves all of EPAs alleged findings of violation related to the Richmond incident and subsequent RMP inspections. The consent decree includes the payment of a civil penalty of $2.95 million and the funding of supplemental environmental projects totaling $10 million. Chevron also agreed, as part of the consent decree, to investments in process safety enhancements at its current refineries, estimated at $150 million, a portion of which has already been spent. The consent decree is pending court approval. Chevron facilities within the jurisdiction of Californias Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) currently have multiple outstanding Notices of Violation (NOVs) issued by BAAQMD. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. As previously disclosed, on June 26, 2018, Chevron received a proposal from the BAAQMD seeking to collectively resolve certain NOVs issued between 2015 and 2017 to Chevrons Richmond Refinery. On November 5, 2018, Chevron and the BAAQMD entered into a settlement agreement to resolve allegations in the disputed NOVs for a civil penalty of $222,000. Chevron facilities within the jurisdiction of Californias South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) currently have multiple outstanding NOVs issued by SCAQMD. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more.

Business Environment and Outlook Chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of Congo, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela. Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the companys control. In the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. It is the company's objective to deliver competitive results and stockholder value in any business environment. Periods of sustained lower prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses and capital and exploratory expenditures, along with other measures intended to improve financial performance. The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. Note 16 provides the companys effective income tax rate for the last three years. Refer to the \"Cautionary Statement Relevant to Forward-Looking Information\" on page 2 and to \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 18 through 21 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company's results of operations or financial condition. The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the companys financial performance and value growth. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods. The company's asset sale program for 2018 through 2020 is targeting before-tax proceeds of $5-10 billion. Proceeds related to asset sales were $2.0 billion in 2018. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning. Comments related to earnings trends for the companys major business areas are as follows: Upstream  Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or other producers, actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the companys production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the companys ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax and other applicable laws and regulations. The company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. However, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the companys control including, among other things, the general level of inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, commodity prices and prices charged by the industrys material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industrys own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. Modest cost pressures continue in rig-related services across North America unconventional markets. Cost pressures have softened in well completion activity particularly in the Permian Basin, but are expected to rise when pipeline takeaway constraints are resolved in late 2019. International and offshore markets are showing indications of increased activity levels with limited cost pressures to date. Capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses could also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, or other factors. The chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The majority of the companys equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark. The Brent price averaged $71 per barrel for the full-year 2018 , compared to $54 in 2017 . Crude oil prices increased throughout the first three quarters of 2018 due to solid demand combined with OPEC production cuts. Late in the year, continued U.S. shale growth, combined with unexpected short-term waivers from Iranian sanctions granted to several countries, led to excess supply conditions, resulting in a decrease in oil prices. In response, OPEC agreed to new production cuts in early December. As of mid-February 2019 , the Brent price was $64 per barrel. The WTI price averaged $65 per barrel for the full-year 2018 , compared to $51 in 2017 . WTI traded at a discount to Brent throughout 2018. Differentials to Brent have ranged between $3 to $10 in 2018 primarily due to pipeline infrastructure constraints which have restricted flows on the inland crude to export outlets on the Gulf Coast, in addition to variability in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations other factors impacting supply and demand of each benchmark crude. As of mid-February 2019 , the WTI price was $54 per barrel. Chevron has interests in the production of heavy crude oil in California, Indonesia, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Venezuela and in certain fields in Angola, China and the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea. (See page 37 for the companys average U.S. and international crude oil sales prices.) In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in regional markets. Fluctuations in the price of natural gas in the United States are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced and stored in North America. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged $3.12 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) during 2018 , compared with $2.97 during 2017 . As of mid-February 2019 , the Henry Hub spot price was $2.61 per MCF. Outside the United States, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. Chevron sells natural gas into the domestic pipeline market in many locations. In some locations, Chevron has invested in long-term projects to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. The company's long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG offtake from the operated Australian LNG projects is committed under binding long-term contracts, with the remainder to be sold in the Asian spot LNG market. The Asian spot market reflects the supply and demand for LNG in the Pacific Basin and is not directly linked to crude oil prices. International natural gas realizations averaged $6.29 per MCF during 2018 , compared with $4.62 per MCF during 2017 . (See page 37 for the companys average natural gas realizations for the U.S. and international regions.) The companys worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2018 averaged 2.930 million barrels per day. About one-sixth of the companys net oil-equivalent production in 2018 occurred in the OPEC-member countries of Angola, Nigeria, Republic of Congo and Venezuela. OPEC quotas had no effect on the companys net crude oil production in 2018 or 2017 . The company estimates that net oil-equivalent production in 2019 will grow 4 to 7 percent compared to 2018 , assuming a Brent crude oil price of $60 per barrel and excluding the impact of anticipated 2019 asset sales. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction; reservoir performance; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. The company has increased its investment emphasis on short-cycle projects. ##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, production was shut-in beginning in May 2015 as a result of difficulties in securing work and equipment permits. Net oil-equivalent production in the Partitioned Zone in 2014 was 81,000 barrels per day. During 2015, net oil-equivalent production averaged 28,000 barrels per day. As of early 2019, production remains shut in and the exact timing of a production restart is uncertain and dependent on dispute resolution between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The financial effects from the loss of production in 2018 were not significant and are not expected to be significant in 2019. Chevron has interests in Venezuelan crude oil production assets operated by independent equity affiliates. During 2018, net oil equivalent production in Venezuela averaged 44,000 barrels per day. The operating environment in Venezuela has been deteriorating for some time. In January 2019, the United States government issued sanctions against the Venezuelan national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PdVSA), which is the companys partner in the equity affiliates. The equity affiliates continue to operate, and the company is conducting its business pursuant to general licenses issued coincident with the new sanctions. Future events could result in the environment in Venezuela becoming more challenged, which could lead to increased business disruption and volatility in the associated financial results. Net proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 12.1 billion barrels of oil-equivalent at year-end 2018 , an increase of 3 percent from year-end 2017 . The reserve replacement ratio in 2018 was 136 percent. Refer to Table V beginning on page 95 for a tabulation of the companys proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2016 and each year-end from 2016 through 2018 , and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending December 31, 2018 . Refer to the Results of Operations section on pages 32 through 34 for additional discussion of the companys upstream business. Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events. Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the companys refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the companys shipping operations, which are driven by the industrys demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the companys control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the companys refining, marketing and petrochemical assets and changes in tax laws and regulations. The companys most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. Refer to the Results of Operations section on pages 32 through 34 for additional discussion of the companys downstream operations. All Other  consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies. Operating Developments  Key operating developments and other events during 2018 and early 2019 included the following: Upstream  Australia  Achieved start-up of Train 2 at the Wheatstone LNG Project. United States Produced first oil from the Big Foot Project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Downstream  South Africa and Botswana Completed the sale of refining, marketing and lubricant assets. United States Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), the companys 50 percent-owned affiliate, commenced operations of a new ethane cracker at its Cedar Bayou facility in Baytown, Texas. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations United States In January 2019, Chevron announced it has signed an agreement to acquire a 110,000 barrels per day refinery located in Pasadena, Texas. The transaction is expected to close later in the first-half of 2019, subject to regulatory approvals. Other  Common Stock Dividends The 2018 annual dividend was $4.48 per share, making 2018 the 31st consecutive year that the company increased its annual per share dividend payout. In January 2019, the company's Board of Directors approved a $0.07 per share increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.19 per share, payable in March 2019, representing an increase of 6 percent. Common Stock Repurchase Program The company purchased $1.75 billion of its common stock in 2018 under its stock repurchase program. Results of Operations  The following section presents the results of operations and variances on an after-tax basis for the companys business segments  Upstream and Downstream  as well as for All Other. Earnings are also presented for the U.S. and international geographic areas of the Upstream and Downstream business segments. Refer to Note 13 , beginning on page 66 , for a discussion of the companys reportable segments.

The decrease in earnings was primarily due to the absence of the 2017 benefit from U.S. tax reform of $3.33 billion, higher other tax items of $160 million and higher exploration expense of $350 million, partially offset by higher crude oil realizations of $2.45 billion and higher crude oil production of $1.12 billion. U.S. upstream earnings were $3.64 billion in 2017 , compared with a loss of $2.05 billion from 2016 . The improvement in earnings reflected a benefit of $3.33 billion from U.S. tax reform, higher crude oil and natural gas realizations of $1.3 billion and lower depreciation expenses of $650 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in impairments and other asset write-offs. Lower operating expenses of $140 million also contributed to the improvement. The companys average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2018 was $58.17 per barrel, compared with $44.53 in 2017 and $35.00 in 2016 . The average natural gas realization was $1.86 per thousand cubic feet in 2018 , compared with $2.10 in 2017 and $1.59 in 2016 . Net oil-equivalent production in 2018 averaged 791,000 barrels per day, up 16 percent from 2017 and up 14 percent from 2016 . Between 2018 and 2017 , production increases from shale and tight properties in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Mexico and base business in the Gulf of Mexico were partially offset by the effect of asset sales of 35,000 barrels per day. Between 2017 and 2016 , production increases from shale and tight properties in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and base business in the Gulf of Mexico were more than offset by the effect of asset sales of 59,000 barrels per day and normal field declines. The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2018 averaged 618,000 barrels per day, up 19 percent from 2017 and up 23 percent from 2016 . Net natural gas production averaged 1.03 billion cubic feet per day in 2018 , up 7 percent from 2017 and down 8 percent from 2016 .

International Upstream ##TABLE_START Millions of dollars    Earnings * $ 10,038   $ 4,510  $ (483 ) * Includes foreign currency effects: $   $ (456 )  $ ##TABLE_ENDInternational upstream earnings were $10.04 billion in 2018 , compared with $4.51 billion in 2017 . The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher crude oil and natural gas realizations of $3.38 billion and $1.38 billion, respectively, higher natural gas sales volumes of $1.67 billion, partially offset by lower gains on asset sales of $640 million, higher depreciation, operating and tax expenses of $470 million, $460 million and $230 million, respectively. Foreign currency effects had a favorable impact on earnings of $1.00 billion between periods. International upstream earnings were $4.51 billion in 2017 , compared with a loss of $483 million in 2016 . The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher crude oil realizations of $2.59 billion, higher natural gas sales volumes of $1.22 billion, higher gains on asset sales of $750 million, and lower operating expenses of $410 million. Foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact on earnings of $578 million between periods. The companys average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2018 was $64.25 per barrel, compared with $49.46 in 2017 and $38.61 in 2016 . The average natural gas realization was $6.29 per thousand cubic feet in 2018 , compared with $4.62 and $4.02 in 2017 and 2016 , respectively. International net oil-equivalent production was 2.14 million barrels per day in 2018 , up 4 percent from 2017 and up 12 percent from 2016 . Between 2018 and 2017 , production increases from major capital projects, primarily Wheatstone and Gorgon in Australia, were partially offset by normal field declines, production entitlement effects and the impact of asset sales of 14,000 barrels per day. Between 2017 and 2016 , production increases from major capital projects and lower planned maintenance-related downtime were partially offset by production entitlement effects in several locations and normal field declines. The net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was 1.16 million barrels per day in 2018 , down 3 percent from 2017 and down 4 percent from 2016 . International net natural gas production of 5.86 billion cubic feet per day in 2018 was up 16 percent from 2017 and up 42 percent from 2016 .

The decrease was mainly due to the absence of the 2017 benefit from U.S. tax reform of $1.16 billion and higher operating expenses of $420 million, primarily due to planned refinery turnaround activity. Partially offsetting these were higher margins on refined product sales of $380 million and higher equity earnings from the 50 percent-owned CPChem of $320 million, primarily reflecting the absence of impacts from Hurricane Harvey. U.S. downstream operations earned $2.94 billion in 2017 , compared with $1.31 billion in 2016 . The increase was primarily due to a $1.16 billion benefit from U.S. tax reform, higher margins on refined product sales of $380 million, lower operating expenses of $160 million, and the absence of an asset impairment of $110 million. Partially offsetting this increase were lower gains on asset sales of $90 million and lower earnings from the 50 percent-owned CPChem of $70 million, primarily reflecting the impacts from Hurricane Harvey. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Total refined product sales of 1.22 million barrels per day in 2018 were up 2 percent from 2017 . Sales were 1.20 million barrels per day in 2017 , a decrease of 1 percent from 2016 , primarily due to the divestment of Hawaii refining and marketing assets in fourth quarter 2016. Refer to the Selected Operating Data table on page 37 for a three-year comparison of sales volumes of gasoline and other refined products and refinery input volumes.

The decrease in earnings was largely due to lower margins on refined product sales of $590 million and lower gains on asset sales of $470 million, partially offset by lower operating expenses of $290 million. The sale of the company's Canadian refining and marketing business in third quarter 2017 and the sale of the southern Africa refining and marketing business in third quarter 2018 primarily contributed to the lower margins and operating expenses. Foreign currency effects had a favorable impact on earnings of $161 million between periods. International downstream earned $2.28 billion in 2017 , compared with $2.13 billion in 2016 . The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher gains on asset sales of $360 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $140 million. Foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact on earnings of $65 million between periods. Total refined product sales of 1.44 million barrels per day in 2018 were down 4 percent from 2017 , primarily due to the sales of the company's Canadian refining and marketing assets in third quarter 2017 and southern Africa refining and marketing business in third quarter 2018. Sales of 1.49 million barrels per day in 2017 were up 2 percent from 2016 , primarily due to higher diesel and jet fuel sales.

Net charges in 2018 decreased $1.88 billion from 2017 . The change between periods was mainly due to absence of a prior year tax charge of $2.47 billion related to U.S. tax reform, lower employee expenses and the absence of a reclamation related charge for a former mining asset, partially offset by other unfavorable tax items and higher interest expense. Foreign currency effects increased net charges by $105 million between periods. Net charges in 2017 increased $2.77 billion from 2016 , mainly due to higher tax items, primarily reflecting a $2.47 billion expense from U.S. tax reform, higher interest expense and a reclamation related charge for a former mining asset, partially offset by lower employee expense.

This line was added to the Consolidated Statement of Income in accordance with the adoption of ASU 2017-07. ##TABLE_START Millions of dollars    Income tax expense (benefit) $ 5,715   $ (48 )  $ (1,729 ) ##TABLE_END The increase in income tax expense in 2018 of $5.76 billion is due to the increase in total income before tax for the company of $11.35 billion and the absence of the remeasurement benefits from U.S. tax reform recognized in 2017. U.S. income before tax increased from a loss of $441 million in 2017 to a profit of $4.73 billion in 2018. This increase in earnings before tax was primarily driven by the effect of higher crude oil prices. The U.S. tax charge increased by $3.69 billion between year-over-year periods from a $2.97 billion benefit in 2017 to a $724 million charge in 2018. 2017 included a $2.02 billion benefit from U.S. tax reform, which primarily reflected the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. International income before tax increased from $9.66 billion in 2017 to $15.84 billion in 2018. This $6.18 billion increase was primarily driven by the effect of higher crude oil prices. The higher crude prices primarily drove the $2.06 billion increase in international income tax expense between year-over-year periods, from $2.93 billion in 2017 to $4.99 billion in 2018. The decline in income tax benefit in 2017 of $1.68 billion is due to the increase in total income before tax for the company of $11.38 billion and the remeasurement impacts of U.S. tax reform. U.S. losses before tax decreased from a loss of $4.32 billion in 2016 to a loss of $441 million in 2017. This decrease in losses before tax was primarily driven by the effect of higher crude oil prices. The U.S. tax benefit increased by $650 million between year-over-year periods from $2.32 billion in 2016 to $2.97 billion in 2017. The U.S. tax benefit for 2017 included a $2.02 billion benefit from U.S. tax reform, which primarily reflected the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a reduction of $1.37 billion as result of the impact of a decrease in losses before tax of $3.88 billion. International income before tax increased from $2.16 billion in 2016 to $9.66 billion in 2017. This $7.50 billion increase was primarily driven by the effect of higher crude oil prices and gains on asset sales primarily in Indonesia and Canada. The higher crude prices primarily drove the $2.34 billion increase in international income tax expense between year-over-year periods, from $588 million in 2016 to $2.93 billion in 2017.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Time Deposits  Total balances were $10.3 billion and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2018 was $30.6 billion , compared with $20.3 billion in 2017 and $12.7 billion in 2016 , reflecting higher crude oil prices and increased production. Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately $1.0 billion in 2018 , $1.0 billion in 2017 and $0.9 billion in 2016 . Cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $2.0 billion in 2018 , $4.9 billion in 2017 and $3.2 billion in 2016 . Restricted cash of $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, was held in cash and short-term marketable securities and recorded as Deferred charges and other assets and Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are generally associated with upstream abandonment activities, tax payments, funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges and refundable deposits related to pending asset sales. Dividends Dividends paid to common stockholders were $8.5 billion in 2018 , $8.1 billion in 2017 and $8.0 billion in 2016 . Debt and Capital Lease Obligations  Total debt and capital lease obligations were $34.5 billion at December 31, 2018 , down from $38.8 billion at year-end 2017 . The $4.3 billion decrease in total debt and capital lease obligations during 2018 was primarily due to the repayment of long-term notes totaling $6.7 billion as they matured during 2018, partly offset by an increase in commercial paper. The companys debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $15.6 billion at December 31, 2018 , compared with $15.2 billion at year-end 2017 . Of these amounts, $9.9 billion and $10.0 billion were reclassified to long-term debt at the end of 2018 and 2017 , respectively. At year-end 2018 , settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2019 , as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. Chevron has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in May 2021 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_START ##TABLE_ENDThe major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the companys debt, and the companys cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation and Texaco Capital Inc. All of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA by Standard and Poors Corporation and Aa2 by Moodys Investors Service. The companys U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poors and P-1 by Moodys. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities. The companys future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, cash that may be generated from asset dispositions, the capital program and shareholder distributions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company can also modify capital spending plans and discontinue or curtail the stock repurchase program to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and also remain committed to retaining the companys high-quality debt ratings. Committed Credit Facilities Information related to committed credit facilities is included in Note 18 , Short-Term Debt, on page 77 . Common Stock Repurchase Program In July 2010, the Board of Directors approved an ongoing stock repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. From the inception of the program through the end of 2018, the company purchased 195.8 million shares for $21.75 billion, including 14.9 million shares for $1.75 billion in the second half 2018 . On February 1, 2019, the company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program with a maximum dollar limit of $25 billion and no set term limits. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as determined by the company. The timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the company's shares, general market and economic conditions, and other factors. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Capital and Exploratory Expenditures  Capital and exploratory expenditures by business segment for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 are as follows: ##TABLE_START         Millions of dollars U.S. Intl.

In 2017 and 2016 , expenditures were $ 18.8 billion and $ 22.4 billion, respectively, including the companys share of affiliates expenditures of $ 4.7 billion and $ 3.8 billion, respectively. Of the $20.1 billion of expenditures in 2018 , 88 percent , or $17.7 billion , related to upstream activities. Approximately 87 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2017 and 90 percent in 2016 . International upstream accounted for 60 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2018 , 69 percent in 2017 and 77 percent in 2016 . The company estimates that 2019 capital and exploratory expenditures will be $20 billion, including $6.3 billion of spending by affiliates. This is in line with 2018 expenditures, and reflects a robust portfolio of upstream and downstream investments, highlighted by the company's Permian Basin position, and additional shale and tight development in other basins. Approximately 87 percent of the total, or $17.3 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities. Approximately $10.4 billion of planned upstream capital spending relates to base producing assets, including $3.6 billion for the Permian and $1.6 billion for other shale and tight rock investments. Approximately $5.1 billion of the upstream program is planned for major capital projects underway, including $4.3 billion associated with the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project at the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan. Global exploration funding is expected to be about $1.3 billion. Remaining upstream spend is budgeted for early stage projects supporting potential future developments. The company will continue to monitor crude oil market conditions and expects to further restrict capital outlays should oil price conditions deteriorate. Worldwide downstream spending in 2019 is estimated to be $2.5 billion, with $1.5 billion estimated for projects in the United States. Investments in technology businesses and other corporate operations in 2019 are budgeted at $0.2 billion. Noncontrolling Interests The company had noncontrolling interests of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017 . Distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled $91 million and $78 million in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Pension Obligations  Information related to pension plan contributions is included beginning on page 81 in Note 22 , Employee Benefit Plans, under the heading Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.

The current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that Chevrons inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. At year-end 2018 , the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $5.1 billion . Interest Coverage Ratio  Income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the companys ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. The companys interest coverage ratio in 2018 was higher than 2017 and 2016 due to higher income. Debt Ratio Total debt as a percentage of total debt plus Chevron Corporation Stockholders' Equity, which indicates the companys leverage. The company's debt ratio was 18.2 percent at year-end 2018 , compared with 20.7 percent and 24.1 percent at year-end 2017 and 2016 , respectively.

Financial and Derivative Instrument Market Risk  The market risk associated with the companys portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below. The estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the companys projection of future market changes. The actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. Derivative Commodity Instruments Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities were not material to the companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2018 . The companys market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal Risk Control group in accordance with the companys risk management policies. The company's risk management practices and its compliance with policies are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the companys Board of Directors. Derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value of Chevrons derivative commodity instruments in 2018 was not material to the company's results of operations. The company uses the Monte Carlo simulation method as its Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value, at the 95% confidence level with a one-day holding period, from the effect of adverse changes in market Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. Based on these inputs, the VaR for the company's primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was not material to the company's cash flows or results of operations. Foreign Currency  The company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2018 . Interest Rates  The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At year-end 2018 , the company had no interest rate swaps. Transactions With Related Parties  Chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. Refer to Other Information on page 70 , in Note 14 , Investments and Advances, for further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.

These asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues. The liability balance of approximately $14.1 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2018 related primarily to upstream properties. For the companys other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation. Refer to the discussion below for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company's 2018 environmental expenditures. Refer to Note 2 3 on page 86 for additional discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves.

Other Contingencies  Information related to other contingencies is included on page 87 in Note 2 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading Other Contingencies. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Environmental Matters The company is subject to various international, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and market-based programs. These laws, regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. For example, international agreements and national, regional, and state legislation (e.g., California AB32, SB32 and AB398) and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. Consideration of GHG issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the companys strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the companys long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. In addition, legislation and regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve at the national, state and local levels. Refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 18 through 21 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the companys results of operations or financial condition. Most of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to: prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants into the environment; remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials; or comply with new environmental laws or regulations. Although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse effect on the company's liquidity or financial position. Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. The company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. An obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards. Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2018 at approximately $2.0 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately $0.5 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.5 billion of costs associated with the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the abandonment and restoration of sites. For 2019 , total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $0.5 billion . These capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. Such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are based on managements experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. The discussion in this section of critical accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), wherein: ##TABLE_START 1. the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters, or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2. the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the companys financial condition or operating performance is material. ##TABLE_END The development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed critical, and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Oil and Gas Reserves Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron's estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development and production costs. The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron's Consolidated Financial Statements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following: ##TABLE_START 1. Amortization - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOP basis using total proved reserves. During 2018 , Chevron's UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DDA) for oil and gas properties was $14.8 billion , and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2018 were 6.1 billion barrels for consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties, UOP DDA in 2018 would have increased by approximately $800 million . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2. Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. Proved reserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. For a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments, see Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates below. ##TABLE_END Refer to Table V, Reserve Quantity Information, beginning on page 95 , for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ended December 31, 2018 , and to Table VII, Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves on page 101 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31, 2018 . This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1, beginning on page 55 , which includes a description of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities. Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates The company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PPE) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value. Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the companys business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 17 on page 77 and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" beginning on page 55 . The company routinely performs impairment reviews when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company's crude oil or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets associated carrying values. Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the companys carrying value. When this occurs, a determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable. No individually material impairments of PPE or Investments were recorded for 2018 or 2017. The company reported impairments for certain oil and gas properties in Brazil and the United States during 2016 due to reservoir performance and lower crude oil prices. A sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the companys PPE and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets. Asset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2018 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 2 4 on page 88 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans  Note 22 , beginning on page 81 , includes information on the funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions. The determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. Critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. Information related to the companys processes to develop these assumptions is included on page 83 in Note 22 under the relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes beyond the company's control. For 2018 , the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 3.7 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 3.0 percent for U.S. pension plans. The actual return for 2018 was negative . For the 10 years ended December 31, 2018 , actual asset returns averaged 7.9 percent for these plans. Additionally, with the exception of three years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for these plans equaled or exceeded 6.75 percent during each year. Total pension expense for 2018 was $1.1 billion . An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the companys primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 63 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2018 by approximately $83 million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2018 by approximately $271 million. The aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2018 , was a net liability of approximately $3.9 billion . An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2018 , the company used a discount rate of 4.2 percent to measure the obligations for the U.S. pension plans. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the companys primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 62 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $339 million, and would have decreased the plans underfunded status from approximately $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations For the companys OPEB plans, expense for 2018 was $123 million , and the total liability, all unfunded at the end of 2018 , was $2.4 billion . For the main U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a discount rate for service cost of 3.8 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 3.2 percent to measure expense in 2018 , and a 4.3 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at December 31, 2018 . Discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis, resulted in an immaterial impact on 2018 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2018 . For information on the sensitivity of the health care cost-trend rate, refer to page 83 in Note 22 under the heading Other Benefit Assumptions. Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page 82 in Note 22 for a description of the method used to amortize the $4.6 billion of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2018 , and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2019 . In addition, information related to company contributions is included on page 85 in Note 22 under the heading Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments. Contingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology. Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as Operating expenses or Selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is more likely than not (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 2 3 beginning on page 86 . Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31, 2018 . An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.

The statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and fairly represent the transactions and financial position of the company. The financial statements include amounts that are based on managements best estimates and judgments. As stated in its report included herein, the independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the companys consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Board of Directors of Chevron has an Audit Committee composed of directors who are not officers or employees of the company. The Audit Committee meets regularly with members of management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm to review accounting, internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters. Both the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm have free and direct access to the Audit Committee without the presence of management. The company's management has evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2018. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the company's disclosure controls are effective in ensuring that information required to be recorded, processed, summarized and reported, are done within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.      Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   The companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this evaluation, the companys management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018. The effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report included herein.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017,  and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013)  issued by the COSO.   Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated  financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.   Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.     San Francisco, California   February 22, 2019   We have served as the Companys auditor since 1935.   ##TABLE_ENDConsolidated Statement of Income  Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts ##TABLE_START            Year ended December 31          Revenues and Other Income         Sales and other operating revenues 1 $ 158,902   $ 134,674  $ 110,215   Income from equity affiliates 6,327   4,438  2,661   Other income 1,110   2,610  1,596   Total Revenues and Other Income 166,339   141,722 114,472   Costs and Other Deductions         Purchased crude oil and products 94,578   75,765  59,321   Operating expenses 2 20,544   19,127  19,902   Selling, general and administrative expenses 2 3,838   4,110  4,305   Exploration expenses 1,210    1,033   Depreciation, depletion and amortization 19,419  19,349 19,457   Taxes other than on income 1 4,867   12,331  11,668   Interest and debt expense      Other components of net periodic benefit costs 2      Total Costs and Other Deductions 145,764   132,501  116,632   Income (Loss) Before Income Tax Expense 20,575   9,221  (2,160 )   Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 5,715   (48 )  (1,729 )   Net Income (Loss) 14,860   9,269  (431 )   Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests      Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation $ 14,824   $ 9,195  $ (497 )   Per Share of Common Stock         Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation         - Basic $ 7.81   $ 4.88  $ (0.27 )   - Diluted $ 7.74   $ 4.85  $ (0.27 )   1 2017 and 2016 include excise, value-added and similar taxes of $7,189 and $6,905, respectively, collected on behalf of third parties.

See accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.           ##TABLE_ENDNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies General The companys Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from these estimates as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percent-owned and any variable-interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. Investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the companys carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial performance, and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value. The new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Differences between the companys carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the companys analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the companys share of the affiliates reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliates historical book values. Noncontrolling Interests Ownership interests in the companys subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented separately from the parents equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Equity. Fair Value Measurements  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market. Derivatives  The majority of the companys activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivative instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the companys commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the companys fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet. Short-Term Investments All short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in highly liquid debt securities. Those investments that are part of the companys cash management portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as Cash equivalents. Bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days are reported as Time deposits. The balance of short-term investments is reported as Marketable securities and is marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses included in Other comprehensive income. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Inventories  Crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market. Materials, supplies and other inventories are primarily stated at cost or net realizable value. Properties, Plant and Equipment  The successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. All other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note 20 , beginning on page 79 , for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs. Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market value of an asset (including changes to the commodity price forecast), significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas properties, the company performs impairment reviews on a country, concession, PSC, development area or field basis, as appropriate. In Downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Refer to Note 8 , beginning on page 63 , relating to fair value measurements. The fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note 2 4 , on page 88 , relating to AROs. Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Impairments of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed. The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized leased assets. Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as Other income. Expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized. Goodwill Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. The company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually at December 31, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized. Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an ARO Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts is made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Refer to Note 2 4 , on page 88 , for a discussion of the companys AROs. For federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares. The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the companys best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the companys own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured. Currency Translation The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the companys consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in Currency translation adjustment on the Consolidated Statement of Equity. Revenue Recognition The company accounts for each delivery order of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemical products as a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs at the point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer. Payment is generally due within 30 days of delivery. The company accounts for delivery transportation as a fulfillment cost, not a separate performance obligation, and recognizes these costs as an operating expense in the period when revenue for the related commodity is recognized. Revenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the customer. The companys commodity sales are typically based on prevailing market-based prices and may include discounts and allowances. Until market prices become known under terms of the companys contracts, the transaction price included in revenue is based on the companys estimate of the most likely outcome. Discounts and allowances are estimated using a combination of historical and recent data trends. When deliveries contain multiple products, an observable standalone selling price is generally used to measure revenue for each product. The company includes estimates in the transaction price only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable in subsequent periods. Excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer are presented on a net basis in \"Taxes other than on income\" on the Consolidated Statement of Income, on page 50 . Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in Purchased crude oil and products on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Prior to the adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemicals products, and all other sources were recorded when title passed to the customer, net of royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. Revenues from natural gas production from properties in which Chevron has an interest with other producers were generally recognized using the entitlement method. Excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer were presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation  The company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to certain employees. For equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. The company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period in which an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. The companys Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards include stock options and stock appreciation rights, which have graded vesting provisions by which one-third of each award vests on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. In addition, performance shares granted under the company's LTIP will vest at the end of the three -year performance period. For awards granted under the company's LTIP beginning in 2017, stock options and stock appreciation rights have graded vesting by which one third of each award vests annually on each January 31 on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. Standard restricted stock unit awards have cliff vesting by which the total award will vest on January 31 on or after the fifth anniversary of the grant date, subject to adjustment upon termination pursuant to the satisfaction of certain criteria. The company amortizes these awards on a straight-line basis.

Purchases totaled $1,751 , $1 and $2 in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The company purchased 14.9 million shares under its stock repurchase plan for $ 1,750 in 2018 . No shares were repurchased under the plan in 2017 or 2016 . The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows excludes changes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet that did not affect cash. \"Depreciation, depletion and amortization,\" \"Dry hole expense\" and \"Deferred income tax provision\" collectively include approximately $1.1 billion in non-cash reductions to properties, plant and equipment recorded in 2018 relating to impairments and other non-cash charges. Refer also to Note 2 4 , on page 88 , for a discussion of revisions to the companys AROs that also did not involve cash receipts or payments for the three years ending December 31, 2018 . Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts The major components of Capital expenditures and the reconciliation of this amount to the reported capital and exploratory expenditures, including equity affiliates, are presented in the following table: ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31      Additions to properties, plant and equipment * $ 13,384   $ 13,222  $ 17,742 Additions to investments    Current-year dry hole expenditures    Payments for other liabilities and assets, net (1 )     (1 ) Capital expenditures 13,792   13,404  18,109 Expensed exploration expenditures    Assets acquired through capital lease obligations and other financing obligations    Capital and exploratory expenditures, excluding equity affiliates 14,390   14,078  18,658 Company's share of expenditures by equity affiliates 5,716   4,743  3,770 Capital and exploratory expenditures, including equity affiliates $ 20,106   $ 18,821  $ 22,428 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START *  Excludes non-cash additions of $25 in 2018 , $1,183 in 2017 and $56 in 2016 . ##TABLE_END On January 1, 2018, Chevron adopted Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) 2016-15 and 2016-18, which require retrospective adjustment of prior periods in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition to other requirements, ASU 2016-15 specifies new standards for the classification of distributions from equity affiliates. In adopting these new standards, Chevron utilized the cumulative earnings approach to evaluate returns on and returns of investment from equity affiliates. For the year ended 2017 and 2016 , a total of $166 and $322 , respectively, was reclassified from Distributions less than income from equity affiliates to Proceeds and deposits related to asset sales and returns of investment. Adoption of ASU 2016-18 requires the inclusion of restricted cash and associated changes in restricted cash in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The impact of ASU 2016-18 is captured across several line items in the Statement of Cash Flows, including Net decrease (increase) in operating working capital, Decrease (increase) in other deferred charges, and Proceeds and deposits related to asset sales and returns of investment with associated net changes captured in both Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities and Net Cash Used for Investing Activities. The line item Net sales (purchases) of other short-term investments was removed in conjunction with the adoption of ASU 2016-18. The table below quantifies the beginning and ending balances of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheet: ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31       Cash and cash equivalents $ 9,342   $ 4,813  $ 6,988  $ 11,022 Restricted cash included in \"Prepaid expenses and other current assets\"     Restricted cash included in \"Deferred charges and other assets\"     Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 10,481   $ 5,943  $ 8,414  $ 12,122 ##TABLE_END Note 4  New Accounting Standards Revenue Recognition (Topic 606): Revenue from Contracts with Customers  On January 1, 2018, Chevron adopted ASU 2014-09 and its related amendments using the modified retrospective transition method, which did not require the restatement of prior periods. The impact of the adoption of the standard did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements. For additional information on the companys revenue, refer to Note 25 beginning on page 88 . Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20)  On January 1, 2018, the company adopted ASU 2017-05, which provides clarification regarding the guidance on accounting for the derecognition of nonfinancial assets. The adoption of the standard had no impact on the companys consolidated financial statements. Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)  Effective January 1, 2018, Chevron adopted ASU 2017-07 on a retrospective basis. The standard requires the disaggregation of the service cost component from the other components of net periodic benefit cost and allows only the service cost component of net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization. The effects of retrospective adoption on the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2017 and 2016 were to move $310 and $366 from \"Operating expenses\" and $338 and $379 from \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" to \"Other components of net periodic benefits cost,\" respectively. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments Effective January 1, 2018, Chevron adopted ASU 2016-15 on a retrospective basis. The standard provides clarification on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. For additional information, refer to Note 3 beginning on page 59 . Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Restricted Cash Effective January 1, 2018, Chevron adopted ASU 2016-18 on a retrospective basis. The standard requires an entity to explain the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and to provide a reconciliation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are not separately presented or are presented in more than one line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The companys restricted cash balances are now included in the beginning and ending balances on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. For additional information, refer to Note 3 beginning on page 59 . Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income In fourth quarter 2018, the company elected to early adopt ASU 2018-02, which permits the reclassification of stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of U.S. tax reform. Accordingly, Chevron reclassified $562 from \"Accumulated other comprehensive losses\" to \"Retained earnings\" associated with the reduction of the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. In accordance with its accounting policy, the company releases stranded income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income in the period the underlying activity ceases to exist. ASU 2018-02 allowed for the reclassification of stranded tax effects as a result of the change in tax rates due to U.S. tax reform to be recorded upon adoption of the ASU, rather than at the actual date that the underlying activity ceases to exist. For additional detail, refer to Note 2 beginning on page 58 . Leases (Topic 842)  In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02, which became effective for the company January 1, 2019. The standard requires that lessees present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The company plans to elect the short-term lease exception provided for in the standard and therefore will only recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term greater than one year. The company further intends to elect the option to apply the transition provisions of the new standard at the adoption date instead of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The company plans to elect the package of practical expedients to not re-evaluate existing lease contracts or lease classifications and therefore will not make changes to those leases already recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under ASC 840 until the leases are fully amortized, amended, or modified. In addition, the company will not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases. The company intends to apply the land easement practical expedient. Chevron plans to elect the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components for most asset classes except for certain asset classes that have significant non-lease (i.e., service) components in addition to the lease component. The company will reclassify some contracts, currently not classified as leases, as operating leases under the new standard. The company completed accounting policy and disclosure updates and system implementation necessary to meet the standard's requirements. The company does not expect the adoption of the ASU to have a material impact on finance leases, which are currently referred to as capital leases. The company estimates that the operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are approximately $4 billion , as of January 1, 2019. The company expects the implementation of the standard will have a minimal impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which becomes effective for the company beginning January 1, 2020. The standard requires companies to use forward-looking information to calculate credit loss estimates. The company is evaluating the effect of the standard on the companys consolidated financial statements. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Note 5  Lease Commitments Certain noncancelable leases are classified as capital leases, and the leased assets are included as part of Properties, plant and equipment, at cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Such leasing arrangements involve crude oil production and processing equipment, vessels, office buildings, and other facilities. Other leases are classified as operating leases and are not capitalized. The payments on operating leases are recorded as expense. Details of the capitalized leased assets are below: ##TABLE_START  At December 31     Upstream $   $ Downstream   All Other     Total   Less: Accumulated amortization   Net capitalized leased assets $   $ ##TABLE_ENDRental expenses incurred for operating leases during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31      Minimum rentals $   $  $ Contingent rentals    Total    Less: Sublease rental income    Net rental expense $   $  $ ##TABLE_ENDContingent rentals are based on factors other than the passage of time, principally sales volumes at leased service stations. Certain leases include escalation clauses for adjusting rentals to reflect changes in price indices, renewal options, and options to purchase the leased property during or at the end of the initial or renewal lease period for the fair market value or other specified amount at that time. At December 31, 2018 , the estimated future minimum lease payments (net of noncancelable sublease rentals) under operating and capital leases, which at inception had a noncancelable term of more than one year, were as follows: ##TABLE_START   At December 31    Operating Leases   Capital Leases * Year $   $  492    378    242    166    Thereafter   Total $ 2,159   $ Less: Amounts representing interest and executory costs    $ (88 ) Net present values    Less: Capital lease obligations included in short-term debt    (18 ) Long-term capital lease obligations    $ * Excluded from the table is an executed but not-yet-commenced capital lease with payments of $14, $15, $22, $21, $21, and $219 for 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and thereafter, respectively. ##TABLE_ENDNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Note 6  Summarized Financial Data  Chevron U.S.A.

Marketable Securities The company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2018 . Derivatives  The company records its derivative instruments  other than any commodity derivative contracts that are designated as normal purchase and normal sale  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts principally with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values of which are Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. The company does not materially adjust this information.

At December 31, 2018 , these investments are classified as Level 1 and include restricted funds related to certain upstream abandonment activities, tax payments and a financing program, which are reported in Deferred charges and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Long-term debt, excluding capital lease obligations, of $18,706 and $23,477 at December 31, 2018 , and December 31, 2017 , respectively, had estimated fair values of $18,729 and $23,943 , respectively. Long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued bonds. The fair value of corporate bonds is $17,858 and classified as Level 1. The fair value of other long-term debt is $871 and classified as Level 2. The carrying values of short-term financial assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values. Fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , were not material. Note 9 Financial and Derivative Instruments Derivative Commodity Instruments The companys derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas and refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. None of the companys derivative instruments is designated as a hedging instrument, although certain of the companys affiliates make such designation. The companys derivatives are not material to the companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity derivative activities. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts The company uses derivative commodity instruments traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic platforms of the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, the company enters into swap contracts and option contracts principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the over-the-counter markets, which are governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements and other master netting arrangements. Depending on the nature of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required.

Amounts not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet represent positions that do not meet all the conditions for \"a right of offset.\" Concentrations of Credit Risk The companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, time deposits, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The companys short-term investments are placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. Company investment policies limit the companys exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk. Similar policies on diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the companys counterparties in derivative instruments. The trade receivable balances, reflecting the companys diversified sources of revenue, are dispersed among the companys broad customer base worldwide. As a result, the company believes concentrations of credit risk are limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring pre-payments, letters of credit or other acceptable collateral instruments to support sales to customers. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Note 10  Assets Held for Sale At December 31, 2018 , the company classified $1,863 of net properties, plant and equipment as Assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets are primarily associated with upstream operations that are anticipated to be sold in the next 12 months. The revenues and earnings contributions of these assets in 2018 were not material. Note 11  Equity Retained earnings at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , included approximately $22,362 and $18,473 , respectively, for the companys share of undistributed earnings of equity affiliates. At December 31, 2018 , about 78 million shares of Chevrons common stock remained available for issuance from the 260 million shares that were reserved for issuance under the Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan. In addition, 748,211 shares remain available for issuance from the 1,600,000 shares of the companys common stock that were reserved for awards under the Chevron Corporation Non-Employee Directors Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan. Note 12  Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share (EPS) is based upon Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation (earnings) and includes the effects of deferrals of salary and other compensation awards that are invested in Chevron stock units by certain officers and employees of the company. Diluted EPS includes the effects of these items as well as the dilutive effects of outstanding stock options awarded under the companys stock option programs (refer to Note 21 , Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation, beginning on page 80 ). The table below sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS: ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31      Basic EPS Calculation       Earnings available to common stockholders - Basic 1 $ 14,824   $ 9,195  $ (497 ) Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 2 1,897   1,882  1,872 Add: Deferred awards held as stock units    Total weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 1,898   1,883  1,873 Earnings per share of common stock - Basic $ 7.81   $ 4.88  $ (0.27 ) Diluted EPS Calculation       Earnings available to common stockholders - Diluted 1 $ 14,824   $ 9,195  $ (497 ) Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 2 1,897   1,882  1,872 Add: Deferred awards held as stock units    Add: Dilutive effect of employee stock-based awards     Total weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 1,914   1,898  1,873 Earnings per share of common stock - Diluted $ 7.74   $ 4.85  $ (0.27 )  1 There was no effect of dividend equivalents paid on stock units or dilutive impact of employee stock-based awards on earnings. 2 Millions of shares; 10 million shares of employee-based awards were not included in the 2016 diluted EPS calculation as the result would be anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_ENDNote 13 Operating Segments and Geographic Data Although each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the companys reportable segments and operating segments. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts The companys segments are managed by segment managers who report to the chief operating decision maker (CODM). The segments represent components of the company that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available. The companys primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile. Other components of the companys operations are reported as \"International (outside the United States). Segment Earnings  The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis.

At December 31, 2018 , the companys carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $120 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCOs net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCOs net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project with a balance of $2,060 , including accrued interest. See Note 7 , on page 63 , for summarized financial information for 100 percent of TCO. Petropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the heavy oil Huyapari Field and upgrading project in Venezuelas Orinoco Belt. At December 31, 2018 , the companys carrying value of its investment in Petropiar was approximately $136 less than the amount of underlying equity in Petropiars net assets. The difference represents the excess of Chevrons underlying equity in Petropiars net assets over the net book value of the assets contributed to the venture. Petroboscan Chevron has a 39.2 percent interest in Petroboscan, a joint stock company which operates the Boscan Field in Venezuela. At December 31, 2018 , the companys carrying value of its investment in Petroboscan was approximately $97 higher than the amount of underlying equity in Petroboscans net assets. The difference reflects the excess of the net book value of the assets contributed by Chevron over its underlying equity in Petroboscans net assets. The company also has an outstanding long-term loan to Petroboscan of $626 at year-end 2018 . Caspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, a variable interest entity, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak. The company has investments and advances totaling $1,022 , which includes long-term loans of $468 at year-end 2018 . The loans were provided to fund 30 percent of the initial pipeline construction. The company is not the primary beneficiary of the consortium because it does not direct activities of the consortium and only receives its proportionate share of the financial returns. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Angola LNG Limited  Chevron has a 36.4 percent interest in Angola LNG Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. The other half is owned by Phillips 66. GS Caltex Corporation  Chevron owns 50 percent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy. The joint venture imports, refines and markets petroleum products, petrochemicals and lubricants, predominantly in South Korea. Other Information Sales and other operating revenues on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes $10,378 , $8,165 and $5,786 with affiliated companies for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Purchased crude oil and products includes $6,598 , $4,800 and $3,468 with affiliated companies for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Accounts and notes receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $884 and $1,141 due from affiliated companies at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Accounts payable includes $631 and $498 due to affiliated companies at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The following table provides summarized financial information on a 100 percent basis for all equity affiliates as well as Chevrons total share, which includes Chevron's net loans to affiliates of $3,402 , $3,853 and $3,535 at December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. ##TABLE_START  Affiliates   Chevron Share  Year ended December 31      Total revenues $ 84,469  $ 70,744  $ 59,253  $ 40,679  $ 33,460  $ 27,787 Income before income tax expense 16,693  13,487  6,587  6,755  5,712  3,670 Net income attributable to affiliates 13,321  10,751  5,127  6,384  4,468  2,876 At December 31            Current assets $ 32,657  $ 33,883  $ 33,406  $ 12,813  $ 13,568  $ 13,743 Noncurrent assets 87,614  82,261  75,258  36,369  32,643  28,854 Current liabilities 26,006  26,873  24,793  9,843  10,201  8,996 Noncurrent liabilities 20,000  21,447  22,671  4,446  4,224  4,255 Total affiliates' net equity $ 74,265  $ 67,824  $ 61,200  $ 34,893  $ 31,786  $ 29,346 ##TABLE_ENDNote 15  Litigation MTBE Chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. Chevron is a party to seven pending lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. Resolution of these lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. Additional lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future. The companys ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable. The company no longer uses MTBE in the manufacture of gasoline in the United States. Ecuador  Background Chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit initiated in the Superior Court of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio, Ecuador (\"the provincial court\"), in May 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. The lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. Until 1992, Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of this consortium with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by Petroecuador. At the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the concession area, Texpet entered into a formal agreement with the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador for Texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to Texpets ownership share of the consortium. Pursuant to that agreement, Texpet conducted a three -year remediation program at a cost of $40 . After certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the government granted Texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations. Based on the history described above, Chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit. As to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction over Chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts action, enacted in 1999, cannot be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in Ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to Texpet by the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and municipal governments. With regard to the facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms that Texpets remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects Petroecuadors failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and Petroecuadors further conduct since assuming full control over the operations. Lago Agrio Judgment  On February 14, 2011, the provincial court rendered a judgment against Chevron. The court rejected Chevrons defenses to the extent the court addressed them in its opinion. The judgment assessed approximately $8,600 in damages and approximately $900 as an award for the plaintiffs representatives. It also assessed an additional amount of approximately $8,600 in punitive damages unless the company issued a public apology within 15 days of the judgment, which Chevron did not do. On February 17, 2011, the plaintiffs appealed the judgment, seeking increased damages, and on March 11, 2011, Chevron appealed the judgment seeking to have the judgment nullified. On January 3, 2012, an appellate panel in the provincial court affirmed the February 14, 2011 decision and ordered that Chevron pay additional attorneys fees in the amount of  0.10% of the values that are derived from the decisional act of this judgment. The plaintiffs filed a petition to clarify and amplify the appellate decision on January 6, 2012, and the provincial court issued a ruling in response on January 13, 2012, purporting to clarify and amplify its January 3, 2012 ruling, which included clarification that the deadline for the company to issue a public apology to avoid the additional amount of approximately $8,600 in punitive damages was within 15 days of the clarification ruling, or February 3, 2012. Chevron did not issue an apology because doing so might be mischaracterized as an admission of liability and would be contrary to facts and evidence submitted at trial. On January 20, 2012, Chevron appealed (called a petition for cassation) the appellate panels decision to Ecuadors National Court of Justice (the National Court). On February 17, 2012, the appellate panel of the provincial court admitted Chevrons cassation appeal in a procedural step necessary for the National Court to hear the appeal. On March 29, 2012, the matter was transferred from the provincial court to the National Court, and on November 22, 2012, the National Court agreed to hear Chevron's cassation appeal. On August 3, 2012, the provincial court approved a court-appointed liquidators report on damages that calculated the total judgment in the case to be $19,100 . On November 13, 2013, the National Court ratified the judgment but nullified the $8,600 punitive damage assessment, resulting in a judgment of $9,500 . On December 23, 2013, Chevron appealed the decision to the Ecuador Constitutional Court, Ecuador's highest court. The reporting justice of the Constitutional Court heard oral arguments on the appeal on July 16, 2015. On July 10, 2018, Ecuador's Constitutional Court released a decision rejecting Chevron's appeal, which sought to nullify the National Court's judgment against Chevron. No further appeals are available in Ecuador. Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' Enforcement Actions  Chevron has no assets in Ecuador and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' lawyers have stated in press releases and through other media that they will seek to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in various countries and otherwise disrupt Chevron's operations. On May 30, 2012, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs filed an action against Chevron Corporation, Chevron Canada Limited, and Chevron Canada Finance Limited in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada, seeking to recognize and enforce the Ecuadorian judgment. On May 1, 2013, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice held that the Court has jurisdiction over Chevron and Chevron Canada Limited for purposes of the action, but stayed the action due to the absence of evidence that Chevron Corporation has assets in Ontario. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs appealed that decision and on December 17, 2013, the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirmed the lower courts decision on jurisdiction and set aside the stay, allowing the recognition and enforcement action to be heard in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Chevron appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada and, on September 4, 2015, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and affirmed that the Ontario Superior Court of Justice has jurisdiction over Chevron and Chevron Canada Limited for purposes of the action. On January 20, 2017, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granted Chevron Canada Limiteds and Chevron Corporations motions for summary judgment, concluding that the two companies are separate legal entities with separate rights and obligations. As a result, the Superior Court dismissed the recognition and enforcement claim against Chevron Canada Limited. Chevron Corporation still remains as a defendant in the action. On February 3, 2017, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs appealed the Superior Court's January 20, 2017 decision. On May 24, 2018, the Court of Appeal for Ontario upheld the Superior Courts dismissal of Chevron Canada Limited from the case. On June 22, 2018, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs filed leave to appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario to the Supreme Court of Canada. On June 27, 2012, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs filed a complaint against Chevron Corporation in the Superior Court of Justice in Brasilia, Brazil, seeking to recognize and enforce the Ecuadorian judgment. On May 13, 2015, the public prosecutor issued its nonbinding opinion and recommended that the Superior Court of Justice reject the plaintiffs' recognition and enforcement request, finding, among other things, that the Lago Agrio judgment was procured through fraud and corruption and cannot be recognized in Brazil because it violates Brazilian and international public order. On November 29, 2017, the Superior Court Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts of Justice issued a decision dismissing the Lago Agrio plaintiffs recognition and enforcement proceeding based on jurisdictional grounds. On June 15, 2018, this decision became a final judgment in Brazil. On October 15, 2012, the provincial court issued an ex parte embargo order that purports to order the seizure of assets belonging to separate Chevron subsidiaries in Ecuador, Argentina and Colombia. On November 6, 2012, at the request of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs, a court in Argentina issued a Freeze Order against Chevron Argentina S.R.L. and another Chevron subsidiary. On January 30, 2013, an appellate court upheld the Freeze Order, but on June 4, 2013 the Supreme Court of Argentina revoked the Freeze Order in its entirety. On December 12, 2013, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs served Chevron with notice of their filing of an enforcement proceeding in the National Court, First Instance, of Argentina. Chevron filed its answer on February 27, 2014, to which the Lago Agrio plaintiffs responded on December 29, 2015. On April 19, 2016, the public prosecutor in Argentina issued a non-binding opinion recommending to the National Court, First Instance, of Argentina that it reject the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' request to recognize the Ecuadorian judgment in Argentina. On February 24, 2017, the public prosecutor in Argentina issued a supplemental opinion reaffirming its previous recommendations. On November 1, 2017, the National Court, First Instance, of Argentina issued a decision dismissing the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' recognition and enforcement proceeding based on jurisdictional grounds. On November 2, 2017, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Federal Civil Court of Appeals. On July 3, 2018, the Federal Civil Court of Appeals affirmed the National Court, First Instances, dismissal of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs recognition and enforcement action based on jurisdictional grounds. On October 5, 2018, the Federal Civil Court of Appeals granted, in part, the admissibility of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs appeal to the Supreme Court of Argentina. Chevron continues to believe the Ecuadorian judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable in Ecuador, the United States and other countries. The company also believes the judgment is the product of fraud, and contrary to the legitimate scientific evidence. Chevron cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of any enforcement action. Chevron expects to continue a vigorous defense of any imposition of liability and to contest and defend any and all enforcement actions. Company's Bilateral Investment Treaty Arbitration Claims  Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim in September 2009 against the Republic of Ecuador before an arbitral tribunal presiding in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague under the Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. The claim alleges violations of the Republic of Ecuadors obligations under the United StatesEcuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) and breaches of the settlement and release agreements between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet (described above), which are investment agreements protected by the BIT. Through the arbitration, Chevron and Texpet are seeking relief against the Republic of Ecuador, including a declaration that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation constitutes a violation of Ecuadors obligations under the BIT. On January 25, 2012, the Tribunal issued its First Interim Measures Award requiring the Republic of Ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and outside of Ecuador of any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case pending further order of the Tribunal. On February 16, 2012, the Tribunal issued a Second Interim Award mandating that the Republic of Ecuador take all measures necessary (whether by its judicial, legislative or executive branches) to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement and recognition within and outside of Ecuador of the judgment against Chevron. On February 27, 2012, the Tribunal issued a Third Interim Award confirming its jurisdiction to hear Chevron's arbitration claims. On February 7, 2013, the Tribunal issued its Fourth Interim Award in which it declared that the Republic of Ecuador has violated the First and Second Interim Awards under the [BIT], the UNCITRAL Rules and international law in regard to the finalization and enforcement subject to execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment within and outside Ecuador, including (but not limited to) Canada, Brazil and Argentina. The Republic of Ecuador subsequently filed in the District Court of The Hague a request to set aside the Tribunals Interim Awards and the First Partial Award (described below), and on January 20, 2016, the District Court denied the Republic's request. On April 13, 2016, the Republic of Ecuador appealed the decision. On July 18, 2017, the Appeals Court of The Hague denied the Republic's appeal. On October 18, 2017, the Republic appealed the decision of the Appeals Court of The Hague to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands. The Tribunal has divided the merits phase of the proceeding into three phases. On September 17, 2013, the Tribunal issued its First Partial Award from Phase One, finding that the settlement agreements between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet applied to Texpet and Chevron, released Texpet and Chevron from claims based on \"collective\" or \"diffuse\" rights arising from Texpet's operations in the former concession area and precluded third parties from asserting collective/diffuse rights environmental claims relating to Texpet's operations in the former concession area but did not preclude individual claims for personal harm. The Tribunal held a hearing on April 29-30, 2014, to address remaining issues relating to Phase One, and on March 12, 2015, it issued a nonbinding decision that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' complaint, on its face, includes claims not barred by the settlement agreement between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet. In the same decision, the Tribunal deferred to Phase Two remaining issues from Phase One, including whether the Republic of Ecuador breached the 1995 settlement Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts agreement and the remedies that are available to Chevron and Texpet as a result of that breach. Phase Two issues were addressed at a hearing held in April and May 2015. On August 30, 2018, the Tribunal issued its Phase Two award in favor of Chevron and Texpet. The Tribunal unanimously held that the Ecuadorian judgment was procured through fraud, bribery and corruption and was based on claims that the Republic of Ecuador had settled and released in the mid-1990s, concluding that the Ecuadorian judgment violates international public policy and should not be recognized or enforced by the courts of other States. Specifically, the Tribunal found that (i) the Republic of Ecuador breached its obligations under the 1995 and 1998 settlement agreements releasing Texpet and its affiliates from public environmental claims (the same claims on which the Ecuadorian judgment was exclusively based) and (ii) the Republic of Ecuador committed a denial of justice under customary international law and under the fair and equitable treatment provision of the BIT due to the fraud and corruption in the Lago Agrio litigation. The Tribunal also found that Texpet satisfied its environmental remediation obligations with a $40 remediation program and that Ecuador certified that Texpet had performed all of its obligations under its settlement agreement. Among other things, the Tribunal ordered the Republic of Ecuador to: (a) take immediate steps to remove the status of enforceability from the Ecuadorian judgment; (b) promptly advise in writing any State where the Lago Agrio plaintiffs may be seeking the enforcement or recognition of the Ecuadorian judgment of the Tribunals declarations, orders and awards; (c) take measures to wipe out all the consequences of Ecuador's \"internationally wrongful acts in regard to the Ecuadorian judgment;\" and (d) compensate Chevron for any injuries resulting from the Ecuadorian judgment. On December 10, 2018, the Republic of Ecuador filed in the District Court of The Hague a request to set aside the Tribunal's Phase Two Award. The Tribunal has not set a date for Phase Three, the third and final phase of the arbitration, at which damages for Chevron's injuries will be determined. Company's RICO Action  In February 2011, Chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters, alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and other state laws. Through the civil lawsuit, Chevron sought relief that included a declaration that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable. The trial commenced on October 15, 2013 and concluded on November 22, 2013. On March 4, 2014, the Federal District Court entered a judgment in favor of Chevron, prohibiting the defendants from seeking to enforce the Lago Agrio judgment in the United States and further prohibiting them from profiting from their illegal acts. The defendants appealed the Federal District Court's decision, and, on April 20, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard oral arguments. On August 8, 2016, the Second Circuit issued a unanimous opinion affirming in full the judgment of the Federal District Court. On October 27, 2016, the Second Circuit denied the defendants' petitions for en banc rehearing of the opinion on their appeal. On March 27, 2017, two of the defendants filed a petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. On June 19, 2017, the United States Supreme Court denied the defendants' petition for a Writ of Certiorari. Management's Assessment The ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on Chevron, remains uncertain. Management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in this case. Due to the defects associated with the Ecuadorian judgment, management does not believe the judgment has any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). Moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).

The 2018 increase in income tax charge of $5,763 , from a benefit of $48 in 2017 to a charge of $5,715 in 2018, is a result of the year-over-year increase in total income before income tax expense, which is primarily due to higher crude oil realizations offset by lower gains on asset sales in 2018 compared to 2017. U.S. tax reform resulted in a benefit of $2,020 being recognized in 2017 reflecting the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. The companys effective tax rate changed from (0.5) percent in 2017 to 28 percent in 2018 . The change in effective tax rate is a consequence of the mix effect resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions and the impact of U.S. tax reform to both the 2018 and 2017 results. As noted above, U.S. tax reform resulted in the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2017. The U.S. tax return for 2017 was prepared and filed in 2018 and did not result in any material change to the the provisional amounts that were recognized in 2017, and the amounts are now considered final. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts The company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis. The reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following: ##TABLE_START     At December 31    Deferred tax liabilities     Properties, plant and equipment $ 20,159   $ 19,869 Investments and other 4,943   4,796 Total deferred tax liabilities 25,102   24,665 Deferred tax assets     Foreign tax credits (10,536 )   (11,872 ) Asset retirement obligations/environmental reserves (5,328 )   (5,511 ) Employee benefits (2,787 )   (3,129 ) Deferred credits (1,373 )   (1,769 ) Tax loss carryforwards (4,948 )   (5,463 ) Other accrued liabilities (595 )   (842 ) Inventory (505 )   (336 ) Miscellaneous (3,481 )   (2,415 ) Total deferred tax assets (29,553 )   (31,337 ) Deferred tax assets valuation allowance 15,973   16,574 Total deferred taxes, net $ 11,522   $ 9,902 ##TABLE_ENDDeferred tax liabilities at the end of 2018 increased by approximately $400 from year-end 2017 . The increase was primarily related to property, plant and equipment temporary differences. Deferred tax assets decreased by approximately $1,800 in 2018. The decrease primarily related to lower foreign tax credits and the utilization of tax loss carryforwards. The overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. It reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in managements assessment, more likely than not to be realized. At the end of 2018 , the company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately $13,731 and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,198 , primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2019 through 2036 . U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $10,536 will expire between 2019 and 2028 . At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , deferred taxes were classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: ##TABLE_START  At December 31     Deferred charges and other assets $ (4,399 )   $ (4,750 ) Noncurrent deferred income taxes 15,921   14,652 Total deferred income taxes, net $ 11,522   $ 9,902 ##TABLE_ENDEnactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017 imposed a one-time U.S. federal tax on the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings indefinitely reinvested abroad, which did not have a material impact on the companys financial results. The indefinite reinvestment assertion continues to apply for the purpose of determining deferred tax liabilities for U.S. state and foreign withholding tax purposes. U.S. state and foreign withholding taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately $59,900 at December 31, 2018 . This amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the companys ongoing international business. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of state and foreign taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. The company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. Uncertain Income Tax Positions The company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if managements assessment is that the position is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent ) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term tax position in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts The following table indicates the changes to the companys unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . The term unrecognized tax benefits in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements. Interest and penalties are not included. ##TABLE_START     Balance at January 1 $ 4,828   $ 3,031  $ 3,042 Foreign currency effects (6 )    Additions based on tax positions taken in current year   1,853  Additions for tax positions taken in prior years   1,166  Reductions for tax positions taken in prior years (131 )   (90 )  (390 ) Settlements with taxing authorities in current year (13 )   (1,173 )  (36 ) Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations    (2 )  (12 ) Balance at December 31 $ 5,070   $ 4,828  $ 3,031 ##TABLE_ENDApproximately 82 percent of the $5,070 of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2018 , would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized. Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition. Tax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. For the companys major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31, 2018 . For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows: United States  2013 , Nigeria  2000 , Australia  2006 and Kazakhstan  2007 . The company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions. Both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the companys total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits. On the Consolidated Statement of Income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as Income tax expense. As of December 31, 2018 , accruals of $33 for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared with accruals of $178 as of year-end 2017 . Income tax expense (benefit) associated with interest and penalties was $8 , $(161) and $38 in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. ##TABLE_START Taxes Other Than on Income Year ended December 31      United States       Excise and similar taxes on products and merchandise* $ 4,830   $ 4,398  $ 4,335 Consumer excise taxes collected on behalf of third parties* (4,830 )      Import duties and other levies    Property and other miscellaneous taxes 1,577   1,824  1,680 Payroll taxes    Taxes on production    Total United States 2,163   6,680  6,435 International       Excise and similar taxes on products and merchandise* 3,031   2,791  2,570 Consumer excise taxes collected on behalf of third parties* (3,031 )      Import duties and other levies    Property and other miscellaneous taxes 2,370   2,563  2,379 Payroll taxes    Taxes on production    Total International 2,704   5,651  5,233 Total taxes other than on income $ 4,867   $ 12,331  $ 11,668 ##TABLE_END* Beginning in 2018, these taxes are netted in \"Taxes other than on income\" in accordance with ASU 2014-09.

The company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. At December 31, 2018 , the company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt. At December 31, 2018 , the company had $9,900 in committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The credit facilities consist of a 364 -day facility which enables borrowing of up to $9,575 and allows the company to convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, and a $325  five -year facility expiring in December 2020 . These facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The companys practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the companys strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2018 . Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts The company classified $9,900 and $10,000 of short-term debt as long-term at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, and the company has both the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. Note 19  Long-Term Debt  Total long-term debt including capital lease obligations at December 31, 2018 , was $28,733 .

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Note 20  Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells  The company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well, and (b) the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either condition is not met or if the company obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense. The following table indicates the changes to the companys suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended December 31, 2018 : ##TABLE_START  2017 Beginning balance at January 1 $ 3,702 $ 3,540 $ 3,312 Additions to capitalized exploratory well costs pending the determination of proved reserves 323 Reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment based on the determination of proved reserves (13 ) (113 ) (119 ) Capitalized exploratory well costs charged to expense (333 ) (39 ) (118 ) Other reductions *  (9 )  Ending balance at December 31 $ 3,563 $ 3,702 $ 3,540 ##TABLE_END* Represents property sales. The following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling. ##TABLE_START  At December 31   2017 Exploratory well costs capitalized for a period of one year or less $ $ $ Exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year 3,361 3,395 3,095 Balance at December 31 $ 3,563 $ 3,702 $ 3,540 Number of projects with exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year * 32 ##TABLE_END* Certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both. Of the $3,361 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31, 2018 , $1,585 ( 14 projects) is related to projects that had drilling activities underway or firmly planned for the near future. The $1,776 balance is related to 16 projects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not underway or firmly planned for the near future. Additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development. The projects for the $1,776 referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects economic viability: (a) $672 ( three projects)  undergoing front-end engineering and design with final investment decision expected within four years ; (b) $93 ( one project)  development concept under review by government; (c) $963 ( eight projects)  development alternatives under review; (d) $48 ( four projects)  miscellaneous activities for projects with smaller amounts suspended. While progress was being made on all 30 projects, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations associated with the projects. More than half of these decisions are expected to occur in the next five years . The $3,361 of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of December 31, 2018 , represents 153 exploratory wells in 30 projects. The tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project basis: ##TABLE_START Aging based on drilling completion date of individual wells: Amount   Number of wells 1998-2007 $   2008-2012 1,076   2013-2017 1,875   Total $ 3,361        Aging based on drilling completion date of last suspended well in project: Amount   Number of projects 2003-2010 $   2011-2014   2015-2018 2,129   Total $ 3,361   ##TABLE_ENDNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Note 21  Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation Compensation expense for stock options for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $105 ( $83 after tax), $137 ( $89 after tax) and $271 ( $176 after tax), respectively. In addition, compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares and restricted stock units was $60 ( $47 after tax), $231 ( $150 after tax) and $371 ( $241 after tax) for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. No significant stock-based compensation cost was capitalized at December 31, 2018 , or December 31, 2017 . Cash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $1,159 , $1,100 and $647 , respectively. Actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from option exercises were $43 , $48 and $21 for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Cash paid to settle performance shares, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights was $157 , $187 and $82 for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Awards under the Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and nonstock grants. From April 2004 through May 2023, no more than 260 million shares may be issued under the LTIP. For awards issued on or after May 29, 2013, no more than 50 million of those shares may be in a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for shares by the award recipient. For the major types of awards issued before January 1, 2017, the contractual terms vary between three years for the performance shares and restricted stock units, and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights. For awards issued after January 1, 2017, contractual terms vary between three years for the performance shares and special restricted stock units, five years for standard restricted stock units and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights. Forfeitures for performance shares, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights are recognized as they occur. Forfeitures for stock options are estimated using historical forfeiture data dating back to 1990. The fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted-average assumptions: ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31      Expected term in years 1 6.5 6.3 6.3 Volatility 2 21.2 % 21.7 % 21.7 % Risk-free interest rate based on zero coupon U.S. treasury note 2.6 % 2.2 % 1.6 % Dividend yield 3.8 % 4.2 % 4.5 % Weighted-average fair value per option granted $ 18.18 $ 15.31 $ 9.53 ##TABLE_END1 Expected term is based on historical exercise and post-vesting cancellation data. 2 Volatility rate is based on historical stock prices over an appropriate period, generally equal to the expected term.

During this period, the company continued its practice of issuing treasury shares upon exercise of these awards. As of December 31, 2018 , there was $53 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. At January 1, 2018 , the number of LTIP performance shares outstanding was equivalent to 3,090,793 shares. During 2018 , 1,491,141 performance shares were granted, 746,450 shares vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 165,754 shares were forfeited. At December 31, 2018 , performance shares outstanding were 3,669,730 . The fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was $258 , and was measured using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts At January 1, 2018 , the number of restricted stock units outstanding was equivalent to 1,236,500 shares. During 2018, 819,769 restricted stock units were granted, 222,946 units vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 95,844 units were forfeited. At December 31, 2018 , restricted stock units outstanding were 1,737,479 . The fair value of the liability recorded for the vested portion of these instruments was $125 , valued at the stock price as of December 31, 2018 . In addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights that were granted under LTIP totaled approximately 4.2 million equivalent shares as of December 31, 2018 . The fair value of the liability recorded for the vested portion of these instruments was $70 . Note 22  Employee Benefit Plans  The company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States, all qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the companys other investment alternatives. The company also sponsors other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. For the company's main U.S. medical plan, the increase to the pre-Medicare company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company. The company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The funded status of the companys pension and OPEB plans for 2018 and 2017 follows: ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits          Other Benefits   U.S.  Intl.   U.S.  Intl.

These amortization periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans. These losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10 percent of the higher of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. The amount subject to amortization is determined on a plan-by-plan basis. During 2019 , the company estimates actuarial losses of $239 , $19 and $(3) will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss for U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans, respectively. In addition, the company estimates an additional $290 will be recognized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss during 2019 related to lump-sum settlement costs from the main U.S. pension plans. The weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs (credits) recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2018 , was approximately 4 and 8 years for U.S. and international pension plans, respectively, and 8 years for OPEB plans. During 2019 , the company estimates prior service (credits) costs of $2 , $12 and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts $(28) will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss for U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans, respectively. Assumptions The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits                    Other Benefits   U.S. Intl.   U.S. Intl.  U.S. Intl.     Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations:                 Discount rate 4.2 % 4.4 %   3.5 % 3.9 %  3.9 % 4.3 %  4.4 %   3.8 %  4.3 % Rate of compensation increase 4.5 % 4.0 %   4.5 % 4.0 %  4.5 % 4.5 %  N/A   N/A  N/A Assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost:                 Discount rate for service cost 3.7 % 3.9 %   4.2 % 4.3 %  4.4 % 5.3 %  3.9 %   4.6 %  4.9 % Discount rate for interest cost 3.0 % 3.9 %   3.0 % 4.3 %  3.0 % 5.3 %  3.5 %   3.8 %  4.0 % Expected return on plan assets 6.8 % 5.5 %   6.8 % 5.5 %  7.3 % 6.3 %  N/A   N/A  N/A Rate of compensation increase 4.5 % 4.0 %   4.5 % 4.5 %  4.5 % 4.8 %  N/A   N/A  N/A ##TABLE_ENDExpected Return on Plan Assets The companys estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the companys estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies. For 2018 , the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent for U.S. pension plan assets, which account for 67 percent of the companys pension plan assets. In 2017 , the company used a long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent for these plans, and in 2016 , 7.25 percent . The market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the three -month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense. Discount Rate The discount rate assumptions used to determine the U.S. and international pension and OPEB plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis. This analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company's plans and the yields on high-quality bonds. The projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The effective discount rates derived from this analysis at the end of 2018 were 4.2 percent for the main U.S. pension plan and 4.3 percent for the main U.S. OPEB plan. The discount rates for these plans at the end of 2017 were 3.5 and 3.6 percent , respectively, while in 2016 they were 3.9 and 4.1 percent for these plans, respectively. Other Benefit Assumptions Assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for retiree health care costs. For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2018 , for the main U.S. OPEB plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 7.2 percent in 2019 and gradually decline to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. For this measurement at December 31, 2017 , the assumed health care cost-trend rates started with 7.4 percent in 2018 and gradually declined to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. A 1-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost-trend rates would have the following effects on worldwide plans: ##TABLE_START  1 Percent Increase  1 Percent Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components $  $ (10 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $  $ (156 ) ##TABLE_ENDPlan Assets and Investment Strategy  The fair value measurements of the companys pension plans for 2018 and 2017 are on the following page: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts ##TABLE_START  U.S.    Intl.

The companys U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise 91 percent of the total pension assets. Both the U.S. and U.K. plans have an Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. To assess the plans investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established. For the primary U.S. pension plan, the company's Investment Committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges: Equities 30  60 percent , Fixed Income and Cash 20  65 percent , Real Estate 0  15 percent , and Alternative Investments 0  15 percent . For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board of Trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines: Equities 25  45 percent , Fixed Income and Cash 40  75 percent , and Real Estate 5  15 percent . The other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan. Actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors, including market conditions and illiquidity constraints. To mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds. The company does not prefund its OPEB obligations. Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments In 2018 , the company contributed $803 and $232 to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. In 2019 , the company expects contributions to be approximately $700 to its U.S. plans and $200 to its international pension plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments, tax law changes and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations. The company anticipates paying OPEB benefits of approximately $175 in 2019 ; $166 was paid in 2018 . The following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be paid by the company in the next 10 years: ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits   Other  U.S.  Intl.

Compensation expense for the ESIP totaled $270 , $316 and $281 in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Benefit Plan Trusts Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. At year-end 2018 , the trust contained 14.2 million shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. The company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trusts beneficiaries. The shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations. Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , trust assets of $34 and $35 , respectively, were invested primarily in interest-earning accounts. Employee Incentive Plans The Chevron Incentive Plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to corporate, business unit and individual performance in the prior year. Charges to expense for cash bonuses were $1,048 , $936 and $662 in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Chevron also has the LTIP for officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. Awards under the LTIP consist of stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in Note 21 , beginning on page 80 . Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Note 23  Other Contingencies and Commitments Income Taxes The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated. Refer to Note 16 , beginning on page 74 , for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the companys major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Settlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate provisions have been made for all years under examination or subject to future examination. Guarantees  The company has two guarantees to equity affiliates totaling $968 . Of this amount, $637 is associated with a financing arrangement with an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 3 -year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum amount will be reduced as payments are made by the affiliate. The remaining amount of $331 is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 9 -year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for either guarantee. Indemnifications In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200 , which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200 obligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when the indemnification expires. The environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997. Although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements  The company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drill ships, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the companys business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2019  $1,300 ; 2020  $1,200 ; 2021  $1,300 ; 2022  $1,000 ; 2023  $800 ; 2023 and after  $4,700 . A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately $1,400 in 2018 , $1,300 in 2017 and $1,300 in 2016 . As part of the implementation of ASU 2016-02 (Topic 842) effective January 1, 2019, the company will reclassify some contracts, currently incorporated into the unconditional purchase obligations disclosure, as operating leases in first quarter 2019 results. Environmental The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including MTBE, by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various operating, closed and divested sites, including, but not limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, chemical plants, marketing facilities, crude oil fields, and mining sites. Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities. The amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. These future costs may be material to results of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts operations in the period in which they are recognized, but the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Chevrons environmental reserve as of December 31, 2018 , was $1,327 . Included in this balance was $258 related to remediation activities at approximately 144 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal Superfund law or analogous state laws which provide for joint and several liability for all responsible parties. Any future actions by regulatory agencies to require Chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the companys results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. Of the remaining year-end 2018 environmental reserves balance of $1,069 , $748 is related to the companys U.S. downstream operations, $24 to its international downstream operations, $296 to upstream operations and $1 to other businesses. Liabilities at all sites were primarily associated with the companys plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the United States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state and local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2018 had a recorded liability that was material to the companys results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. Refer to Note 2 4 on page 88 for a discussion of the companys asset retirement obligations. Other Contingencies  Governmental and other entities in California and other jurisdictions have filed legal proceedings against fossil fuel producing companies, including Chevron, purporting to seek legal and equitable relief to address alleged impacts of climate change. Further such proceedings are likely to be filed by other parties. The unprecedented legal theories set forth in these proceedings entail the possibility of damages liability and injunctions against the production of all fossil fuels that, while we believe remote, could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and financial condition. Management believes that these proceedings are legally and factually meritless and detract from constructive efforts to address the important policy issues presented by climate change, and will vigorously defend against such proceedings. Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; joint venture partners; U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; suppliers; and individuals. The amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve, and may result in gains or losses in future periods. The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or together, may result in significant gains or losses in future periods. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Note 24 Asset Retirement Obligations The company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) both as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or method of settlement that may be beyond the companys control. This uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value. Recognition of the ARO includes: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, (2) the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates. AROs are primarily recorded for the companys crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews of its downstream long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation. The following table indicates the changes to the companys before-tax asset retirement obligations in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : ##TABLE_START     Balance at January 1 $ 14,214   $ 14,243  $ 15,642 Liabilities incurred    Liabilities settled (830 )   (1,721 )  (1,658 ) Accretion expense    Revisions in estimated cash flows (84 )    (694 ) Balance at December 31 $ 14,050   $ 14,214  $ 14,243 ##TABLE_ENDIn the table above, the amount associated with \"Revisions in estimated cash flows\" in 2018 reflects decreased cost estimates to abandon wells, equipment and facilities. The long-term portion of the $14,050 balance at the end of 2018 was $12,957 . Note 25  Revenue On January 1, 2018, Chevron adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , and its related amendments using the modified retrospective transition method, which did not require the restatement of prior periods. The adoption did not result in a material change in the companys accounting or have a material effect on the companys financial position, including the measurement of revenue, the timing of revenue recognition and the recognition of contract assets, liabilities and related costs. The most significant change is the presentation of excise, value-added and similar taxes collected on behalf of third parties, which are no longer presented within Sales and other operating revenue on the Consolidated Statement of Income starting in 2018. These taxes, which totaled $7,861 in 2018 , are now netted in Taxes other than on income on the Consolidated Statement of Income. This change to presentation had no impact on earnings. These taxes totaled $7,189 and $6,905 in 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The company applied the optional exemption to not report any unfulfilled performance obligations related to contracts that have terms of less than one year. The amount of future revenue for unfulfilled performance obligations under long-term contracts with fixed components was insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2018 . Revenue from contracts with customers is presented in Sales and other operating revenue along with some activity that is accounted for outside the scope of ASC 606, which is not material to this line, on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in purchased crude oil and products on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Refer to Note 13 beginning on page 66 for additional information on the companys segmentation of revenue. Receivables related to revenue from contracts with customers are included in Accounts and notes receivable, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The net balance of these receivables was $9,779 and $10,046 at January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. Other items included in Accounts and notes receivable, net represent amounts due from partners for their share of joint venture operating and project costs and amounts due from Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts others, primarily related to derivatives, leases, buy/sell arrangements and product exchanges, which are accounted for outside the scope of ASC 606 . Contract assets and related costs are reflected in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and contract liabilities are reflected in Accrued liabilities and Deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts for these items are not material to the companys financial position. Note 26  Other Financial Information Earnings in 2018 included after-tax gains of approximately $630 relating to the sale of certain properties. Of this amount, approximately $365 and $265 related to downstream and upstream, respectively. Earnings in 2017 included after-tax gains of approximately $1,800 relating to the sale of certain properties, of which approximately $ 850 and $950 related to downstream and upstream assets, respectively. Earnings in 2018 included after-tax charges of approximately $2,000 for impairments and other asset write-offs related to upstream. Earnings in 2017 included after-tax charges of approximately $900 for impairments and other asset write-offs related to upstream. ##TABLE_START Other financial information is as follows:        Year ended December 31      Total financing interest and debt costs $   $  $ Less: Capitalized interest    Interest and debt expense $   $  $ Research and development expenses $   $  $ Excess of replacement cost over the carrying value of inventories (LIFO method) $ 5,134   $ 3,937  $ 2,942 LIFO profits (losses) on inventory drawdowns included in earnings $   $ (5 )  $ (88 ) Foreign currency effects * $   $ (446 )  $ ##TABLE_END* Includes $416 , $(45) and $1 in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, for the companys share of equity affiliates foreign currency effects.

The company tested this goodwill for impairment during 2018 , and no impairment was required.

The company classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting  three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. Within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved reserves: probable and possible. The potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate. Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available. Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the Manager of Global Reserves, an organization that is separate from the Upstream operating organization. The Manager of Global Reserves has more than 30 years experience working in the oil and gas industry and holds both undergraduate and Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited graduate degrees in geoscience. His experience includes various technical and management roles in providing reserve and resource estimates in support of major capital and exploration projects, and more than 10 years of overseeing oil and gas reserves processes. He has been named a Distinguished Lecturer by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and is an active member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the SEPM Society of Sedimentary Geologists and the Society of Petroleum Engineers. All RAC members are degreed professionals, each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. The members are knowledgeable in SEC guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates. The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the Chevron Corporation Reserves Manual, which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves. During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the companys upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major changes are also reviewed with the companys senior leadership team including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The companys annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the Board. RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities. These reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the Chevron Corporation Reserves Manual.  Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions In 2018, additions to Chevrons proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling, production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regional geologic studies, and information from analogous reservoirs to provide reasonably certain proved reserves estimates. Both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past, and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates. Proved Undeveloped Reserves At the end of 2018, proved undeveloped reserves totaled 4.6 billion barrels of oil-equivalent (BOE), an increase of 317 million BOE from year-end 2017. The increase was due to 717 million BOE in extensions and discoveries, 69 million BOE in acquisitions, 58 million BOE in revisions and 6 million BOE in improved recovery, partially offset by the transfer of 531 million BOE to proved developed and 2 million BOE in sales. A major portion of this reserve increase is attributed to the company's activities in the Midland and Delaware basins. During 2018, investments totaling approximately $10 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. In Asia, expenditures during the year totaled approximately $4.8 billion, primarily related to development projects of the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. The United States accounted for about $3.4 billion related primarily to various development activities in the Gulf of Mexico and the Midland and Delaware basins. In Africa, about $0.7 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria, Angola and Republic of Congo. Development activities in Canada and Argentina were primarily responsible for about $0.9 billion of expenditures in Other Americas. Reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels. At year-end 2018, the company held approximately 2.1 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in three locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 600 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to the Gorgon and Wheatstone projects. The company completed construction of liquefaction and other facilities to develop this natural gas. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited occur in line with operating constraints and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 300 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, primarily due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria.  Affiliates account for about 1.2 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 900 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more, with the majority related to the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.  Annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2018, increases in commodity prices positively impacted the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in proved reserve increases, and negatively impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects. The year-end reserves volumes have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves sections. For 2018, this assessment did not result in any material changes in reserves classified as proved undeveloped. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 32 percent and 38 percent. Proved Reserve Quantities For the three years ending December 31, 2018 , the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the companys ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the companys control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, and civil unrest. At December 31, 2018 , proved reserves for the company were 12.1 billion BOE. The companys estimated net proved reserves of liquids including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil for the years 2016 , 2017 and 2018 are shown in the table on page 98 . The companys estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 99 . Noteworthy changes in liquids proved reserves for 2016 through 2018 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page: Revisions In 2016, improved field performance at various Gulf of Mexico fields, including Jack/St Malo, and in the San Joaquin Valley were primarily responsible for the 109 million barrel increase in the United States. Entitlement effects were mainly responsible for the 64 million barrel increase in the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. In Asia, entitlement effects, drilling and improved performance across numerous assets resulted in the 50 million barrel increase. In 2017, improved field performance at various Gulf of Mexico fields, including Jack/St Malo and Tahiti, and in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 280 million barrel increase in the United States. Improved field performance at various fields, including Agbami and Sonam in Nigeria, were responsible for the 79 million barrel increase in Africa. Synthetic oil reserves in Canada decreased by 42 million barrels, primarily due to entitlement effects. In the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan, entitlement effects were mainly responsible for the 53 million barrel decrease. In 2018, improved field performance at various Gulf of Mexico fields and in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 155 million barrel increase in the United States. Improved field performance at various fields, including Agbami in Nigeria and Moho-Bilondo in the Republic of Congo, were responsible for the 68 million barrel increase in Africa. Reserves in Other Americas increased by 60 million barrels, primarily due to improved field performance at the Hebron field in Canada. In Asia, improved performance across numerous assets resulted in the 37 million barrel increase. In the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan, entitlement effects were mainly responsible for the 39 million barrel decrease. Improved Recovery In 2016, improved recovery increased reserves by 293 million barrels, primarily due to the Future Growth Project in the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. Extensions and Discoveries In 2016 , extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 131 million barrel increase in the United States. In 2017, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins and the Gulf of Mexico were primarily responsible for the 458 million barrel increase in the United States. Extensions and discoveries in the Duvernay Shale in Canada were primarily responsible for the 74 million barrel increase in Other Americas. In 2018, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 532 million barrel increase in the United States. Extensions and discoveries in the Duvernay Shale in Canada and Loma Campana in Argentina were primarily responsible for the 36 million barrel increase in Other Americas. Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited Purchases In 2017, purchases of 33 million barrels in Asia were due to contract extension in the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli fields in Azerbaijan. In 2018, purchases of 50 million barrels in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins. Sales In 2016, sales of 34 million barrels in the United States were primarily in the Gulf of Mexico shelf. In 2017, sales of 57 million barrels in the United States were primarily in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and in the Midland and Delaware basins.

Net revisions of 443 BCF in Asia were primarily due to improved field performance in China and Thailand. In 2017, reservoir performance and new seismic data in the greater Gorgon area were primarily responsible for the 1.5 TCF increase in Australia. Improved performance in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 670 BCF increase in the United States. The Sonam Field in Nigeria was primarily responsible for the 184 BCF increase in Africa. In 2018, reservoir performance, well test and surveillance data at Wheatstone and the greater Gorgon area were responsible for the 1.0 TCF increase in Australia. The Bibiyana Field in Bangladesh and the Pattani Field in Thailand were primarily responsible for the 347 BCF increase in Asia. Improved performance in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 258 BCF increase in the United States. Extensions and Discoveries In 2016, extensions and discoveries of 388 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Appalachian region and the Midland and Delaware basins. In 2017, extensions and discoveries of 1.4 TCF in the United States were primarily in the Appalachian region and the Midland and Delaware basins. Extensions and discoveries in the Duvernay Shale in Canada were primarily responsible for the 319 BCF increase in Other Americas. In 2018, extensions and discoveries of 1.6 TCF in the United States were primarily in the Appalachian region and the Midland and Delaware basins. Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited Sales In 2016, sales of 544 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, Michigan and the midcontinent region. In 2017, sales of 177 BCF in the United States were primarily from the Midland and Delaware basins. Sale of the company's interests in Trinidad and Tobago was primarily responsible for the 129 BCF decrease in Other Americas. Table VI - Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is calculated in accordance with SEC and FASB requirements. This includes using the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, estimated future development and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions, estimated costs for asset retirement obligations (includes costs to retire existing wells and facilities in addition to those future wells and facilities necessary to produce proved undeveloped reserves), and estimated future income taxes based on appropriate statutory tax rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discount factors. Estimates of proved-reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuation requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and do not represent managements estimate of the companys future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves. In the following table, the caption Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows refers to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. ##TABLE_START Consolidated Companies  Affiliated Companies  Total Consolidated Other Australia/ and Affiliated Millions of dollars U.S. Americas Africa Asia Oceania Europe Total TCO Other Companies At December 31, 2018 Future cash inflows from production $ 132,512 $ 52,470 $ 56,856 $ 54,012 $ 109,116 $ 11,959 $ 416,925 $ 100,518 $ 16,928 $ 534,371 Future production costs (34,679 ) (20,691 ) (18,850 ) (17,359 ) (16,296 ) (6,609 ) (114,484 ) (24,580 ) (4,665 ) (143,729 ) Future development costs (17,322 ) (5,106 ) (4,112 ) (5,494 ) (7,757 ) (1,393 ) (41,184 ) (14,069 ) (1,692 ) (56,945 ) Future income taxes (17,369 ) (7,553 ) (23,593 ) (14,514 ) (25,519 ) (1,676 ) (90,224 ) (18,561 ) (4,496 ) (113,281 ) Undiscounted future net cash flows 63,142 19,120 10,301 16,645 59,544 2,281 171,033 43,308 6,075 220,416 10 percent midyear annual discount for timing of estimated cash flows (29,103 ) (11,136 ) (2,646 ) (4,822 ) (28,276 ) (419 ) (76,402 ) (22,025 ) (2,662 ) (101,089 ) Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows $ 34,039 $ 7,984 $ 7,655 $ 11,823 $ 31,268 $ 1,862 $ 94,631 $ 21,283 $ 3,413 $ 119,327 At December 31, 2017 Future cash inflows from production $ 94,086 $ 43,175 $ 47,828 $ 47,809 $ 77,557 $ 8,800 $ 319,255 $ 80,090 $ 13,632 $ 412,977 Future production costs (29,049 ) (20,044 ) (18,124 ) (18,640 ) (12,315 ) (6,345 ) (104,517 ) (22,050 ) (4,635 ) (131,202 ) Future development costs (10,849 ) (5,102 ) (3,808 ) (4,755 ) (6,682 ) (1,114 ) (32,310 ) (17,564 ) (1,760 ) (51,634 ) Future income taxes (10,803 ) (5,158 ) (17,845 ) (10,901 ) (17,568 ) (615 ) (62,890 ) (12,143 ) (3,250 ) (78,283 ) Undiscounted future net cash flows 43,385 12,871 8,051 13,513 40,992 119,538 28,333 3,987 151,858 10 percent midyear annual discount for timing of estimated cash flows (19,781 ) (8,483 ) (2,058 ) (3,846 ) (19,730 ) (53,691 ) (16,310 ) (1,844 ) (71,845 ) Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows $ 23,604 $ 4,388 $ 5,993 $ 9,667 $ 21,262 $ $ 65,847 $ 12,023 $ 2,143 $ 80,013 At December 31, 2016 Future cash inflows from production $ 53,777 $ 33,520 $ 39,072 $ 44,526 $ 63,781 $ 6,338 $ 241,014 $ 66,506 $ 11,244 $ 318,764 Future production costs (26,530 ) (20,413 ) (19,749 ) (19,815 ) (11,058 ) (5,500 ) (103,065 ) (13,610 ) (5,254 ) (121,929 ) Future development costs (7,830 ) (4,277 ) (4,186 ) (4,603 ) (7,804 ) (977 ) (29,677 ) (20,855 ) (2,192 ) (52,724 ) Future income taxes (3,454 ) (2,664 ) (9,684 ) (8,503 ) (13,476 ) (37,712 ) (9,613 ) (1,639 ) (48,964 ) Undiscounted future net cash flows 15,963 6,166 5,453 11,605 31,443 (70 ) 70,560 22,428 2,159 95,147 10 percent midyear annual discount for timing of estimated cash flows (5,123 ) (3,646 ) (1,336 ) (3,137 ) (15,284 ) (28,204 ) (13,902 ) (972 ) (43,078 ) Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows $ 10,840 $ 2,520 $ 4,117 $ 8,468 $ 16,159 $ $ 42,356 $ 8,526 $ 1,187 $ 52,069 ##TABLE_ENDSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited Table VII - Changes in the Standardized Measure  of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves The changes in present values between years, which can be significant, reflect changes in estimated proved-reserve quantities and prices and assumptions used in forecasting production volumes and costs.
